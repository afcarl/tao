Words cannot describe the Tao, and The Tao cannot be named. That which is eternal is unnameable. Naming is the basis of things. Free from desire you are a mystery. Caught in desire you are known. The mystery and the known are not separate. It is naming which separates us. Only through paradox can you understand.

Beauty doesn't exist; Ugliness doesn't exist: except through the other. Good doesn't exist; bad does't exist: except through the other. Long doesn't exist; short doesn't exist: except through the other. High doesn't exist; low doesn't exist: except through the other. Before doesn't exist; after doesn't exist: except through the other. Inside doesn't exist; outside doesn't exist: except through the other. Profit doesn't exist; loss doesn't exist: except through the other. Therefore the master acts without setting a goal, and teaches that there is no teaching. Freedom from duality resides with him. Everything is his, but he has nothing. Every act is his, but he expects nothing. This is his accomplishment, which can never be destroyed.


up

3

A great man who doesn't display his talent has no rivals. A wealthy man who doesn't flaunt his wealth sees no thieves. The master teaches the value of humility and the futility of ambition. He empties their minds of all they know and helps them extinguish desires. Those who think they know cannot understand him. Don't work at anything, and everything will work.


up

4

The Tao is always used, but never empties. It is eternal and infinite but is nothing. You can't find it even though it is always here. Since it creates everything how can we know who created it.


up

5

The Tao is impartial; good and evil both reside herein. The master is impartial, and regards all as equal. The Tao contains nothing but is able to create anything. As it is used, it produces. If you talk of it your understanding will grow dim. Remain impartial.


up

6

The Tao is like a valley, receptive. Your true essence is the Tao, mysterious. Because it never dies it is mysterious. As it receives all we say it is feminine. From it arise all dreams. It continues without end and death cannot stop it.


up

7

As the Tao can never die, we call it eternal. Receiving all, we call it infinite. The birthless is eternal. The desireless is infinite. Seeing this, a master seeks nothing so he has everything. He doesn't nourish the ego, so his nourishment it total.


up

8

To be truly good, be like water which benefits all without knowing. Men who aspire to ascend benefit no being. But all are benefited by the natural descent of water. This is like the Tao. So seek a dwelling for shelter. Think when the need arises. When you deal with others, do so with compassion. When you speak to others, don't lie. Work at a profession for self-refinement as well as livelihood. Lead your family by simply following them. When you follow the natural path no mistake can be made.


up

9

Acting naturally, also know when to stop naturally. Balance is lost if you would continue. Base your achievement not on results, but on whether you followed the act. When the act is complete, it is gone. This is serene.


up

10

To keep the mind balanced use the body. Breathe like an infant. Then cleanse the mind by letting go of ideas. Love people without interfering. Allow events to take their natural course. Detached from comings and goings the mind is clear. Don't bullshit yourself! By balancing it you nurture it, but it is not yours. Acting through it, but expecting no results. Perfection comes of its own accord.


up

11

Without the hole in the tap, the water cannot flow. A cup has form for the emptiness inside. Houses have four walls and a roof, but the space inside is where we live. Things seem to exist, but arise from non-existence.


up

12

If you look at bright light, you go blind. If you listen to loud noise, you go deaf. Tasting many flavours reduces the tongue's sensitivity. Many thoughts confuse the mind. Many desires break your heart. Don't crave anything. Simply fulfil your needs.


up

13

A man hopes to be successful and fears failure. Why? Because he is someone important. Neither hope nor fear can sway a master though. Why? Because a master knows he is no one important. Free from ideas of self-importance even life and death matter not. Success and failure lose all meaning. Here, how can hope and fear touch you? Seeing all things as equal you love all things as yourself.


up

14

The Tao cannot be seen, so don't look for it. You can't hear it, so don't listen for it. It is no-thing, so don't try to touch it. Timeless and dimensionless, it cannot be named. But all things are contained in it. Subtle beyond understanding. It is a beginningless and endless present. Not trying to find it, you can be it. Look, here you are!


up

15

All past masters of the Tao had deep penetration of the subtle. This subtlety cannot be understood. Therefore the masters seem mysterious. All we can describe is their manner. They took care with every action, Watched like a hawk, Respected all, Adapted to every situation; and were firm inside so their clarity was always evident. Practice stilling the mind amidst everyday life, till it clears. Remain unmoved till the movement comes of its own accord.

Don't try to fulfill the Tao, but remain empty. Only by being empty can you be filled.


up

16

Empty the mind by not thinking of gain or loss. Follow your heart in all matters and the mind isn't stirred. Even though the misery of others is apparent, you contemplate their ultimate destiny. That destiny is enlightenment. Being one with the Tao is enlightenment. Here you are serenely impartial. Being someone is a delusion. Here you are separate and confused. Impartial, you shine on existence like the sun, caring not what or who you shine on. At one with the Tao, birth and death cannot touch you.


up

17

The master of the Tao is the highest. The next is the person who causes others to love him. The next is the person who causes others to fear him. The lowest is the person who causes others to despise him. The master trusts in the Tao, therefore doesn't try to improve others. Limited in his words, he lets his actions speak loudly. Others begin following his actions and success comes naturally.


up

18

When people are separated from the Tao, they are taught to be kind and ethical. Given intellectual knowledge they lose their intelligence. They are trained to be obedient and polite to make them consistent. Only by suppressing their individuality will they serve abstract concepts, such as a country.


up

19

Ideas of holiness and wisdom will hamper your progress. Ideas of morality and justice cannot replace what is written on people's hearts. The idea of profiting off others causes thieves to appear. Since these three ideas are man made, they are not eternal. Therefore they should be avoided. Patient, compassionate, and desireless, you are in step with the Tao.


up

20

Without thinking, you cannot worry. There is nothing good or bad. You can neither succeed nor fail. The master may still think of good or bad, but he is aware that it is a thought and simply watches it pass. An ordinary man thinks of good or bad and believes it. This is the difference between enlightenment and delusion. Ordinary people try different hobbies in the pursuit of happiness. The master drifts around doing nothing in particular, indifferent like a baby before it can smile. Ordinary people have an identity. The master has none. Therefore he seems like an idiot. Ordinary people try to shine outwardly through their achievements. The master's achievements are not known by others. The intentions of ordinary people are evident. The master has no intentions. Ordinary people know what to do. The master doesn't. He drifts along like a cloud in the sky. He is different from ordinary people. He is nourished by the Tao.


up

21

The master has separated from mind, and the great virtuous Tao is. The mind is like a foot. If it follows that which is greater it is useful. If it tries to lead of its own volition it will lead to disaster. The Tao is beyond conception, so drop all ideas. If you cling to anything it cannot provide nourishment. Neither inside nor outside, the Tao is non-dual. It can only be known by not knowing.


up

22

Separate yourself and become whole. Yield and become firm. Be empty so you can be filled. Die so you can be reborn. Lose everything you have, and have it all. The master through the Tao sets and example for all. He doesn't show off so his depth is evident. Free from ambition, he can be trusted. Having lost his identity, people can identify with him. Never disagreeing, no one can disagree with him. When the ancient masters said: “Separate yourself and become whole”, they weren't doing so lightly. Trust the masters and become whole.


up

23

To be limited in speech is natural. Clouds may come, but when they pass the sun shines through. Your words may come, but when they pass there is silence. This is the natural way of the Tao. When things come, let them. When things pass, let them. Following the natural flow you will embody the Tao. Virtue can be experienced by the virtuous. Those who lose the natural way become lost. If you don't trust in your natural responses, you make yourself untrustworthy.


up

24

Strive for more, and you lose what you have. Hurry ahead and you will miss something, and then have to go back. Boast of achievements, and they will be lost. Define who you are, and you will lose your true self. Try to control others, and you will be controlled by them. These traits represent wasted energy spent on the ego. The master has long done away with them.


up

25

Before the universe was manifest a perfect emptiness abided. It is eternally still and silent, but creates infinite things. Not having a name, I call it the Tao. Being indescribable, I call it great. Infinite things constantly flow through it, never ceasing. The Tao is great, The universe is great, The earth is great, Man is great. Man must follow the natural laws of the earth, The earth must follow the natural laws of the universe, The universe must follow the natural laws of the Tao, The Tao simply is.


up

26

Something can only be heavy relative to something lighter. Movement can only occur relative to something unmoved. The master may travel all day, but remains motionless. There may be amazing sights, but he never looks. A father shouldn't act the fool, and ignore the needs of his family. If you take your responsibilities lightly, you lose the basis of your being. If you fall prey to restlessness you cannot be relaxed.


up

27

The master travels the natural path, which has no destination, and on which no tracks can be left. A good trader follows the market wherever it goes. A good teacher lets the students guide him. A master is present for all, both saints and sinners. All situations are used and nothing is dismissed. This is called spreading the light. A man, who considers himself good, must be intimate with that which is bad. A man, who considers himself bad, must know the good. Therefore the master sees no distinction between the two. For this reason the master and disciple are equal.


up

28

Know how to be assertive but remain passive. Be receptive towards all situations and you will be in accordance with them, like a little child. Understanding the conditionality of opposites, you can avoid all opposition. Never in error, you are virtuous. People are bound to follow such and example. Know the personal, but keep to the impersonal: Accept the world as it is. If you accept the world as it is you will naturally be humble. How can the impersonal be arrogant? In this way the master is like a block of wood, which can be carved into any shape.


up

29

You cannot change the world, only yourself. The world is in constant natural change, how could you add to it? If you try to change it you will ruin yourself. If you treat it like an object, you objectify yourself. Simply follow the natural flow of the changes: Sometimes lead, Sometimes follow, Sometimes move, Sometimes stop, Sometimes be active, Sometimes be at rest, Sometimes be safe, Sometimes be in danger. The master knows the world is beyond his control, so lets things come and go without interfering. He is like a blade of grass: When the wind blows it bends with it. This way he is always centered and keeps his energy.


up

30

A father who trusts in the Tao doesn't force his children to do anything, and doesn't discipline them. He knows this would be against the natural way and would damage the children as well as himself. The master knows if force is used on a child, weeds will grow in the child's mind. Achievements may be apparent, but he will not boast or take pride in them. He knows they are attributed to the Tao, and no claimant exists. From here he simply moves on. This is the natural way.


up

31

Weapons generate fear; real humans loath them. Peace is the highest value. If it has been destroyed, utmost restraint is needed to restore it. Your enemies are people as well, so any battle is entered into gravely. Do not wish them personal harm. Do not rejoice in victory. Who would rejoice in the killing of men? Conduct a war as you would a funeral, it is a time of mourning. Weep for your enemy as you would for your friend.


up

32

The Tao is not big, but it contains all. If a father could follow the Tao, the children will be naturally compliant. Everything will be in perfect accord, and life will be sweet. If you create laws, you create lawlessness. If you trust the people the law will be written on their hearts. When you name something, you create division. Institutions are created to serve a common purpose. When the purpose is served they are no longer needed. Know when to stop to avoid conflicts. Everything flows into the Tao, as all rivers flow into the ocean.


up

33

With intellect, you have knowledge of others. Enlightened there is no self. With force you can master others. By yielding you master the Tao. In striving to accumulate wealth, you become poor. In accepting what you have, you become rich. Do only what needs to be done and relax. If you accept death, you will live in eternity.


up

34

The Tao flows constantly like a river. All things arise in it, but are not separate. It brings about the natural sequence of things, but makes no effort. It nourishes the whole universe, but claims no reward. Everything relies on it, but it does not rely on anything. All things come and go, but it alone is; that is its greatness. It has no desire to be great, so its greatness is complete.


up

35

The master being at one with the Tao doesn't feel threatened when in danger. Even if surrounded by misery he is perfectly peaceful. People are excited by the sound of music or the taste of food. But they find words which try to point out the Tao flavourless. If you try to look for it, it cannot be seen. If you try to listen for it, it cannot be heard. Experience it, and it never ceases.


up

36

For something to expand, first it must shrink. To strengthen something, first it must be weakened. To raise something, first it must be lowered. To receive something, first you must give. This subtlety can be seen in all matters. The soft overcomes the hard. The subtle penetrates the obvious. Keep your inner development a secret, and the results will be clear.


up

37

The Tao never does anything, yet there is nothing it doesn't do. If a father instills this virtue into his being, the children will be transformed by themselves, in accordance with their nature. Following their nature, their contentment is total and no desires would arise. When no desire arises, bliss and tranquility abide.


up

38

The master needs no satisfaction, so his acts are always pure. An ordinary man demands satisfaction, so his acts are always tainted. The master is not a doer, so nothing is to be done. An ordinary man is a doer, so many things need doing. A man who tries to do the right thing creates more problems. A man who tries to do the moral thing will use force. If people can't act naturally, they may try to be good. If they can't be good, they may try to be moral. If they can't be moral, they may try to be fair. If they can't be fair they will conform. Conformity appears to be politeness and sincerity, but is really the realm of confusion and folly. The master dwells in the depths of reality. He considers the use of occult powers as foolishness. The miracle is the flower. The Tao is the fruit. Dwell in the fruit, for nourishment can only be found there.


up

39

The Tao is not separate from mind, body and spirit. But mind, body and spirit can separate from the Tao. A clear mind and you are as open as the sky. A healthy body and you are as vital as the earth. A free spirit and you are bound to nothing. A mind which is divided by thoughts lacks clarity. A body which indulges the senses becomes ill. A spirit which is chained to the world will break. The master serves his mind, body and spirit all they require, and asks not a thing in return. With no will of his own, the Tao leads him to an unknown destination. How could this not be the greatest journey of man?


up

40

All things return to the Tao. The Tao yields to receive them all. Everything appears to be something. Something arises out of nothing.


up

41

One, who upon hearing of the Tao is immediately transformed, is superior. One, who upon hearing of the Tao, half doubts it, is average. One, who upon hearing of the Tao laughs at it, is inferior. If fools didn't scoff at it, it wouldn't be great. Thus it is said: Light seems to arise out of darkness. To go forward appears to be going in reverse. To be simple seems complicated. Real compassion seems harsh. Real strength seems weak. The unchanged seems to change. Great love seems indifferent. The master seems like a fool. The Tao is nothing, but through it everything is.


up

42

The Tao gave birth to the universe. The universe gave birth to the earth. The earth gave birth to man. Man gave birth to everything. Everything is experience, but receives a name. There is total harmony when name and experience combine. An ordinary man seeks a name in the eyes of others, but at their expense. The master experiences for himself. A violent man will not enjoy a natural death.


up

43

The softest overcomes the hardest, by yielding. Emptiness can enter where there is no space. The value of non-action is in acting naturally. Therefore the master teaches of what is beyond words. And his acts carry no expectations.


up

44

Is fame more important than living? Is money more important than happiness? What do you consider success or failure? Fame fulfils the lives of others. Happiness cannot be bought. Living is a celebration of the way things are. Happiness is wanting no more.


up

45

Although things appear imperfect, herein lies their perfection. Fullness appears empty, herein lies its fullness. That which is straight appears bent. The wise appear foolish. The talented appear unskilled. That which is still appears to move. By not moving, the master can move into any situation.


up

46

With the Tao, everything serves a natural creative function. With man, weapons are made to destroy. Desire creates fear and violence. Without desire there is no fear. Free from fear you are eternal.


up

47

You cannot go anywhere to experience the Tao. It can only be experienced here. The more knowledge you have, the less you know. The master knows without knowledge, and sees without eyes. Without thinking of success is his eternal success.

up

48

You learn something everyday through knowledge. You unlearn something everyday experiencing the Tao. Unlearn more and more until you know. Then there is no doer, thus nothing to do. Doing nothing, let things take their natural course. Try to do something and you will miss.


up

49

The master has no fixed ideas, but accepts whatever comes his way. His is an unbending trust in existence, so he treats all the same. He trusts that a good man is doing the right thing. He also trusts that a bad man is doing the right thing. He keeps his trust a secret, knowing others cannot understand. He appears to be like a child.


up

50

Ordinary people revolve in the misery of birth and death. The master is free from birth and death. A person is not born of existence, but born of societal conditioning. Ordinary people are like water which fears the death of freezing. The master is like H2O and welcomes the movement of one state to another as the natural course of things. Because he accepts death, he is always safe. Wild beasts or weapons cannot harm him.


up

51

For every being, the Tao is. Conscious existence comes naturally. Physical appearance is determined by circumstances. Therefore, the Tao is honoured by all without effort. All are born of it, and it provides their livelihood. It is the safe haven of life and the destination of death. It produces everything, but possesses nothing. Through it all opportunities arise, but it isn't involved. Its virtue is total, and its function is mysterious.


up

52

Everything begins with the Tao and ends with the Tao. To know it retrace the steps of your life. When you reach back to the beginning, the Tao lies herein. Then you will realise there is no death. Without desire your heart is at peace. Without judgment your mind is clear. See who it is that sees. Witness thoughts come and go. Turn the light around and find its source. Practicing this leads to enlightenment.


up

53

Freedom lies in the Tao. Habits are binding. There is freedom in moderation, and bondage in excess. When the wealthy thrive at the expense of others, is this not theft? Is it not chaotic for a rich man to flaunt his money, when those around have barely enough? The violence of excess will end in disaster.


up

54

If you are rooted in the Tao, you cannot be moved. If you hold to the Tao, time won't pass. You endlessly abide in the virtue of the Tao. When your life isn?t separate from the Tao, your true self is. When your family isn't separate, they will flower. When the earth isn't separate, it is abundant. When the universe isn?t separate, it is harmonious. From an atom, to the universe, there is no inside or outside. How do I know? By hearing with my eyes.


up

55

The master's virtue is to be like a newborn child. Its connection to the physical body is weak, but its hold on the Tao is strong. Therefore it is free from all physical dangers. It hasn't been conditioned, so its energy is whole. At one with nature, it can scream all day and never becomes hoarse. If you follow the natural flow there will be no desire. Without desire there is no expectation. Without expectation there is no disappointment. Without disappointment there is serenity. In serenity abides the true breath, which is the gateway to enlightenment.


up

56

If you know, you don't talk. If you talk, you don't know. Don't speak of the Tao. Don't indulge your senses. Don't be arrogant. Drop all beliefs. Lose self-importance. Dismiss all knowledge. Here you reach non-duality. Once enlightened, you have no friends or enemies. You cannot be rewarded or punished. You cannot be honoured or disgraced. Detached from self, you can be called a real human.


up

57

To be a good father, you must follow the natural way. There can be no static ideas. The children are allowed to follow their own course. The more rules you have, the less they will obey. The more punishment you give, the less happy they will be. The more you interfere, the less self-reliant they are. Therefore a master says: I do not create rules and the children act truthfully. I do not punish, and the children are happy. I do not interfere, and the children develop naturally. If a father has no desires for his children, their fulfilment is guaranteed.


up

58

A father that is understanding and kind has children who are honest and content. A father that is strict and harsh has children who are deceitful and cunning. The higher the standard a farther expects, the lower the results for the child. Try to make a child happy and you will bring about his misery. Force morals on a child, and he will become immoral. Realise that every coin has two sides. All a father can do is set an example which he would be happy for his children to mimic.


up

59

A father who is moderate is able to be a genuine support. Because he doesn't consider himself, his acts are full of virtue. Having no vision of the future, he is totally present. Without fixed ideas, he can fit perfectly to any situation.

The master has no self, therefore knows no limits. Even death cannot stop him.


up

60

In fathering, care must be taken not to spoil a child. If you give more than is asked, this is excessive. When you follow the natural way, good or bad cannot sway you. You realise that which is considered bad, may be good, and visa versa. Dropping ideas of good or bad, your actions are natural.


up

61

A great master is prepared for nothing, so is ready for anything. He trusts in the Tao and accepts he cannot control its movement. Realising its greatness, he serves it. Thus he is humble and feminine. Humble and feminine, he allows himself to be nourished by the Tao. Being nourished by the Tao, he himself becomes great. Greatness can only be achieved through humility.

up

62

Everything springs from the Tao. It shelters both the good and the bad. Men may try to succeed through their words and actions, but they are of benefit only if they lead to the Tao. There is little value in travelling a lifetime gathering wealth. Ultimately value can only be found in the Tao. Why did the ancient masters value the Tao so highly? Because with the Tao, what you need, you get. Acting in accord with the Tao you are infallible. That is why its value is beyond measure.

up

63

Act without expecting results. Let the Tao do your work. Taste without tasting. Look at the big as small; think of the many as few. Have compassion for petty tyrants. Deal with things when they arise. Complete great works by gradually fulfilling them. To become a master of the Tao, take one step at a time. When your foothold is firm, the next step will come naturally. The master never aspires to greatness, but is immersed in every step. This is his greatness. Promises can be broken. What is easy can become difficult. The master realises he must ground his step before he can take another. For this reason, he never falls.


up

64

A tall tree requires deep roots, otherwise it will topple. If a problem is prevented, it doesn't arise. If your attainment is brittle it will easily shatter. Small things are easily lost. Don't take short cuts, but deal with everything fully before moving on. If you do this your progress will be steady. A mighty oak rises out of an acorn. A human develops out of a microscopic egg. A thousand mile journey starts with one step. These processes cannot be completed in one act. If you try to make something great happen and overlook the processes involved, you will fail. Only by letting the process play out naturally can you achieve the Tao. Therefore the master doesn't try to achieve. He simply follows the process calmly from start to finish. Death is stalking him, so he has nothing to cling to. His only desire is non-desire; his only learning is to unlearn. He shows people what they have always been. He loves nothing except the Tao. Therefore he can love everything.


up

65

A master doesn't teach, but shows his disciples that what they think they know, they don't. If a person thinks they know, they are trapped in that knowledge. Once the master shows them not-knowing, they can guide themselves. At this stage the master's task is completed. The master doesn't try to show his prowess, but lets his disciples discover theirs. Therefore his disciples never resent him and simple allow him to point out their true essence.


up

66

The ocean is the destination of all rivers. Why? Because it is placed below them. This shows the value of humility. A father, who parents his children with humility, follows them. By following them they will never feel oppressed and can develop naturally. His humility allows them to express themselves fully. He is beyond gratitude.


up

67

The Tao may appear to be idealistic, but if you can put it into practice, you realise its greatness. There are three traits which are required. 1. Compassion. 2. Patience. 3. Humility Compassionate and you can face things the way they are. Thus you can forgive yourself of any mistake. Patient and you remain unmoved until the right opportunity arises. Humble and you overcome self-importance, thus the ego. In following the Tao, these are your three most valuable treasures.


up

68

The best warrior isn't intent on killing. The best sportsman isn't concerned about winning. The best tactician enters the mind of his opponent. A true businessman works for the good of the community, not to rape them of their wealth and destroy the earth. A true leader has no agenda. Competition breeds violence. Peace can only be had by doing away with it.


up

69

There is a saying:”It is sometimes better to wait and see than to act first. It is safer to retreat a foot, than to advance and inch.”

Following this saying, energy is conserved. When the correct course of action becomes apparent, you are able to act. In trying to overcome the ego, it can't be defeated directly. Don't see it as bad, and there will be no conflict in you. If you create conflict, your three treasures will be lost, and you will become an enemy to yourself. To overcome the ego, yield to it, and simply be aware of its motivations. Once its motivations are apparent, it is discredited and will lose all power over you.


up

70

The way of the master is simple, and easy to practice. But your mind cannot understand, and you can't try to attain it. Ordinary people are interested in the mundane world, and even if they hear of the Tao they don't grasp its depth. Few and far between are those who follow the way. They realise those who don't follow, aren't ready, so don't try to persuade them. Those who become ready have to lose all hope. Once all hope is lost, there is hope.


up

71

You can only know when there is no knowing. Thinking you know is a delusion. If you realise the delusion is your own, it can be cleared. The master has rejected all knowing, and his delusion has cleared. He is now enlightened.


up

72

The master's sense of wonder is constant, like a déjà vu that never ends. He realises this wonder is missing from others, but leaves them be unless they ask for help. Having no self, he understands them. If he would push or prod, they would distance themselves. He has let go of the idea that people can be helped.


up

73

Acting passionately can lead to trouble. Being indifferent, there is no trouble. The reasons why things happen can hardly be known, so we can't know if something is good or bad. By not trying to succeed, everything is successful. Without speaking, everything is said. By not seeking, it can be found. The natural way covers everything and every event like a net. Though its meshes may be wide, nothing slips through.


up

74

Death is a natural part of life, and it is your fate. If you accept this fully, there is no fear. Having no fear, your actions are powerful. If you try to manage your life, you won't live. Because of death there is no risk, hence nothing to manage. A life based on death will be fulfilling. A life based on life will lead to death.


up

75

If you require many concessions from children, they won't be able to fulfil their own hearts. Give them many rules to follow and they will rebel. When people outwardly value life, death is taken lightly. If death is taken lightly, life will easily be sacrificed.


up

76

When a baby is born, it is soft and flexible. When a man dies he is static and stiff. A living plant bends and flowers. Dead, it is brittle and barren. Stiff and static, you are as if dead. Flexible and soft, you are a beacon of life. That which is stiff and brittle will easily snap, and be destroyed. That which is soft and flexible will bend, and endure.


up

77

The Tao functions like a bending bow. When something is gained, something else is lost. If there is excess here, there will be deficiency there. A rich man, who takes more from those who are lacking, will become deficient in the Tao. The master gives, therefore he has. He doesn't need recognition and acts with no thought of reward. With no thought of reward, everything he does is rewarding.


up

78

Water is the softest thing in the world. But in dissolving things that are hard, nothing can better it. This is because it can't be broken, thus it endures. Everybody knows the soft is stronger than the hard, and the passive overcomes the aggressive, but few put this into practice. The master is humble, therefore he is great. Because he can follow, he is able to lead. Truth is paradoxical.


up

79

Behind every failure, is a success. If you blame, you will be blamed. The master takes responsibility for himself and is not concerned with the actions of others. He expects nothing from them, and doesn't rely on them. If a mistake is made he accepts it. Through this he avoids disturbance.


up

When happy: Even if you have occult powers, they will not be used, You can achieve great works, but there is no need, You can travel far and wide, but you stay at home, You can become a great man, but you remain unknown, You can control people, but you leave them be. Joy is found in ordinary goings on. Even though you may be able to see the border to the next country, you are content to die of old age never having been there.

True words aren't beautiful. Beautiful words are not truthful. The wise do not argue. Those who argue are not wise. Those who know have no knowledge. Those with knowledge don't know. The master has nothing, but gives everything he has. The more he gives, the happier he is. Only with the Tao can you be fulfilled. The beginning doesn't exist; the end doesn't exist, except through the other. Is finishing verse eighty-one, the end, or the beginning? If you think it is the end, you need to read it again. If you think it is the beginning, you also need to read it again.
