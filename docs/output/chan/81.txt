True words are not beautiful; Beautiful words are not true.
A good man does not argue; He who argues is not a good man.
A wise man has no extensive knowledge; He who has extensive knowledge is not a wise man.
The sage does not accumulate for himself. The more he uses for others, the more he possesses of his own.
The Way of Heaven is to benefit others and not to injure. The Way of the sage is to act but not to compete.
