The strategists say: "I dare not take the offensive but I take the defensive; I dare not advance an inch but I retreat a foot."
This means: To march without formation, To stretch one's arm without showing it, To confront enemies without seeming to meet them, To hold weapons without seeming to have them.
There is no greater disaster than to make light the enemy.
Therefore when armies are mobilized and issues joined, The man who is sorry over the fact will win.
