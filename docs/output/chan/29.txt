When one desires to take over the empire and act on it (interfere with it), I see that he will not succeed.
The empire is a spiritual thing, and should not be acted on. He who acts on it harms it. He who holds on to it loses it.
Among creatures some lead and some follow. Some blow hot and some blow cold. Some are strong and some are weak. Some may break and some may fall.
Therefore the sage discards the extremes, the extravagant, and the excessive.
