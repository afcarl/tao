Act without action. Do without ado. Taste without tasting.
Whether it is big or small, many or few, repay hatred with virtue.
Prepare for the difficult while it is still easy. Deal with the big while it is still small.
Difficult undertakings have always started with what is easy. And great undertakings have always started with what is small.
Therefore the sage never strives for the great, And thereby the great is achieved.
He who makes rash promises surely lacks faith. He who takes things too easily will surely encounter much difficulty.
For this reason even the sage regards things as difficult. And therefore he encounters no difficulty.
