He who knows others is wise; He who knows himself is enlightened.
He who conquers others has physical strength. He who conquers himself is strong.
He who is contented is rich. He who acts with vigour has will.
He who does not lose his place (with Tao) will endure. He who dies but does not really perish enjoys long life.
