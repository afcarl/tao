The all-embracing quality of the great virtue follows alone from the Tao.
The thing that is called Tao is eluding and vague. Vague and eluding, there is in it the form. Eluding and vague, in it are things. Deep and obscure, in it is the essence. The essence is very real; in it are evidences.

How do I know that the beginning of all things are so? Through this (Tao).
