Abandon sageliness and discard wisdom; Then the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon humanity and discard righteousness; Then the people will return to filial piety and deep love.
Abandon skill and discard profit; Then there will be no thieves or robbers.
However, these three things are ornaments (wen) and are not adequate.
Therefore let people hold on to these: Manifest plainness, Embrace simplicity, Reduce selfishness, Have few desires.
