In ancient times those who practiced Tao well Did not seek to enlighten people, but to make them ignorant.
People are difficult to govern because they have too much knowledge. Therefore he who rules the state through knowledge is a robber of the state; He who rules a state not through knowledge is a blessing to the state.
One who knows these two things also (knows) the standard. Always to know the standard is called profound and secret virtue.
Virtue becomes deep and far-reaching, And with it all things return to their original state. Then complete harmony will be reached.
