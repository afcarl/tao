When man is born, he is tender and weak. At death he is stiff and hard.
All things, the grass as well as the trees, are tender and supple while alive. When dead, they are withered and dried.
Therefore the stiff and the hard are companions of death. The tender and the weak are companions of life.
Therefore, if the army is strong, it will not win. If a tree is stiff, it will break.
The strong and the great are inferior, while the tender and the weak are superior.
