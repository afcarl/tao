Which does one love more, fame or one's own life? Which is more valuable, one's own life or wealth? Which is worse, gain or loss?
Therefore he who has lavish desires will spend extravagantly. He who hoards will lose most heavily.
He who is contented suffers no disgrace. He who knows when to stop is free from danger. Therefore he can long endure.
