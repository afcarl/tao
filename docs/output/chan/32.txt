Tao is eternal and has no name. Though its simplicity seems insignificant, none in the world can master it.
If kings and barons would hold on to it, all things would submit to the spontaneously.
Heaven and earth unite to drip sweet dew. Without the command of men, its drips evenly over all.
As soon as there were regulations and institutions, there were names. As soon as there were names, know that it is time to stop. It is by knowing when to stop that one can be free from danger.
Analogically, Tao in the world may be compared to rivers and streams running into the sea.
