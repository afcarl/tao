Ruling a big country is like cooking a small fish.
If Tao is employed to rule the empire, Spiritual beings will lose their supernatural power.
Not that they lose their spiritual power, But their spiritual power can no longer harm people. Not only will their supernatural power not harm people, But the sage also will not harm people.
When both do not harm each other, Virtue will be accumulated in both for the benefit (of the people).
