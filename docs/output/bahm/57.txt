A good leader guides by example; A bad leader resorts to force and intrigue. Everything gains by noninterference. How do I know this?
Consider the evidence: The more restrictions and taxes there are, the poorer the people become. The more weapons people possess, the more they fight.
The more complicated machines become, the greater the danger from mechanical accident. The more laws are enacted and taxes assessed, the greater the number of law-breakers and tax-evaders.
This is why the intelligent man concludes: When I attend to my own business, other people are able to attend to theirs. When I exemplify self-reliance, other people will devote themselves to the exercise of their own intelligence.
When I make no demands upon them, other people themselves will prosper. When I express no desire to interfere in their lives, others will become genuinely self-sufficient.
