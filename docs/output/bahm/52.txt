Nature, because it has mothered all, may be regarded as Mother Nature.
He who understands Mother Nature, understands her children. But to avoid the children's mistakes, one should follow close to Mother Nature herself, If throughout his life he desires a safe guide.
If one remains silent and keeps to himself, he will not fail to fulfill his life;
But is he gives advice and meddles in others' affairs, he invites trouble.
If you see what is small as it sees itself, And accept what is weak for what strength it has, and use what is dim for the light it gives, Then all will go well.
This is called acting naturally.
