He who is intelligent is like a little child. Poisonous insects do not sting him. Ferocious beasts do not attack him. Wild birds do not claw him. His bones are soft, his muscles weak, yet is grip is strong.
Because he has no urge for sexual union, he is fully satisfied. His vitality is intact.
He can cry all day without getting hoarse. His existence is harmonious. To know such harmony is to be in accord with Nature.
To be in accord with Nature is to be achieving the goal of life. But to seek excitement is to invite calamity. Those too eager for activity soon become fatigued.
For when things exhaust their vigour, they age quickly. Such impatience is against Nature. What is against Nature dies young.
