Whenever someone sets out to remold the world, experience teaches that he is bound to fail.
For Nature is already as good as it can be. It cannot be improved upon. He who tries to redesign it, spoils it. He who tries to redirect it, misleads it.
Consider how Natures operates: Some things precede while others follow. Some things blow one way while some blow another. Some things are strong while others are weak. Some things are going up while others are going down.
Therefore the intelligent man avoids both extremes, shunning excess in one way as well as in the other.
