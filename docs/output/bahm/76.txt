At birth a man is soft and weak - yet capable of living the whole life ahead of him. At death he is hard and tough - yet unable to live for even a minute longer.
All things, whether plants of animals, while living, are soft and weak, But, when dead, are hard and tough.
Thus hardness and toughness are allied with death, While softness and weakness are interrelated with life.
This is the reason why the tougher fighters are more likely to be killed, and the harder trees more likely to be cut down.
Therefore it is better to be soft and weak than to be hard and tough.
