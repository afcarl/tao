The intelligent man is not willful. He accepts what others will for themselves as his will for them.
Those who appear as good, he accepts, And those who appear as bad, he accepts; For Nature accepts both.
Those who appear faithful, he accepts, And those who appear unfaithful, he accepts; For Nature accepts both.
The intelligent man treats every kind of nature impartially, And will good to one as much as the another. All people admire the intelligent man, Because he regards them all as a mother regards her children.
