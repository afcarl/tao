Ultimate reality is all-pervasive; it is immanent everywhere.
All other things owe their existence to it and draw their sustenance from it, without anyone being refused. Having created and and nurtured them, it does not demand title to them. Even though it has provided for all, it refuses to dominate over a single one.
Since it asks nothing in return for its services, it may appear as of little worth.
But all things return home to it again, even though they do not know that they are being called home. Therefore it may be thought of as ultimate.
Since it never claims ultimacy for itself, it is, by that very fact, ultimate indeed.
