Let us be intelligent and follow Nature itself. Let us not stray.
Nature's way is simple and easy, but men prefer the intricate and artificial.
When they congregate in artistically engineered cities, and neglect their farms, their food supply is cut off.
When they bedeck themselves with ornaments and weapons, and display their fancy foods and rich properties, they thereby invite thievery. This is acting unnaturally.
