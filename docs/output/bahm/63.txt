Act disinterestedly - without intending that your action shall change the course of Nature. Behave indifferently - without trying to impose your own ideas upon the lives of others. Appreciate natural flavours - without adulterating natural foods with artificial flavours.
Accept the fact that what is small grows big, and what are few become many. Respond intelligently even to unintelligent treatment.
Take care of what is difficult while it is still easy, and deal with what will become big while it is yet small; For all difficult things originate in what is easy.
The most difficult things in the world Must be accomplished through the easiest. The greatest things in the world Must be accomplished through the smallest.
Therefore the intelligent man, although never troubling himself with big things, still accomplishes the same result (by dealing with them when they are small)
He who is careless about things when they are easy will have to face them when they become difficult.
Therefore the intelligent man, although dealing with things which will become difficult, does so by attending to them while they are not difficult.
