Saneness or sobriety is more basic than frivolity. Calmness or self-sufficiency is superior to being agitated.
Therefore the intelligent man, though he goes on a long journey, will never depart far from his means of conveyance. No matter how exciting the distractions, he never submits to their lures.
What would happen if Nature were to act frivolously?
If it became frivolous, it would be deprived of its sanity. If it became agitated, it would lose control of itself.
