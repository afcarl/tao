Whether governing a big country or cooking a little fish, follow Nature's way and no evil tendencies will get control.
This does not mean that the dangers of evils can be eliminated entirely, but only that they will cease to harm men.
When ordinary men are unharmed, their leaders are unharmed.
And when nobody harms anybody, perfect harmony prevails.
