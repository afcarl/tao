Do not be irritated when people do not recognize your importance; For if you are really important, sooner or later circumstances will force them to recognize it.
Do not treat them contemptuously nor despise them; For only when you do not despise them will they not despise you.
Although the intelligent man knows his own importance, He does not require that others recognize it; and he esteems himself for what he is, But does not insist that others esteem him. He does not seek to be esteemed by others because he recognizes his self-esteem as sufficicent.
