One who tries to stand on tiptoe cannot stand still. One who stretches his legs too far cannot walk.
One who advertises himself to much is ignored. One who is too insistent on his own views finds few to agree with him.
One who claims too much credit does not get even what he deserves. One who is too proud is soon humiliated.
These, when judged by the standards of Nature, are condemned as "Extremes of greediness and self-destructive activity." Therefore, one who acts naturally avoids such extremes.
