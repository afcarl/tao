Nature is always indeterminable. Although, in its original simplicity, it may appear to be helpless, no one else can tell it what to do.
If legislators and administrators could keep this in mind, everybody would obey their laws without enforcement.
When opposites supplement each other, everything is harmonious. Without compulsion, each supports the other.
But when boundaries between opposites appear, then the boundary lines are marked out. Once one begins to differentiate between one thing and another, how will we know where to stop? To know when to stop making distinctions is to be free from error.
The true relationship of every determinate thing to Nature is reintegrative, like all the rivers and rivulets ever running to their ocean.
