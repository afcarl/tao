Make agreements and then quarrelling when they are broken is never advisable. For even when a quarrel is patched up, some animosity will remain. How can this be considered good?
Therefore the intelligent man continues to carry out his side of a bargain Even though he does not demand of others that they fulfill their promises
The righteous insist on keeping agreements to the letter, And the indiscreet foolishly neglect or break their agreements;
But Nature neither keeps nor breaks contracts (because it makes none). And its ways are good for men.
