Since what is ultimate in Nature cannot be seen with one's eyes, it is spoken of as invisible. Since it cannot be heard with one's ears, it is called inaudible. Since it cannot be grasped in one's hands, it is thought of as intangible
But not even all these three together can adequately describe it. Nature did not originate in beginnings, and will not reach its goal in endings. Rather it acts unceasingly, without either absolute beginnings or final endings. If we cannot describe it intelligibly, this is because it is beyond our understanding.
Nature is the formless source of all forms, and yet it remains unaffected by its forms. Thus it appears to us as if mysterious.
No matter how closely we scrutinize its coming toward us, we cannot discover a beginning. No matter how long we pursue it, we never find its end.
One must comprehend the way in which the original Nature itself operates, if he wishes to control present conditions. That is, he should study the ultimate source itself. This is the way to understand how Nature behaves.
