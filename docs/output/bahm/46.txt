There is no greater evil than desiring to change others - (to take from or give to others what they do not, of their own accord, want to give or take). There is no greater misfortune than desiring to change oneself - being discontented with one's lot. There is no greater vice than desiring to change things - (to possess, control, or reconstruct their natures).
Only he who is satisfied with whatever satisfactions his own nature provides for him is truly satisfied.
