He who knows how to be aggressive, and yet remains patient, becomes a receptacle for all Nature's lessons. Being thus receptive, he continually reembodies intelligence, and recuperates his primal nature.
He who knows how to be brilliant, and yet remains demure, becomes the ideal which all things have as their ultimate goal. Being thus the ideal, he actualizes the unending goal of existence, and reinstates his primordial condition of perfect self sufficiency.
He who know how to be proud, and yet remains humble, becomes the recipient of all Nature's bounties. Being thus receptive, he reintegrates intrinsic goodness, and restores primitive wholeness.
Intrinsic goodness, when devoted to varieties of uses, functions as instrumental value. When the intelligent man employs instrumental values, he treats them as means to ends, For he is concerned with the ultimate ends, never mistaking the means as ends in themselves.
