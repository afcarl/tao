He who is genuine is not artificial; He who is artificial is not genuine.
He who is intelligent is not quarrelsome; He who is quarrelsome is not intelligent.
He who is wise is not pretentious; He who is pretentious is not wise.
Therefore the intelligent man does not struggle to achieve for himself. The more useful he is to others, the more his needs will be cared for by those repeatedly benefited by his yielding.
Nature's way is to produce good without evil. The intelligent man's way is to accept and follow Nature rather than to oppose Nature.
