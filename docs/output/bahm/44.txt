Esteem by others or self-esteem, which is better? To value things or to value yourself, which is better? To have more or to have less, which is worse?
The more you have, the more you have to lose. The more you value things, the less you value your self. The more you depend on others for esteem, the less you are self-sufficient.
He who knows how to discriminate wisely avoids danger, And continues safely on his way.
