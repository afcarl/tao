The ideal state is a small intimate community Where all the necessities of life are present in abundance. There everyone is satisfied to live and die without looking around for greener pastures.
Even if they have cars or boats, they do not use them for travelling abroad. Even if they have police and fortifications, these are never put to use.
Business transactions are simple enough to be calculated on one's fingers rather than requiring complicated bookkeeping. The people are satisfied with their food, Contented with their clothing, Comfortable in their dwellings, And happy with their customs.
Even though neighbouring communities are within sight, And the crowing of the neighbour's cocks and barking of the neighbour's dogs are within hearing, They grow old and die without ever troubling themselves to go outside of their own communities.
