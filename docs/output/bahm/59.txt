In managing men or anything else, the intelligent man uses self-restraint. Only by self-restraint can one forestall trouble.
Forestalling trouble strengthens one's position. Such strengthened position enables one to withstand everything. Withstanding everything, one remains unchallenged.
Being unchallenged, one governs easily. Because he embodies Mother Nature within himself, he retains a sound position.
This is the way to be deeply rooted and firmly based, And durable and long-lived.
