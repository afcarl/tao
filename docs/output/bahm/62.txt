Nature is profoundly worth while. It is that which is most worth while for good men, And it is the only real value for bad men.
Flattery may gain favours, and gifts may help one to advance, But bad men know how to flatter and bribe.
Therefore when leaders are installed in office, Better than he who artfully gives lavish gifts and glowing tribute, Is one who, by doing nothing but accepting his natural role as a follower, pays genuine homage.
Why have men always valued Nature? Was it not because Nature submitted humbly to the task of benefiting the good and the bad alike? Is this not the reason why it is the most worth while thing in the world?
