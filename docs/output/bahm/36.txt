The purpose of contracting (returning to Nature) is served by expanding (emerging out of Nature in the first place). The purpose of weakening (subsiding or satisfying of desire) is served by strengthening (arousing the will to live). The purpose of decline (of individual self-assertion) is served by arising (of individuality). The purpose of taking away (culminating or perfecting life) is served by being given (ie., "the last of life for which the first was made").
This is the most penetrating insight into the way of life. The giving in or finishing always triumphs over the starting out.
Just as a fish should not be taken out of water, So a sword should never be taken from its scabbard.
