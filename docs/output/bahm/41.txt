When the intelligent man hears about Nature's alternating ways, he seeks to embody it within himself. The mediocre man sometimes accepts it and sometimes does not.
Unintelligent men scoff at it. Yet this very scoffing at intelligence itself exemplifies Nature's way of alternation.
This is the reason for the old sayings: Nature's brightest day fades into night. Nature's most luxuriant growth ages toward decay. Nature's smoothest plain erodes itself away into rough terrain.
Nature's most harmonious adjustment generates conflict. Nature's most beautiful objects grow dim and ugly. Nature's greatest prize soon becomes despised. Nature's strongest power eventually weakens. Nature's soundest supports gradually rot away. Nature's squarest corners soon become rounded. Nature's grandest structures sooner or later are destroyed. Nature's loudest sounds are finally silenced.
Hence, Nature, although beyond comprehension and description, Knows how to bring about, alternately, all initiating and completing.
