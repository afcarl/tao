To be great, a state must be passively receptive, like the ocean which accepts whatever the rivers bring into it, or like the feminine which always submits to the masculine. Recall how the female always overcomes the male by means of her passivity. Passivity is submissiveness.
Thus the great state places itself at the service of a small state before before it absorbs the small state. And a small state must serve the interests of the great state before it can be taken into the great state.
Hence, some submit in order to take, while others submit in order to be taken.
When a great state desires to have more people, and a small state desires to be protected,
it is by submission that both obtain what they desire.
