It is natural for man to be born and to die. And it is natural for each of his parts to be born and to die and to evolve through its life cycle.
Why do men become so perturbed and anxious to prolong the life of each part when endangered? The truth is that whatever is natural is good.
Since it is natural for man to dies anyway, being assisted by horn or claw or spear in bringing about his death in no way endangers his nature.
No wild buffalo horn can change the course of Nature. No tiger's claw can act unnaturally. No soldier's spear can go against Nature. Why? Because death is natural, but Nature cannot die.
