Military maxims say: "It is easier to defend than to attack." "It is better to back away a foot than to assault to gain an inch."
This means that the best way to advance is to retreat. He who bares his flesh will appear to have no need for carrying weapons. He who does not flourish weapons appears to have nothing to defend. He who does not prepare to defend himself appears to have no enemies.
No one will attack a person unless he appears to be an enemy, For to attack one who is not an enemy is to lose a friend.
Therefore, when opposing enemies meet for open battle, he who runs away to hide is the one who wins.
