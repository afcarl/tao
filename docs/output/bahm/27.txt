The wise traveler has no need to retrace his steps. The effective speaker does not need to repeat himself. The generous trader needs no scales.
The self-closing door needs no bolt, for it will not open itself even though it is not forced to stay shut. Things which go together naturally do not have to be tied; for they will not separate even without bonds.
Therefore the intelligent man expresses his beneficence to other men by accepting each man's own way as best for himself. And he performs the same service for all other beings, for he willingly recognizes that, by following its own nature, each thing does the best that can be done for it.
This may be called the two-pronged lesson: Bad men can learn from the good man's successes. Good men can learn from the bad man's failures.
Whoever despises such teachers, whether good or bad, or who fails to appreciate such lessons, Even though he may be a "walking encyclopedia," is really a misguided fool. This is the secret of wisdom.
