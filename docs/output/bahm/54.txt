What is deeply rooted in Nature cannot be uprooted. He who embraces Nature's way as his own will not easily go astray; And his children and grandchildren will continue to emulate him.
If one embodies Nature's way in his own life, he will be genuinely intelligent. If he establishes it in his family, his home life will be felicitous. If he cultivates it in he community, his future will be prosperous. If he fosters it in his state, his future will be auspicious. If he inspires in in the whole country, his benefit will become universal. Thus one's own individual life serves as an example for other individuals.
One's family life serves as an example for other individuals. One's family life serves as a model for other families. One's community serves as a standard for other communities. One's state serves as an ideal for other states.
How do I know all this? It is obvious.
