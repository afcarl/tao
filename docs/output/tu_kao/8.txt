The highest goodness is like water. Water is beneficent to all things but does not contend. It stays in places which others despise. Therefore it is near Tao.
In dwelling, think it a good place to live; In feeling, make the heart deep; In friendship, keep on good terms with men; In words, have confidence;
In ruling, abide by good order; In business, take things easy; In motion, make use of the opportunity.
Since there is no contention, there is no blame.
