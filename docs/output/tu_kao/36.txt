In order to contract a thing, one should surely expand it first. In order to weaken, one will surely strengthen first. In order to overthrow, one will surely exalt first. 'In order to take, one will surely give first'!
This is called subtle wisdom. The soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong.
As the fish should not leave the deep So should the sharp implements of a nation not be shown to anyone!
