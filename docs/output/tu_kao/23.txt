To be sparing of words is natural. A violent wind cannot last a whole morning; pelting rain cannot last a whole day.
Who have made these things but heaven and earth? Inasmuch as heaven and earth cannot last forever, how can man?
He who engages himself in Tao is identified with Tao. He who engages himself in virtue is identified with virtue. He who engages himself in abandonment is identified with abandonment.
Identified with Tao he will be well received by Tao. Identified with virtue he will be well received by virtue. Identified with abandonment he will be well received by abandonment.
