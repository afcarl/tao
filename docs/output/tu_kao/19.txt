Do away with sageness and eject wisdom, and the people will be more benefited a hundred times.
Do away with learning, and grief will not be known. Do away with benevolence and eject righteousness, and the people will return to filial duty and parental love.
Do away with artifice and eject gains, and there will be no robbers and thieves.
These four, if we consider them as culture, are not sufficient.
Therefore let there be what the people can resort to: Appear in plainness and hold to simplicity; Restrain selfishness and curtail desires.
