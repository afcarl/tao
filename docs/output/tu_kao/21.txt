The great virtue as manifested is but following Tao.
Tao is a thing that is both invisible and intangible. Intangible and invisible, yet there are forms in it; Invisible and intangible, yet there is substance in it; Subtle and obscure, there is essence in it; This essence being invariably true, there is faith in it.
From of old till now, it has never lost its (nameless) name, Through which the origin of all things has passed.
How do I know that it is so with the origin of all things? By this (Tao).
