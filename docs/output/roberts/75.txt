The people lack for food
When those above them overtax;
That is why they lack.
And the people can’t be ruled
When those above them serve themselves.
That is why they can’t be ruled.
And when the people death defy
It is but to make their lives secure –
That is why.
Worthier far than living royally
Those who live not for themselves.
