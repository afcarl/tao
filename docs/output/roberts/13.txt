“At favour (as disgrace) take fright:
Honours to the self bring woe.”
“Explain ‘At favour (as disgrace) take fright.’”
“What could be more dire than favour?
Its gain – or loss – betokens danger.
Such is the meaning.”
“Explain ‘Honours to the self bring woe.’”
“our selves are why we suffer harm;
Without them what harm would there be?
So to the one
Who honours self above the world
Confide its care;
To the one
Who holds the self more dear than it
Entrust its care.”
