The Way as “way” bespeaks no common lasting Way,
The name as ‘name’ no common lasting name.
Absent is the name for shy and land’s first life,
Present for the mother of all ten thousand things.
Desire ever absent:
Behold the seed germs of all things;
Desire ever present:
Behold their every finite course.
Forth together come the two
As one and the same
But differ in name.
As one, a dark recess
That probed recedes
Past that portal whence
The milling seed germs teem.
