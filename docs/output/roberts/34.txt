The Way moves like the turning tide,
Leftward, rightward, lending its aid.
Ten thousand on the Way depend;
By it they live; the Way, never shirking,
Attain success, fulfills its tasks,
Without its ever being named.
Under its mantle all beings thrive;
But ruling them not, not desiring aught,
The Way wins the name of humble and low.
All beings bend to that home of no known master,
And thus the Way wins the name supreme.
And so may the wise achieve this themselves:
To shun self-supremacy all of their days
Is the way they achieve things supreme.
