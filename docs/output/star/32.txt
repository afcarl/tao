Tao is eternal, one without a second
Simple indeed yet so subtle that no one can master it
If princes and kings could jus hold it
All things would flock to their kingdom
Heaven and Earth would rejoice with the dripping of sweet dew
Everyone would live in harmony, not by official decree, but by their own inner goodness
This world is nothing but the glory of Tao expressed through different names and forms
One who sees the things of this world as being real and self-existent has lost sight of the truth
To him, every word becomes a trap every thing becomes a prison
One who knows the truth that underlies all things lives in this world without danger
To him, every word reflects the universe every moment brings enlightenment
Rivers and streams are born of the ocean
All creation is born of Tao
Just as all water flows back to become the ocean
All creation flows back to become Tao
