From ancient times till now the One has been the source of all attainments
By realizing One Heaven becomes clear, Earth becomes still spirits gain power and hearts fill up with joy
By realizing the One kings and lords become instruments of peace and creatures live joyfully upon this earth
Without the One Heaven ahs no clarity and would crack Earth has no peace and would crumble spirits have no power and would lose their charm
Without the One hearts would dry up, empires would fall, all things would go lifelessly upon this earth
Long ago kings and lords called themselves “orphaned,” “lonely,” and “unworthy”
What honour can there be without humility?
What heights can be reached without being low?
The pieces of a chariot are useless unless they work in accordance with the whole
A man’s life brings nothing unless he lives in accordance with the whole universe
Playing one’s part in accordance with the universe is true humility
So whether you’re a gem in the royal court or a stone on the common path
If you accept your part with humility the glory of the universe will be yours
