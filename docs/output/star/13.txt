“Be wary of both honour and disgrace”
“Endless affliction is bound to the body”
What does it mean, “Be wary of both honour and disgrace?”
Honour is founded on disgrace and disgrace is rooted in honour
Both should be avoided
Both bind a man to this world
That’s why it says, “Be wary of both honour and disgrace”
What does it mean, “Endless affliction is bound to the body?”
Man’s true self is eternal, yet he thinks, “I am this body, I will soon die”
This false sense of self is the cause of all his sorrow
When a person does not identify himself with the body tell me, what troubles could touch him?
One who sees himself as everything is fit to be guardian of the world
One who loves himself as everyone is fit to be teacher of the world.
