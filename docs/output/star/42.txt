The one gives life to the two
The two gives life to the three
The three give life to ten thousand things

Yet this is the very way that kings and lords once described themselves
Who knows what fate may bring – one day your loss may be your fortune one day your fortune may be your loss
The age-old lesson that others teach, I also teach – “As you plant, so you reap” “As you live, so you die”
Know this to be the foundation of my teachings
