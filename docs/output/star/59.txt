Rule the people and serve Heaven yet hold nothing more dear than the Mother’s harvest
Let every thought and every breath be the fruit of your offering –
Do it now
Let her power run thick in your blood
There will be no obstacle you cannot overcome
No limit you cannot surpass
No empire you cannot rule
Ah, but in all your glory never lose sight of the Mother
Without her your empire will crumble your power will waste away
For the Mother brings the harvest
She alone causes all things to endure
We call this “Deep roots and a solid trunk” “The way of long life and lasting insight”
