The five colours blind the eye
The five tones deafen the ear
The five flavours dull the palate
Racing, hunting, and galloping about only disturb the mind
Wasting energy to obtain rare objects only impedes oneâ€™s growth
So the Sage is led by his inner truth not his outer eye
He holds to what is deep and not what lies on the surface
