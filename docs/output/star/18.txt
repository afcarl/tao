When the greatness of Tao is present action arises from one’s own heart
When the greatness of Tao is absent action comes from the rules of “kindness” and “justice”
If you need rules to be kind and just, if you act virtuous, this is a sure sign that virtue is absent
Thus we see the great hypocrisy
Only when the family loses its harmony do we hear of “dutiful sons”
Only when the state is in chaos do we hear of “loyal ministers”
