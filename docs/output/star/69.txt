The great warriors have a saying, “I dare not act as host but would rather be a guest I dare not advance an inch but would rather retreat a foot”
So advance but do not use your feet
Seize but do not use your arms
Cut but do not use your sword
Fight but do not use your own power
There is no greater misfortune than feeling “I have an enemy”
For when “I” and “enemy” exist together there is no room left for my treasure
Thus, when two opponents meet the one without an enemy will surely triumph
