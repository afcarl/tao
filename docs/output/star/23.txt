Speak little
Hold to your own nature
A strong wind does not blow all morning
A cloudburst does not last all day
The wind and the rain are form Heaven and Earth and even these do not last long
How much less so the efforts of man?
One who lives in accordance with the Truth becomes an embodiment of Tao
His actions become those of Nature his ways those of Heaven
It is through such a one that Heaven rejoices that Earth rejoices that all of life rejoices
