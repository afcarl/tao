Even the finest warrior is defeated when he goes against natural law
By his own hand he is doomed and all creatures are likely to despise him
One who knows Tao never turns from lifeâ€™s calling
When at home he honours the side of rest
When at war he honours the side of action
Peace and tranquility are what he holds most dear so he does not obtain weapons
But when their use is unavoidable he employs them with fortitude and zeal
Do not flaunt your excellence
Do not rejoice over victory
With the loss of others weep with sorrow and grief
After winning a battle, do not celebrate, observe the rites of a funeral
One who is bound to action, proud of victory, and delights in the misfortune of others
will never gain a thing from this world below Heaven
