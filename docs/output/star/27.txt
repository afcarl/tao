A knower of the Truth travels without leaving a trace speaks without causing harm gives without keeping an account
The doors he shuts, though having no lock, cannot be opened
The know he ties, though using no cord, cannot be undone
The Sage is always on the side of virtue so everyone around him prospers
He is always on the side of truth so everything around him is fulfilled
The path of the Sage is called “The Path of Illumination”
He who gives himself to this path is like a block of wood that gives itself to the chisel –
Cut by cut it is honed to perfection
Only a student who gives himself can receive the master’s gift
If you think otherwise, despite your knowledge, you have blundered
Giving and receiving are one
This is called, “The great wonder” “The essential mystery” “The very heart of all that is true”
