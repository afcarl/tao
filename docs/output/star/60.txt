Govern the nation as you would fry a small fish
When Tao is present in the empire dark spirits lose their power
It’s not that they have no power it’s that their power can’t harm anyone
When Tao is present the people enjoy the blessing of Heaven
They find unity
They find peace
What’s this about spirits doing harm?
The Sage is approaching and they are rushing in to sweep his path!
