On his tiptoes a man is not steady
Taking long strides he cannot keep pace
To the self-serving, nothing shines forth
To the self-promoting, nothing is distinguished
To the self-appointing, nothing bears fruit
To the self-righteous, nothing endures

Things that all creatures despise
So why hold onto them?
When walking the paths of Tao this is the very stuff that must be uprooted, thrown out, and left behind
