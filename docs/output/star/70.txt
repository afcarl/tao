My teachings are very easy to understand and very easy to practice
Yet so few in this world understand and so few are able to practice
My words arise from that ancient source
My actions are those of the universe itself
If people do not know these how can they know me?
Those who follow my ways are rare and so I treasure them
Even if they wear the clothes of a beggar they carry a priceless gem within
