One who speaks does not know
One who knows does not speak
Shut the mouth
Close the gates
Blunt the sharpness
Loosen the knots
Tempe the glare
Become one with the dust of the world
This is called “The Secret Embrace”
One who knows this secret is not moved by attachment or aversion, swayed by profit or loss, nor touched by honour or disgrace
He is far beyond the cares of men yet comes to hold the dearest place in their hearts
