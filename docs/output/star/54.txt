The truth, once established, can never be uprooted
The truth, once imbibed, can never be stripped away
A sacrifice to a higher cause is never lost
An offering to an ancestor never goes to waste
When a person embodies Tao his heart becomes true
When a family embodies Tao it thrives
When a village embodies Tao it is protected
When a country embodies Tao it prospers
When the world embodies Tao it reveals its perfection
Tao is everywhere it has become everything
To truly see it, one must see it as it has revealed itself
In a person, see is as a person
In a family, see is as a family
In a country, see is as a country
In the world, see is as the world
How have I come to know all this?
Tao has shown me â€“ Tao as all this!
