One’s own reputation – why the fuss?
One’s own wealth – why the concern?
I say, what you gain is more trouble than what you lose
Love is the fruit of sacrifice
Wealth is the fruit of generosity
Be content, rest in your own fullness –
You will not suffer from loss
You’ll avoid the snare of this world
You’ll have long life and endless blessings
