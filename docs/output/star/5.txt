Heaven and Earth have no permanence
A man may choose one over another but to Heaven and Earth all are the same
The high, the low, the great, the small â€“ all are given light all get a place to rest
The Sage is like Heaven and Earth
To him none are especially dear or is there anyone he disfavours
He gives and gives without condition offering his treasure to everyone
The universe is like a bellows
It stays empty yet is never exhausted
It gives out yet always brings forth more
Man is not like this
When he blows out air like a bellows he becomes exhausted
Man was not made to blow out air
He was made to sit quietly and find the truth within
