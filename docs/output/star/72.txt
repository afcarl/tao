When the people do not fear worldly power a greater power will arrive
Don’t limit the view of yourself
Don’t despise the conditions of your birth
Don’t resist the natural course of your life
In this way you will never weary of this world
The Sage knows himself, but not as himself he loves himself, but not as himself he honours himself, but not as himself
Thus, he discards the view of his own self and chooses the view of the universe
