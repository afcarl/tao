To know Tao alone, without trace of your own existence, is the highest
Next comes loving and praising it
Then fearing it
Then despising it
If one doesn’t trust himself how can he trust anyone else?
The great ruler speaks little and his words are priceless
He works without self-interest and leaves no trace
When all is finished, the people say, “It happened by itself”
