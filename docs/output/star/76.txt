When life begins we are tender and weal
When life ends we are stiff and rigid
All things, including the grass and trees, are soft and pliable in life dry and brittle in death
So the soft and supple are the companions of life
While the stiff and unyielding are the companions of death
An army that cannot yield will be defeated
A treee that cannot bend will crack in the wind
Thus by Natureâ€™s own decree the hard and strong are defeated while the soft and gentle are triumphant
