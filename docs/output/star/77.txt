Heaven operates like the bending of a bow - the high it pulls down the low it brings up
It takes from that which has too much
And gives to that which has too little
The way of man is otherwise - he takes from that which is depleted and gives to that which has too much
Who can offer an abundance to the world? â€“
One who has Tao
Such a one can give like the heavens
The Sage gives without relying on his own effort
He completes without waiting for a reward
He illumines wihtout stepping from the shadow
