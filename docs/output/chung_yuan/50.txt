To live or to die:
Three out of ten men live,
While three out of ten men die.
Further, three out of ten men cling to life,
But they lose it.
Why?
Because they all crave life.
He who knows how to safeguard his life
Does not encounter tigers or rhinoceroses.
In the battlefield
He does not avoid dangerous weapons.
Rhinoceroses cannot gore him,
Tigers cannot claw him,
Dangerous weapons cannot harm him.
Why?
Because there is no place in him for death.
