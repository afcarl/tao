Tao is concealed in the depths of all things.
The worthy value it.
The unworthy are protected by it.
Good words may be traded for honor.
Good works may impress men.
Even if a man is unworthy, Tao will never exclude him.
Although in a great nation an emperor is established,
Ministers are appointed, and
Jade and horses are all decorated,
None of these is a better offer to the nation than Tao.
Tao has been highly esteemed since the remote past.
Why?
Because not searching for it, one obtains it.
Even if one has faults, one is free from them.
Thus, the Tao is the most highly esteemed thing in the universe.
