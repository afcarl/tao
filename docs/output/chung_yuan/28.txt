To be aware of the positive, yet to abide in the negative is to be the abyss of the universe.
To be the abyss of the universe is to not deviate from real attainment and to remain like an innocent child.
To be aware of the white, yet to abide in the black is to be the chasm of the universe.
To be the chasm of the universe is to have sufficient real attainment, and to remain in the state of original non-differentiation.
When original non-differentiation is differentiated, things are produced.
Yet when the wise makes use of original non-differentiation, he becomes the leader of the people.
Therefore, great governing is non-discriminating.
