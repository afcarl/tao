In the remote past, the man who was good in Tao did not lead his people to calculative thinking,
But let them remain ignorant of it.
The difficulty in cultivating men is that they are full of intellectual discrimination.
Governing the nation through intellectual discrimination is harmful to it.
Not governing the nation through intellectual discrimination is a blessing to it.
Knowing the difference between these two sets a standard.
To be aware of this standard is profound attainment.
Profound attainment is deep and far-reaching.
It is the reversal of ordinary things, yet it leads to great harmony with Tao.
