In the remote past there were those who attained the One.
Attaining the One, heaven became pure.
Attaining the One, earth became peaceful.
Attaining the One, God became spiritual.
Attaining the One, the ocean became full.
Attaining the One, ten thousand things came into life.
Attaining the One, rulers became the models of the world.
All of them became so through the One.
Without becoming pure, heaven would have broken.
Without becoming peaceful, the earth would have quaked.
Without becoming spiritual, God would have crumbled.
Without becoming full, the ocean would have drained.
Without coming into life, ten thousand things would have perished.
Without becoming the models of the world, rulers would have stumbled.
Therefore, the worthless serves as the foundation of the worthy.
The inferior serves as the basis of the superior.
Thus, rulers call themselves isolated men, without merit, and worthless.
Is this not enough to prove that the worthless serve as the foundation of the worthy?
Hence, the perfect fame is no fame.
Rulers do not want to be esteemed as tingling jade; they would rather be plain, solid rock.
