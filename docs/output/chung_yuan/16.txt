Contemplate the ultimate void.
Remain truly in quiescence.
All things are together in action,
But I look into their non-action.
Things are unceasingly moving and restless,
Yet each one is proceeding back to the origin.
Proceeding back to the origin is quiescence.
To be in quiescence is to return to the destiny of being.
The destiny of being is reality.
To understand reality is to be enlightened.
Not to understand it, and to act wrongly, leads to disaster.
Reality is all-embracing.
To be all-embracing is to be selfless.
To be selfless is to be all-pervading.
To be all-pervading is to be transcendent.
To be transcendent is to attain Tao.
To attain Tao is to be everlasting.
Even when the body dies, it is not the end.
