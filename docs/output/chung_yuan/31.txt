Arms are implements of ill omen which are abhorred by men.
Therefore, the man of Tao does not abide them.
Arms are implements of ill omen.
One uses them only when one cannot avoid it.
Even if one engages in fighting, one should remain quiescent and indifferent.
Even if the war is won, one should not glorify it.
To glorify it means that one enjoys slaying men.
If one enjoys slaying men, one will never be successful in the world.
