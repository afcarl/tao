When a man of superior talent listens to Tao, he earnestly applies it.
When an ordinary man listens to Tao, he seems to believe it and yet not to believe it.
When the worst man listens to Tao, he greatly ridicules it.
If he did not ridicule it, it would not be Tao.
Therefore, in Ch'ien-yen we have:
Understand Tao as if you do not understand it;
Enter into Tao as if you are coming out of it;
Move smoothly with Tao as if you are having difficulties.
The highest attainment is as if it is no attainment.
All-embracing attainment is as if it is lacking attainment.
Rigorous attainment is as if it is indolent loafing.
Real essence is as if it is empty.
The great white is as if it is black.
The great square is without corners.
Great capacity is successful in its later days.
Great music is without sound.
The great image is without form.
Tao is concealed and without name.
Nevertheless, Tao furnishes all things and fulfills them.
