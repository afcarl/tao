Nature rarely expresses itself in words.
When a hurricane occurs, it does not last all morning.
Neither does a heavy shower last the whole day.
These are actions of heaven and earth.
Thus, even heaven and earth cannot maintain their actions for long.
How can man?
Therefore, the learner of Tao identifies with Tao.
When one achieves it, one identifies with one's achievement.
When one loses it, one identifies with one's losing.
When man identifies with achievement, achievement also willingly identifies with man.
When man identifies with losing, losing willingly identifies with man.
If one does not believe enough in this identity, then it will not take place.
