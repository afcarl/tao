Nothing can be taken away if it is well-founded.
Nothing can be lost if it is well-grasped.
For generations to come, the worship will not be discontinued.
To cultivate (Tao) in one's self makes attainment real.
To cultivate (Tao) in one's family makes attainment a surplus.
To cultivate (Tao) in one's community makes attainment long-lasting.
To cultivate (Tao) in one's nation makes attainment abundant.
To cultivate (Tao) in one's world makes attainment all-embracing.
Thus, through the self, one contemplates the self.
Through the family, one contemplates the family.
Through the community, one contemplates the community.
Through the nation, one contemplates the nation.
Through the world, one contemplates the world.
How do I know the world as world?
It is through this.
