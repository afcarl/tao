When one maintains the great image in dealing with the world,
One deals with the world without harming it.
Instead, one makes the world serene, tranquil, and peaceful.
Music and delicacies may attract passersby to remain momentarily,
But the taste of Tao is plain and without flavor.
Look at it, nothing can be seen.
Listen to it, nothing can he heard.
Employ it, it cannot be depleted.
