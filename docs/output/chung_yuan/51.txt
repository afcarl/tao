Tao creates all things;
Tê cultivates them.
Things are shaped according to their natures;
Relational conditions fulfill them.
Therefore, ten thousand things all venerate the source of Tao
And value the potentialities of Tê.
Tao is venerated and Tê is valued spontaneously;
No one orders that it be so.
Thus, Tao creates all things;
Tê cultivates them.
They give them birth.
They nourish them.
They give them shape.
They give them quality.
They shelter them.
They guard them.
They create them but do not possess them.
They work for them but expect no reward.
They bring them to maturity but do not control them.
This is called invisible attainment.
