When man is enriched with TÃª,
He may be identified with an innocent child.
He is free from the stings of insects,
Free from the claws of wild beasts,
Free from the attacks of devouring birds.
None of his bones or muscles are said to be strong,
But the grip of his hand is always firm.
Nothing concerning the union of male and female is yet known,
But potentiality is evident.
The essence of his life is perfect.
He can cry all the time without losing his voice.
His inner harmony is supreme.
To be aware of inner harmony is to abide with reality.
To abide with reality is to be enlightened.
However, to push life to the full leads to evil.
The mind forcing one's potential is artificial.
When things are artificial, they lead to decay.
This deviates from Tao.
That which deviates from Tao ends life soon.
