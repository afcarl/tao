In ancient times the best man of Tao was refined and deeply enlightened.
His depth can hardly be measured.
Because his depth can hardly be measured,
I will try to draw a picture of him.
Prudent, as if he were wading in a cold stream in the winter;
Calm, as if he did not want to disturb his neighbors;
Respectful, as if he were a guest;
Fluid, as if he were ice melting;
Solid, as if he were an uncarved block;
Vacant, as if he were a valley;
Lacking clear discriminations, as if he were impure;
Who is able to gradually reach purity from impurity through quiescence?
Who is able to gradually grow lively from motion through motionlessness?
One who abides in Tao never desires to reach an extreme.
Because he never desires to reach an extreme,
He can remain in the old, yet become the new.
