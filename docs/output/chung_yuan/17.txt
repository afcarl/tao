The best leader is one whom no one knows.
The next best is one who is intimate with the people and is flattered by them.
The next is one who is feared by the people.
The next is one who is held in contempt by the people.
Therefore, when one's sincerity is not sufficient, one does not have the confidence of the people.
Be cautious! and spare words.
Then when work is done and things are accomplished,
People will say that things happened by themselves.
