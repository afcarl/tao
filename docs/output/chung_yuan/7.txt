The existences of heaven and earth are long-lasting.
Their existences are long-lasting because they do not conceive of their existences as existences.
Therefore, their existences are long-lasting.
When the wise stays back, he steps forward.
When he forgets his self, he finds his self.
Is it not through selflessness that one achieves selfhood?
