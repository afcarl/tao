Man's name or man's self - which is closer to him?
Man's self or his property - which is more valuable to him?
Success or failure - which is more harmful to him?
Things that are cherished more, cost more.
The more that is kept, the more that is missed.
The man who is easily contented is free from shame.
The man who knows the right time to stop is free from danger.
Thus, he will last long.
