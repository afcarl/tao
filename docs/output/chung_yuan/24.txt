To lift the heel is not to stand.
To take long strides is not to walk.
To show off is not to shine.
To insist that one is right is not to be distinct.
To claim credit is to have no credit.
To be proud of oneself is not to be the best.
From the point of view of Tao, all of these are extras which things themselves do not like.
Therefore, the man of Tao does not abide with them.
