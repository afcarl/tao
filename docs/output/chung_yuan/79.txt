When a serious resentment is reconciled,
Some resentment certainly remains.
Thus, reconciliation cannot be considered the best way.
Although the wise holds to the contract prepared by the debtor,
He never forces the debtor to fulfill his responsibility.
Therefore, the man of Tê holds only to the contract,
While the man without Tê presses for taxes.
The way of nature is free from intimacy.
Yet it constantly stays with the good man.
