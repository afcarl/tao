The wise man is free from his own mind,
But identifies the people's minds as mind.
He considers good as good,
But he also considers not-good as good.
Thus, his attainment of non-differentiation is successful.
He considers truth as truth,
But he also considers not-truth as truth.
Thus, his attainment of non-differentiation is perfected.
In the world, the wise conscientiously non-differentiates
The minds of the people.
Because people rely on their senses of hearing and seeing,
The wise treats them as innocent children.
