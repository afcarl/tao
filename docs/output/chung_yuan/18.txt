As soon as the great Tao is cast aside,
There prevails the teaching of benevolence and righteousness.
As soon as intellection and prudence are esteemed,
There is produced the great falsehood.
As soon as the members of a family are no longer at peace,
There is a demand for filial piety and love.
As soon as a nation is in confusion and rebellion,
There is a claim for loyal officers.
