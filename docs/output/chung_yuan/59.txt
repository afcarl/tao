In guiding people and working according to nature,
It is best to follow renunciation.
Following renunciation means returning soon.
Returning soon means accumulating attainment.
Accumulating attainment, everything can be dealt with.
Dealing with everything leads to limitlessness.
With limitlessness, one can govern the country.
Governing the country through its origin leads to endurance.
This means that to root deeply and to plant firmly leads to longevity and eternal consciousness.
Therefore, governing a large nation is as simple as preparing a dish of food.
