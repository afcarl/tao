Tao is real and free from action, yet nothing is not acted upon.
If rulers abide with it, all things transmute by themselves.
If, in the process of transmutation, intention emerges, it must be overcome by the original non-differentiation of the nameless.
To experience the original non-differentiation of the nameless, one should also be free from intending to have no-intention.
To be free from intending to have no-intention is to be quiescent.
Thereby, the world is naturally led to tranquillity.
