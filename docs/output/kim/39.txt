The things of old that have attained the One:
Heaven, having attained the One, is clear;
Earth, having attained the One, is steady;
Spirits, having attained the One, possess their numinous power;
Valleys, having attained the One, are full;
The ten thousand things, having attained the One, come to life;
Kings and princes, having attained the One, become the model for all under Heaven.
It is by virtue of the One that they become what they are.
Were Heaven not clear by virtue of that,
I fear it would soon shatter;
Were Earth not steady by virtue of that,
I fear it would soon collapse;
Were spirits not to possess their numinous power by virtue of that,
I fear they would soon cease to be;
Were valleys not full by virtue of that,
I fear they would soon dry up;
Were the ten thousand things not to come to life by virtue of that,
I fear they would soon perish;
Were kings and princes not noble and high by virtue of that,
I fear they would soon fall.
Therefore, for the noble the humble is the root;
For the high the low is the foundation.
For this reason, kings and princes
Refer to themselves as "the orphaned one," "the widowed one," and "the ill-provided one."
Isn't this because the humble is the root?
Is it not?
Therefore, if you tally your honors you will count none.
Don't try to jingle like jade-bells,
Rather, sound like rolling rocks.
