He knows the male,
Yet holds fast to the female,
And thus becomes the ravine of all under Heaven.
When he becomes the ravine of all under Heaven,
The constant Te will never desert him.
He returns to the baby.
He knows white,
Yet holds fast to black,
And thus becomes the model for all under Heaven.
When he becomes the model for all under Heaven,
The constant Te will never fail him.
He returns to the infinite.
He knows glory,
Yet holds fast to ignominy,
And thus becomes the valley of all under Heaven.
When he becomes the valley of all under Heaven,
His constant Te will be sufficient,
He returns to the uncarved block.
When the uncarved block scatters, it turns into vessels.
When the sage uses them,
He becomes chief of ministers.
Therefore great cutting does not split.
