All under Heaven recognize beautiful as beautiful,
But this is none other than ugly.
Everyone recognizes good as good,
But this is none other than bad.
Therefore being and non-being rise together;
Difficult and easy complete each other;
Long and short shape each other;
High and low lean on each other;
Sound and voice come in harmony;
Front and back accompany each other.
Therefore the sage
Relies on no-action,
Practices wordless teaching.
There rise the ten thousand things, but he disowns nothing,
He gives them life, yet does not possess them;
Rules them, yet does not depend on them;
His work is done, but he never dwells in it.
Truly, since he never dwells,
He never departs.
