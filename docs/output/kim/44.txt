Your name or your body, which is dearer?
Your body or your possessions, which is more valuable?
Gaining or losing, which worries you more?
Therefore, when your craving is excessive, your spending is extravagant.
When you store much, you are bound to lose much.
Know how to be content, and you will not be disgraced.
Know when to stop, and you will be free from danger.
Thus you will be long-lasting.
