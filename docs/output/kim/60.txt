Governing a large state
Is like boiling a small fish.
When you rule all under Heaven according to Tao,
The spirits of the dead cease to exercise supernatural power.
It is not that they cease to exercise supernatural power.
Their supernatural power does not harm the people.
It is not simply that their supernatural power does not harm the people.
The sage, too, does not harm the people.
Since neither of them harms the people,
Their Te, united, returns.
