You look at it but don't see it.
So you name it the Invisible.
You listen to it but don't hear it.
So you name it the Inaudible.
You grasp at it but don't touch it.
So you name it the Intangible.
These three
Are beyond scrutiny.
Therefore, blend them into one.
No brightness above it,
No darkness below it -
Boundless, it cannot be named.
Return to the objectless object.
It is called the shapeless shape -
The formless form.
It is called the vague and dim.
You meet it but don't see its head.
You follow it but don't see its back.
Hold on to the Tao of old,
And thereby ride the being of now.
Know the old beginning,
Which is called the thread of Tao.
