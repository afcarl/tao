All under Heaven has its beginning,
Which may be regarded as the mother of all under Heaven.
Having recognized its mother,
You know the child, also;
Having known the child,
You hold fast to its mother, also.
Thus you will be free of danger till the end of your life.
Block the holes,
Shut the gates,
And you will never be spent till your last day.
Open up the holes,
Busy yourself with activities,
And you will never be saved till your last day.
To see what is small is called clear sight;
To hold fast to what is soft is called strength.
Use the light,
Return to clear sight,
And you will never bring misfortune upon yourself.
This is called following the constant.
