Tao gives life [to the ten thousand things];
Te nurtures them.
Materiality shapes them;
The circumstances fulfill them.
Therefore, of the ten thousand things
None fails to revere Tao and honor Te.
The revering of Tao,
The honoring of Te -
No one orders it.
It is always so of itself [tzu-jan].
Therefore Tao gives them life;
Te nurtures them.
Makes them flourish and grow;
Gives them security and comfort;
Feeds and shelters them.
To give them life, without possessing them;
To rule them, without depending on them;
To lead them, without presiding over them -
This is called the mysterious Te.
