Of old a man who practiced Tao best
Did not thereby seek to make the people bright,
But to make them ignorant.
The people are difficult to govern,
Because they are too clever.
Therefore, to govern a state through knowledge
Is the robbing of the state;
Not to govern a state through knowledge
Is a blessing to the state.
Those who know these two
Also know the standard.
Always to know the standard
Is called the mysterious Te.
Deep and far-reaching is the mysterious Te!
Turn away from things.
Only then will the great obedience be attained.
