When Tao prevails under Heaven,
Fleet-footed horses are taken out [of service] to fertilize the fields.
When Tao fails to prevail under Heaven,
War horses breed on the sacred mounds outside the city walls.
No misfortune is greater than not knowing contentment;
No calamity is greater than wanting to possess.
Therefore, he who knows the sufficiency of contentment
Is always contented.
