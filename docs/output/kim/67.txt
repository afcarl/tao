All under Heaven says that
My Tao is great yet doesn't look like it [Tao].
Truly, because it is great,
It doesn't look like it.
If it did,
It would have turned out a petty one long ago.
I have three treasures.
I hold and cherish them.
The first is called mercifulness;
The second, frugality;
The third, refusal to be ahead of all under Heaven.
Being merciful, you can therefore be brave;
Being frugal, you can therefore be liberal;
Refusing to be ahead of all under Heaven,
You can therefore become the leader of the vessels.
Now, to be brave, forsaking mercifulness,
To be liberal, forsaking frugality,
To be ahead, forsaking being behind
Is death.
With mercifulness -
If you fight, you will be triumphant,
If you defend, you will be invincible.
Whatever Heaven is about to save
Heaven will protect it with mercifulness.
