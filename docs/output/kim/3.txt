If you do not exalt the worthy,
You will keep the people from contention.
If you do not treasure rare goods,
You will keep them from stealing.
If you do not exhibit things that may arouse their desire,
You will keep their minds in peace.
Therefore the sage, in governing the people,
Makes their minds empty,
Their stomachs full,
Their ambitions weak,
Their bones strong.
