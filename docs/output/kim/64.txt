What is at rest is easy to hold;
What has not yet shown its sign is easy to prepare for.
What is tender is easy to break up;
What is minute is easy to scatter.
Deal with things before they become reality;
Put things in order before disorder arises.
A tree as big as a man's embrace
Grows from the tip of a fine hair.
A terrace nine stories high
Rises from a heap of earth.
A journey of a thousand miles
Starts from where one stands.
Whoever acts on it will ruin it;
Whoever lays hold of it will lose it.
For this reason the sage
Does nothing and therefore ruins nothing;
Lays hold of nothing and therefore loses nothing.
People, in handling their affairs,
Always ruin their work on the verge of completion.
Be careful at the end as at the start,
And you will never fail.
For this reason the sage
Desires not to desire,
Does not treasure rare goods,
Learns not to learn.
He returns to what the multitude passes by.
He thus helps the ten thousand things to be so of themselves [tzu jan],
And does not try to rule.
