When you pursue learning, you gain day by day.
When you pursue Tao, you lose day by day.
You lose more and more,
Until you reach thereby the point of no-action.
You do nothing yet leave nothing undone.
You take all under Heaven
Always through no activity.
Should you rely on activity,
You will find it insufficient to take all under Heaven.
