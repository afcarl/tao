You allay the great discontent,
Yet, surely, there will still remain some discontent.
How can this be considered good?
Therefore the sage
Holds the left-hand tally,
Makes no claims on the people.
The man of Te oversees the tally,
The man of no Te oversees tax-collection.
The way of Heaven favors none,
Always sides with the good man.
