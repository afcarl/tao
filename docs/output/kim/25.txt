There is something undifferentiated
That precedes the birth of Heaven and Earth.
Silent and still,
It stands by itself and never changes -
All-pervading and never in danger.
One may regard it as the mother of Heaven and Earth.
I don't know its proper name;
I address it as Tao.
Were I forced to name it, I would call it Great.
"Great" means "to go."
"To go" means "far away."
"Far away" means "to return."
Therefore Tao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The king is also great.
In the universe there are four greats.
King is one of them.
The measure for man is Earth;
The measure for Earth is Heaven;
The measure for Heaven is Tao;
The measure for Tao is tzu-jan.
