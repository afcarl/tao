Tao
Is the sanctuary of the ten thousand things,
The good man's treasure,
The bad man's refuge.
Beautiful words can buy honor,
Beautiful deeds can benefit people.
Though a man may be bad,
How can he be abandoned?
Therefore, on occasion of crowning the Son of Heaven
Or installing the three ministers of state,
Rather than present a large disc of jade, accompanied by a team of four horses,
Better remain in your seat and offer a tribute of this Tao.
Why did the ancients honor this Tao?
Did they not say:
"You get thereby what you seek;
You escape thereby when you have sinned."
Therefore they regarded it as the most precious of all things under Heaven.
