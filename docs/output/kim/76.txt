People are soft and weak when born,
But bard and strong when dead.
Plants are soft and supple when born,
But dry and shriveled when dead.
Therefore the hard and strong are companions of death,
The soft and weak are companions of life.
Therefore a strong weapon loses,
A strong tree breaks.
The strong and big belong below,
The soft and weak belong above.
