A good warrior is not belligerent;
A good fighter is not given to anger;
One who is good at winning does not engage the enemy;
One who is good at using others takes the lower position.
This is called the Te of non-contention;
This is called making use of the strength of others;
This is called fit to be Heaven's mate.
It is the ultimate [truth] of old.
