When the government is dull,
The people are simple.
When the government is keen,
The people are discontented.
Bad fortune is what good fortune leans on;
Good fortune is where bad fortune lurks.
Who knows the fortune's end?
There is nothing straight.
What is straight turns monstrous.
What is beautiful turns grotesque.
Man has been deluded
From time immemorial.
Therefore the sage
Is square without cutting;
Honest without scraping;
Straight without overbearing;
Bright without dazzling.
