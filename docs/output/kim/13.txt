"Be alarmed by favor and disgrace;
High rank brings you great misfortune, as if your own body."
What is the meaning of "Be alarmed by favor and disgrace"?
Regard favor as low.
Be alarmed to receive it;
Be alarmed to lose it.
This is the meaning of "Be alarmed by favor and disgrace."
What is the meaning of "High rank brings you great misfortune, as if your own body"?
My reason for having great misfortune
Is my having a body.
If I had no body,
What misfortune would I have?
Therefore, if a man values the care of his body above ruling all under Heaven,
He may be given all under Heaven.
If a man cherishes his body more than ruling all under Heaven,
All under Heaven may be entrusted to him.
