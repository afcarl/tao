Heaven and Earth are everlasting.
The reason why they are everlasting
Is that they do not live for themselves.
That is why they can live long.
Therefore the sage
Puts himself last and finds himself first;
He leaves himself out and finds himself preserved.
Is it not because he is selfless
That he can fulfill himself?
