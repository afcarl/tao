Holding fast to the great form,
Go anywhere under Heaven.
Wherever you go, nothing will harm you -
You will be safe and in peace.
Music and fine food
Make the passing stranger stop.
When Tao comes out from the mouth,
How flavorless it is!
You look at it, but it is invisible.
You listen to it, but it is inaudible.
You use it, but it is inexhaustible.
