Rather than hold the bowl until it fills to the brim,
Better quit in time.
Hammer the blade to its sharpest,
And you will be unable to preserve it long.
Fill the hall with gold and jade,
And you will be unable to keep them safe.
He who is arrogant with his wealth and position
Will bring calamity upon himself.
To withdraw when the task is accomplished
Is the way of Heaven.
