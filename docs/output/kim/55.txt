He who possesses Te in abundance
May be likened to a newborn baby.
Bees, scorpions and vipers do not sting it;
Ferocious beasts do not seize it;
Birds of prey do not attack it.
Its bones are weak and its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm.
It doesn't yet know the union of male and female, yet its organ is erect.
Its vital energy is perfect.
It screams all day yet never becomes hoarse.
Its harmony is perfect.
To know harmony is called [to know the] constant.
To know the constant is called enlightenment.
To improve upon one's life is called ill omen.
When the mind dictates the vital breath, it is called forcing.
When a thing reaches its prime, it becomes old.
Forcing is called contrary to Tao.
What is contrary to Tao expires early.
