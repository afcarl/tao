The large state is the lower reaches of a river,
The place where all under Heaven meets -
The female of all under Heaven.
The female always overcomes the male by stillness.
With stillness she plays the lower part.
Therefore, when the large state plays the lower part toward the small state,
It takes the small state.
When the small state plays the lower part toward the large state,
It takes the large state.
Therefore some take by playing the lower part;
Some are taken by playing the lower part.
The large state merely wants to unite with the other and nurture it;
The small state merely wants to join and serve the other.
Each gets what it wants.
It is right that the large state should play the lower part.
