Thirty spokes share one hub;
On its non-being depends the usefulness of the wheel.
You make a vessel, kneading clay;
On its non-being depends the usefulness of the vessel.
You make a room, carving out doors and windows;
On its non-being depends the usefulness of the room.
Therefore, being's advantage
Is non-being's usefulness.
