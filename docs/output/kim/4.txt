Tao is empty,
You may use it but never fill it.
Fathomless, it is like the progenitor of the ten thousand things.
[It] blunts the sharpness,
Unravels the tangles,
Softens the brilliance,
Identifies with the dust.
Deep and still, it seems as though existing forever.
I don't know whose son it is.
It bears the image of God's forefather.
