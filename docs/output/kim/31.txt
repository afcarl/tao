Dazzling arms
Are instruments of ill omen.
All creatures detest them.
Therefore the man of Tao does not keep company with them.
At home, the prince honors the left;
At war, the right.
Arms
Are instruments of ill omen -
No instruments for the prince.
When necessary to use them,
It's best to do so in calm disinterestedness.
You do not celebrate a victory.
To celebrate a victory
Is to delight in the slaughter of people.
He who delights in the slaughter of people
Will never realize his ambition under Heaven.
At times of good fortune, you honor the left;
At times of misfortune, you honor the right.
The second in command stands on the left;
The supreme commander stands on the right.
This means they stand as if observing funeral rites.
Having committed mass killings,
Let us weep with deep sorrow;
For a victory, let us observe funeral rites.
