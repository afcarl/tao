The look of the great Te
Follows from Tao alone.
It is Tao embodied.
How vague and dim it is!
Vague and dim -
In it are forms.
Vague and dim -
In it are things.
Deep and dark -
In it is the vital essence,
Which is most real.
In it is evidence.
From the time of old till today,
Its name has never departed.
By it you view the beginning of all.
How do I know the shape of the beginning of all?
By this.
