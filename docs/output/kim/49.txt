The sage has no fixed mind;
He takes the people's mind as his own.
I accept as good those who are good;
I also accept as good those who are not good.
Such is Te's goodness.
I trust those who trust;
I also trust those who do not trust.
Such is Te's trust.
The sage, in ruling all under Heaven,
Makes his mind one with it.
All his subjects set their ears and eyes on him.
He regards them all as his children.
