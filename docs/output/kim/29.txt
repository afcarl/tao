Do you wish to conquer all under Heaven and rule it?
I see you will never succeed.
All under Heaven is a sacred vessel;
No one can rule it by action.
Whoever rules it by action destroys it;
Whoever seizes it loses it.
Therefore, among the creatures,
Some go, some follow;
Some breathe lightly, some blow hard;
Some are strong, some are weak;
Some break, some fall.
Therefore the sage
Shuns extremes,
Shuns extravagance,
Shuns vanity.
