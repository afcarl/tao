He who knows others is wise;
He who knows himself is enlightened.
He who overcomes others has strength;
He who overcomes himself is strong.
He who knows to be content is rich.
He who persists in his action is strong-willed.
He who does not lose his place is long-lasting.
He who dies but does not perish is long-lived.
