Tao gives birth to One;
One gives birth to Two;
Two give birth to Three,
Three give birth to the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things carry the yin on their backs and hold the yang in their arms;
And attain harmony through the blending of the two energies.
What people detest most
Is to be orphaned, widowed and ill-provided.
But that is how kings and princes call themselves.
Therefore, of things, some gain by losing,
Some lose by gaining.
What others teach
I also teach.
"The violent one will not attain his death."
I will take this to be my teacher.
