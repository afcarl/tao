Rest your shining spirit and embrace the One.
Can you forever hold onto it?
Concentrate your breath and attain the utmost softness.
Can you become a baby?
Clean your mysterious mirror.
Can you keep it free of blemish?
Love the people and keep the state in peace.
Can you rule through no-action?
As the gate of Heaven opens and closes,
Can you play the female part?
As bright light reaches all four directions,
Can you remain unknowing?
To give people life and nurture them;
To give them life, without possessing them;
To rule them, without depending on them;
To lead them, without directing them -
This is called the mysterious Te.
