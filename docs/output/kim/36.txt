When you want to shrink it,
You must first stretch it.
When you want to make it weak,
You must first make it strong.
When you want to make it fall,
You must first make it rise.
When you want to rob it,
You must first give it.
This is called subtle light.
The soft and weak prevails over the hard and strong.
The fish may not leave the depths.
The sharp instrument of the state
May not be shown to the people.
