Perfect going leaves no tracks.
Perfect speech has no flaws.
Perfect counting uses no counters.
The perfect lock uses no bolt; it is impossible to open.
The perfect knot uses no rope; it is impossible to untie.
Therefore the sage
Is always perfect in delivering people from distress.
Thus he abandons no one.
He is always perfect in delivering creatures from distress.
Thus he abandons no creature.
This is called following the light.
Therefore the perfect man
Is the leader of the imperfect man;
The imperfect man
Is the asset of the perfect man.
He who does not treasure his leader,
He who does not cherish his asset,
Though he may be wise, is greatly deluded.
This is called the fundamental secret.
