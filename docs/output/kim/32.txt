Tao is forever nameless.
Though the uncarved block is small,
No one under Heaven can make it his subject.
If kings and princes hold fast to it,
The ten thousand things will submit of their own accord;
Heaven and Earth will unite to send sweet dew;
The people will be fair of themselves, without being ordered.
When the cutting begins, names come to be.
As soon as names appear,
Know that it's time to stop.
By knowing this, you will be free from danger.
To draw an analogy, the working of Tao under Heaven
Is like streams and rapids flowing into great rivers and seas.
