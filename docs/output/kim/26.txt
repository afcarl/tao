The heavy is the root of the light;
Stillness is the lord of bustle.
Therefore the prince,
Traveling all day,
Never parts with his baggage-wagon.
Even at a magnificent sight,
He remains at ease, unmoved.
How could the lord of ten thousand chariots
Regard his own body more lightly than all under Heaven?
If you act lightly, the root is lost;
If you bustle, the lord is lost.
