What is firmly planted cannot be pulled out;
What is tightly held in the arms cannot slip away,
So that the descendants will never stop offering ancestral sacrifice.
Cultivate it in yourself,
And its Te will be genuine.
Cultivate it in the household,
And its Te will be more than sufficient.
Cultivate it in the village,
And its Te will be long-lasting.
Cultivate it in the state,
And its Te will be plentiful.
Cultivate it in all under Heaven,
And its Te will be all-encompassing.
Therefore, observe yourself through yourself;
The household through the household;
The village through the village;
The state through the state;
All under Heaven through all under Heaven.
How do I know that all under Heaven is so?
With this.
