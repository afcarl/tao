Let the state be small and its people few.
Let the thousand contrivances go idle.
Let the people take death seriously and not move to distant places.
Though they may have boats and carriages,
They will not ride in them.
Though they may have armor and weapons,
They will not display them.
Let the people return to the practice of knotting cords.
They will relish what they eat,
Find their clothes beautiful,
Be content in their homes,
Delight in their customs.
States may be within sight of one another,
So that one may hear cocks and dogs from a neighboring state;
Yet people will grow old and die
Without trafficking with another state.
