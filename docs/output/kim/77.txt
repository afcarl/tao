The way of Heaven -
Isn't it like stretching a bow?
You press down the high,
Raise the low,
Take away the excess,
Add to the deficient.
The way of Heaven
Takes away from those who have too much and gives to those who have not enough.
The way of man
Is not so.
It takes away from those who have not enough and offers to those who have too much.
Who can have too much and offer to all under Heaven?
Only the man of Tao can.
Therefore the sage
Rules without depending on anyone.
His work is done, but he never dwells in it.
He does not wish to show his worthiness.
