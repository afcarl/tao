He who knows does not speak;
He who speaks does not know.
Block the holes,
Shut the gates.
[He] blunts the sharpness,
Unravels the tangles,
Softens the brilliance,
Identifies with the dust.
This is called mysterious identity.
Therefore you can neither befriend him,
Nor alienate him,
Nor benefit him,
Nor harm him,
Nor exalt him,
Nor humble him.
That is why he is the noblest of all under Heaven.
