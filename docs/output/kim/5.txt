Heaven and Earth are not humane:
They treat the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is not humane:
He treats the people as straw dogs.
The space between Heaven and Earth -
Is it not as though it were a bellows?
It is empty, yet inexhaustible.
Ever active, it gives off more and more.
Much talk inevitably leads to predicament.
It is better to hold on to the void.
