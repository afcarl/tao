The people starve
Because the ruler consumes too much tax-grain.
Because of this they starve.
The people are hard to govern
Because the ruler rules through action [yu wei].
Because of this they are hard to govern.
The people take their death lightly
Because the ruler hoards his life.
Because of this they take their death lightly.
Truly, one who does nothing with life
Is wiser than one who prizes [the value of] life.
