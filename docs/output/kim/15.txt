Of old a man who practiced Tao best
Had insight into the subtlest and penetrated into the darkest.
His depth was not to be plumbed.
Truly, because his depth was not to be plumbed,
He could be portrayed only arbitrarily:
Hesitant as if crossing a river in winter;
Cautious as if fearing all four sides;
Inviolable like a guest;
Loose like ice about to thaw;
Simple like the uncarved block;
Empty like a valley;
Murky like muddy water.
Who can be muddy and yet, keeping still, slowly turn clear?
Who can be calm and yet, keeping active, slowly come to life?
He who embraces this Tao
Never wishes to be full.
Truly, because he is never full,
He decays yet renews himself.
