Trustworthy words are not beautiful,
Beautiful words are not trustworthy.
The good are not eloquent,
The eloquent are not good.
The wise are not learned,
The learned are not wise.
The sage stocks up nothing.
After using for others what he has,
He finds himself with still more.
After giving to others what he has,
He finds his stock even greater.
The way of Heaven
Is to benefit and not to harm.
The way of the sage
Is to rule and not to contend.
