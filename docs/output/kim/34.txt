The great Tao overflows left and right,
The ten thousand things depend on it for their lives, and it never disowns them.
Its work is done, but it has no name.
It clothes and nurtures the ten thousand things, yet it makes no claim to be lord over them.
It is always free of desire.
It may be called small.
The ten thousand things return to it, yet it makes no claim to be lord over them.
It may be called great.
Because it never regards itself as great,
It can accomplish its greatness.
