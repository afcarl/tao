Being brave in daring leads to death,
Being brave in not daring leads to life.
Of these two,
One is advantageous and the other injurious.
What Heaven detests -
Who knows its reason?
Therefore even the sage finds it hard to tell.
The way of Heaven -
It never contends yet is good at winning,
It never speaks yet is good at responding.
It comes of itself without being invited,
It seems remiss yet good at planning.
Heaven's net is vast.
Though its meshes are coarse, nothing escapes it.
