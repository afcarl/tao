When the people do not fear death,
How can you frighten them with death?
Suppose the people do always fear death,
And we can seize and kill
Those who are lawless.
But who would dare to do so?
There is always the one who administers killings, and he does the killing.
If you do the killing, taking his place,
This is called hewing wood taking the place of the master-carpenter.
If you hew wood taking the place of the master-carpenter,
You will seldom escape injuring your own hand.
