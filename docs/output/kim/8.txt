The supreme good is like water.
Water benefits the ten thousand things, yet contends with nothing.
It dwells where everyone is loath to be.
That is why it is near to Tao.
In dwelling, the good is the ground,
In thought, the good is depth,
In association, the good is gentleness,
In speech, the good is truthfulness,
In government, the good is order,
In work, the good is ability,
In movement, the good is timeliness.
Truly, because it [water] contends with nothing,
It is beyond reproach.
