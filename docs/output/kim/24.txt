He who tiptoes cannot remain standing;
He who strides cannot travel;
He who shows himself has no bright presence;
He who claims to be right does not shine;
The boastful have no merit;
The conceited do not last long.
From Tao's standpoint
Such things may be called excess food and superfluous action.
Creatures abhor them.
Therefore the man of Tao stays away from them.
