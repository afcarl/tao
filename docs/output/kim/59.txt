In ruling the people and serving Heaven
Nothing is better than being sparing.
Truly, being sparing
Means submitting early.
Submitting early
Means accumulating Te heavily.
If you accumulate Te heavily,
There will be nothing you cannot overcome.
If there is nothing you cannot overcome,
You will find no limit.
If you find no limit,
You will be fit to rule a state.
If you possess the mother of the state,
You will be long-lasting.
This is called deeply rooted and firmly planted.
It is the way of long life and lasting sight.
