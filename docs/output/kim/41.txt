When the highest type of man hears Tao,
He practices it diligently.
When the middle type hears Tao,
He half believes and half disbelieves it.
When the lowest type hears Tao,
He laughs out loud.
If he didn't,
It couldn't possibly be considered Tao.
Therefore the Chien yen has it:
"The bright Tao looks dark;
The forward-moving Tao seems retreating;
The level Tao seems bumpy;
The highest Te is like a valley;
Perfect white looks soiled;
The broad Te seems insufficient;
The firm Te seems precarious;
The pure Te seems discolored;
The great square has no corners;
The great vessel takes long to complete;
The great sound is inaudible;
The great form is shapeless."
Tao is hidden and nameless.
Truly, Tao alone supports [all things] and brings them to completion.
