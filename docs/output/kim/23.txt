Tzu-jan rarely speaks.
Therefore no windstorm lasts all morning;
No rainstorm lasts all day.
Who causes these things?
Heaven and Earth.
If even Heaven and Earth can cause nothing to last forever,
How could man?
Therefore those who follow Tao
Are one with Tao.
Those who attain Te are one with Te;
Those who lose [Te] are one with the loss.
When a man is one with Tao,
Tao also rejoices at gaining him;
When a man is one with Te,
Te also rejoices at gaining him;
When a man is one with the loss,
The loss also rejoices at gaining him.
When you don't trust others,
They will not trust you.
