The man of superior virtue [te] is not virtuous;
Therefore he has virtue.
The man of inferior virtue never fails to be virtuous;
Therefore he has no virtue.
A man of superior virtue never acts;
He seeks nothing through action.
A man of inferior virtue acts;
He seeks [virtue] through action.
A man of superior humaneness [jen] acts;
Yet he seeks nothing through action.
A man of superior righteousness [i] acts;
He seeks [righteousness] through action.
A man of superior ritual propriety [li] acts;
And when others fail to respond accordingly,
He stretches his arm and charges at them.
Therefore, when Tao is lost, virtue appears;
When virtue is lost, humaneness appears;
When humaneness is lost, righteousness appears;
When righteousness is lost, ritual propriety appears.
Truly, ritual propriety means
The thinning of loyalty and truthfulness,
And the origin of disorder.
Foresight
Is the flower of Tao,
The beginning of folly.
Therefore the great man
Dwells in the thick,
Not in the thin,
In the fruit,
Not in the flower.
Therefore he discards that and takes this.
