Tao never does,
Yet leaves nothing undone.
If kings and princes hold fast to this,
The ten thousand things will transform of themselves.
Should desires arise after transformation,
I shall calm them with the nameless, uncarved block.
The nameless, uncarved block
Brings desirelessness.
With desirelessness comes stillness,
And all under Heaven will be at peace by itself.
