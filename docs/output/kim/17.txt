Of the rulers, the best is one of whose existence his people are [merely] aware;
Next comes one whom they love and praise;
Next comes one whom they fear;
Next comes one whom they despise.
When you don't trust them,
They will not trust you.
Calm, I rarely speak.
Yet the task is accomplished;
The people call me tzu-jan.
