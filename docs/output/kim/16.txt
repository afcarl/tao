Attain the utmost emptiness,
Hold fast to stillness.
The ten thousand things rise together;
I see them return.
All things flourish;
Each reverts to its root.
Reverting to the root is called stillness.
It means submission to fate.
Submission to fate is called [submission to] the constant.
To know the constant is called enlightenment.
If you do not know the constant,
You act blindly, ruining yourself.
Knowing the constant, you will be all-embracing.
All-embracing, hence impartial;
Impartial, hence king;
King, hence Heaven;
Heaven, hence Tao;
Tao, hence long-lasting.
Thus, you will be free of danger until the end of your life.
