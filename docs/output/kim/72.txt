When the people do not fear the authority [of the sovereign],
The supreme authority arrives.
They are neither contented in their abodes,
Nor satisfied with their lives.
Only because they are not satisfied,
They cannot be suppressed.
Therefore the sage
Knows himself but does not show himself,
Cherishes himself but does not exalt himself.
Therefore he discards that and takes this.
