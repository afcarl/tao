He who assists the ruler by Tao
Does not resort to arms to dominate all under Heaven by force.
This thing loves to rebound.
Where troops have encamped,
Brambles grow;
After the raising of great armies
A famine follows invariably.
A good man merely lets it bear fruit;
He does not seek to force it.
He lets it bear fruit; he is not vainglorious.
He lets it bear fruit; he is not boastful.
He lets it bear fruit; he is not arrogant.
He lets it bear fruit, out of necessity.
He lets it bear fruit and does not force it.
When a thing reaches its prime, it becomes old.
Forcing is called contrary to Tao.
What is contrary to Tao expires early.
