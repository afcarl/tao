Banish sagehood and wisdom,
And the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Banish humaneness and righteousness,
And the people will return to filial piety and parental love.
Banish cleverness and profit,
And there will be no more thieves and robbers.
These three
I take to be insufficient as maxims.
Therefore, let them be attached to the following:
Display plainness and embrace the uncarved block,
Diminish the self and reduce desires.
