My words are very easy to understand,
Very easy to put into practice.
Yet no one under Heaven can understand them
Or put them into practice.
Words have their source,
Deeds have their lord.
Truly, because people don't know this,
They don't understand me.
Those who know me are few;
Those who follow me are rare.
For this reason the sage
Wears coarse cloth but carries jade inside.
