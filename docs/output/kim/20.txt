Banish learning, and you will have no worries.
"Yes" and "yeah" -
How far apart are they?
Good and bad -
How far apart are they?
"What others fear
You must fear."
How outlandish!
It will never end.
Everybody is cheerful,
As if enjoying a great feast;
As if going up to the terrace for the Spring Festival.
I alone am unexcited, giving no sign,
Like a baby who has not yet smiled;
Weary, as if nowhere to return.
Everybody has more than enough,
I alone seem dispossessed.
Mine is the mind of an ignorant man.
How indifferent!
Common folks are bright,
I alone am dark.
They are keen,
I alone am dull.
Adrift, I feel as if on the sea -
Blown by a high wind that seems never to come to rest.
Everybody is put to use,
I alone am stubborn and foolish like a boor.
Alone, different from others, I treasure the nursing mother.
