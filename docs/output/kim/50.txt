You come out to life and enter death.
The companions of life are three in ten;
The companions of death are three in ten:
The way humans live,
There are those who move into death-spots.
They too are three in ten.
Why is this so?
It is because of their hoarding of life.
I hear that those who nurture life well,
When traveling on land, do not meet wild buffaloes or tigers,
Nor do they, when going into battle, put on armor or shields.
The wild buffalo would find no place to thrust its horns;
The tiger would find no place to place its claws;
The sword would find no place to lodge its blade.
Why is this so?
Because for such men there are no death-spots.
