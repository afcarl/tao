Act through no-action,
Attend to no-affair,
Relish no-flavor,
Take the small as big and the few as many.
Repay hatred with Te.
Plan difficult things while they are easy.
Handle big things while they are small.
Difficult things under Heaven
Always arise from what is easy;
Big things under Heaven
Always arise from what is small.
For this reason the sage
Never intends big things,
And thus can accomplish big things.
He who agrees lightly invariably inspires little faith.
He who considers many things easy invariably encounters many difficulties.
For this reason even the sage considers things difficult;
Therefore he never encounters difficulties.
