To yield is to remain whole;
To bend is to get up straight;
To be hollow is to be full;
To decay is to renew;
To be small is to gain;
To have many is to be perplexed.
Therefore the sage,
Embracing the One, becomes the model for all under Heaven.
He does not show himself, therefore his presence is bright.
He does not claim to be right, therefore his virtue shines.
He is not boastful of his act, therefore his merit is great.
He is not conceited, therefore he is long-lasting.
Only because he does not contend,
No one under Heaven can contend with him.
Can the old saying "To yield is to remain whole"
Be an empty phrase?
Truly, he remains whole, and the world returns to him.
