Nothing under Heaven is softer and weaker than water.
Yet in attacking what is hard and strong
Nothing can surpass water,
Because nothing can destroy it.
That the weak prevails over the strong,
That the soft prevails over the hard -
This everyone under Heaven knows,
Yet none can practice it.
Therefore the sage says:
"He who takes on himself the shame of the state
Is called lord of the land;
He who takes on himself the misfortune of the state
Is called king of all under Heaven."
True words sound contrary.
