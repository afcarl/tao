Let me have even the slightest of wisdom.
Traveling the great way [Tao],
I will only fear going astray.
The great way is level.
Yet people prefer small paths.
The court is overrun with corruption;
The fields are overgrown with weeds;
The granaries are utterly empty;
Yet the officials wear embroidered clothes,
Carry sharp swords,
Feast on food and wine,
Possess more goods than they need.
This is called the robber's extravagance.
It is indeed contrary to Tao!
