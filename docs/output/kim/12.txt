The five colors make man's eyes go blind.
The five tones make man's ears go deaf.
The five tastes injure man's palate.
Hunting on horseback
Makes man's mind go crazy.
Rare goods
Impede man's action.
That is why the sage
Cares for the stomach, not for the eye.
Therefore he discards that and takes this.
