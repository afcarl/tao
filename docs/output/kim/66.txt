The great rivers and seas are kings of hundred valleys,
Because they are good at keeping low.
That is why they can be kings of hundred valleys.
Therefore, if you want to stand above the people,
You must keep low in speaking to them.
If you want to stand ahead of the people,
You must put yourself behind them.
For this reason the sage
Is above the people yet does not weigh heavy on them;
He is ahead of the people yet causes no harm to them.
Therefore all under Heaven are happy to uphold him and never tire of him.
Because he does not contend,
No one under Heaven can contend with him.
