"Govern the state according to what is right;
Use the troops by surprise tactics."
But take all under Heaven through no-action.
How do I know this is so?
Because of this -
The more bans and taboos under Heaven,
The poorer the people;
The more sharp instruments in the hands of the people,
The more trouble for the state;
The more skills the people have,
The more fanciful inventions appear;
The more laws and decrees,
The more thieves and robbers.
Therefore the sage says:
"I engage in no-action, and the people transform of themselves;
I love stillness, and the people correct themselves;
I engage in no work, and the people prosper of themselves;
I am free from desire, and the people turn into the uncarved block of themselves."
