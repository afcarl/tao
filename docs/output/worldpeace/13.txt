Accept disgrace indifferently.
Acknowledge misfortune as one of the human
conditions.

What does it mean to "accept disgrace
indifferently"?
Honor and disgrace are one in the Infinite.
Only by making distinctions does one
manifest disgrace.
Refusing to make distinctions
merges honor and disgrace into the
oneness of circumstances
which creates harmony.

What is meant by "acknowledging misfortune
as one of the human conditions"?

The body is a manifestation of Infinity
and the body is subject to being
affected by the other manifestations
of Infinity.
Misfortune is one of those other
manifestations.

However, as with disgrace,
refusing to distinguish misfortune and
fortune
creates indifference which keeps one
focused
on the oneness of Infinity
and creates peace in the self.

Stay centered in
your oneness with Infinity
and you can be entrusted with leadership.

See the world as yourself
and you will care for all things.
