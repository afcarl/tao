Only when one distinguishes beauty
does one create the unattractive.
Only when one distinguishes good
does one create evil.

Also by distinction,
Tangible and intangible create each other,
Difficult and easy define each other,
Long and short measure each other,
High and low determine each other,
Sound and silence echo each other,
Beginning and end follow each other.

Therefore, the sage goes about living in the
oneness of
all things,
teaching without speaking,
accepting and dismissing all things with
indifference,
creating without attachment,
working without credit.
Acts and deeds are completed and forgotten.

Because the sage is at one with Infinity,
she is immortal.
