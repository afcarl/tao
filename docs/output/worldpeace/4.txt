Infinity is an empty vessel enveloping all
manifestations,
yet it can never be filled.

It is the potential of all things tangible and
intangible.

It blunts the sharp and hones the blunt,
unravels knots and binds all things,
dulls the glare and shines the mundane,
manifests the dust and clears the air.

It is the essence of all things.
No one can comprehend its origin.

It is older than the concept of God.
