Ruling a country is like cooking a small fish.
If you forget your oneness with the fish,
you become confused in what you are
doing.

See the world as one with Infinity
and evil will be impotent.

Not that evil does not exist,
but because it is not distinguished
people harmonize with it.

If all of humanity is in harmony with the
oneness of Infinity,
not only will evil not confuse the people,
the sage himself will not confuse the people.

They will not confuse each other
and the oneness in each will harmonize
both.
