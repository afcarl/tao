Look and see the manifestations of the Infinite
but not its essence.

Listen and hear the manifestations of the Infinite
but not its essence.

Reach out and touch the manifestations of the
Infinite
but not its essence.

These three are one in their inability to relate
the essence of Infinity.

Above it is not light.
Below it is not dark.
It is neither light nor dark.

Infinity is the potential manifestation of all
things
and the essence into which all
manifestations
disintegrate.
Yet it is inconceivable and indescribable;
intangible but the essence of all
manifestations.

You cannot confront what has no head
and you cannot follow what has no tail.

Remember your oneness,
flow in the peace and harmony of Infinity,
live in the now, changing and flowing with
change.

There was no beginning.
This is the mystery of Infinity.
