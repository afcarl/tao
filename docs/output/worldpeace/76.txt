The human body is born soft and supple;
after death it is hard and stiff.
Plants and trees are pliant and limber
when they sprout,
after death they are inflexible and
rigid.

Therefore, hard and inflexible
are characteristics of death.
Pliant and flexible
are characteristics of life.

Thus, an army that is inflexible will be conquered
and a tree that does not yield to
the wind will snap.

The hard and inflexible will succumb.
The pliant and flexible will endure.
