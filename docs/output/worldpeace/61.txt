The great nation is like the ocean,
at one with Infinity,
it receives all waters in peace and harmony.

The female integrates the male
by residing in peace and harmony.

Therefore, if the great nation does not
distinguish
the small nation as separate from itself,
it will integrate the smaller nation
into its oneness.

If a small nation does not distinguish itself as
different from
from the great nation,
it will incorporate the peace and
harmony
of the great nation.

A great nation conquers by being a reservoir of
peace and harmony.
A small nation conquers by becoming one with the
great nation.

The great state is a reservoir
of peace and harmony for smaller states.
Small states seek the peace and harmony
of the great state.
Both get what they want; oneness.

It is natural for the great nation to
be receptive to the smaller nation.
