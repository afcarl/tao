In leading people and manifesting Infinity,
there is nothing as essential as
indifference.

Refusing to distinguish the self is the crucial
requirement
of indifference.
Indifference is the product of maintaining one's
focus
on the oneness of all things.
If you are at one with Infinity and the potential
of all things,
then you have no limitations.

If one has no limitations,
she is qualified to rule the world.

If she is at one with the world,
and consequently indifferent,
she will endure.

This is the manifestation of deep roots and a firm
foundation,
a oneness with Infinity,
immortality and perfect vision.
