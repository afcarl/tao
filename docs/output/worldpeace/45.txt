Great accomplishments seem incomplete
yet their legacy is long lived.

Great abundance seems insignificant
but it is inexhaustible.

A beam of light is just a wave.

Great skill seems easy.
Great eloquence seems boring.

Motion generates heat.
Stillness manifests the cold.

Peace and harmony are the nature of Infinity.
