The essence of Infinity can be ignored but never
uprooted.
If it is acknowledged, it cannot be lost
and it will manifest peace and harmony
from parents to children forever.

Acknowledge it in yourself
and peace and harmony will become real.
Acknowledge it in your family
and peace and harmony will grow.
Acknowledge it in your town
and peace and harmony will influence your
teachers.
Acknowledge it in your nation
and peace and harmony will displace war.
Acknowledge it in the universe
and peace and harmony will be everywhere.

Therefore,
see others as yourself,
see other families as your family,
see other towns as your town,
see other nations as your nation,
see the universe as a manifestation
of the Infinite.

How do I know this is the way things are?
Because I am at one with Infinity.
