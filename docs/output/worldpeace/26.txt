Infinity is the source of all physical
manifestations.
The Infinite stillness is the creator of the
churning
universe.

The sage travels all day over the land and sea
but does not lose sight of Infinity.
Though the manifestations of the earth are
wondrous and beautiful,
she remains indifferent because she remains
centered
in the Infinite oneness.

The leader of multitudes cannot afford to
lose her perspective.

Indulging in the physical manifestations
results in a loss of focus on the
Infinite.
To be caught up in distinguishing things,
narrows the leader's perspective
to that of her followers.
