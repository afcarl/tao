Knowing others is impossible.
Knowing one's self requires only a remembering
of one's unity with all things.

Conquering others requires force.
Conquering one's self requires letting go.

He who understands his oneness with Infinity
resides in peace.

Living one day at a time is the essence of harmony.
One who lives in harmony endures.

Passing through death's door is immortality.
