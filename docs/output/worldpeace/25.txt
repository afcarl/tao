Before the physical universe existed,
the potential of all things
permeated time and space.
It was silent and empty, loud and pregnant.
Solitary in its oneness, crowded in its potential,
static and dynamic, hot and cold, light and
dark.

The potential of all things,
for lack of another name,
I call it Infinity.

It permeates all things and non-things.
It manifests realities and disintegrates those
realities.
All things are birthed from it
and all things return to it.

Infinity is marvelous.
The physical universe is marvelous.
The earth is marvelous.
Human beings are marvelous.

These are the four realities.

Human beings are a manifestation of the
earth;
the earth, a manifestation of the physical
universe;
the physical universe, a manifestation of
Infinity;
Infinity, the potential of all things.
