Heaven and earth will pass away
but Infinity endures forever.

It had no beginning and so It can never end.
It is the inexhaustible essence of all things.

Because the sage remains behind
in her oneness with all things,
she anticipates all manifestations.

Being at one with Infinity,
she is indifferent.

Because she does not distinguish herself from
other beings,
she is completely fulfilled.
