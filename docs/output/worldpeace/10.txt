Manifesting body, mind and spirit,
can you stay centered in the oneness of
Infinity?

Fully manifesting and remaining flexible,
can you experience all manifestations
as a newborn baby?

Can you maintain the Infinite vision of oneness
by ignoring distinctions.

Remaining centered in oneness and leading others,
can you avoid manifesting arrogance?

Entering and exiting the gates of manifestations,
can you harmonize with Infinity?

Realizing your oneness with Infinity,
can you flow in harmony with It
by indifferently allowing things to come and
go?

Can you create and sustain things,
and yet remain unattached to them?

Can you work in harmony with all things,
without desiring acknowledgment for your
deeds?

Exemplifying oneness,
flowing in peace and harmony,
not distinguishing, not judging,
is the nature of Infinity.
