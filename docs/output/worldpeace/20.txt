Give up the pursuit of knowledge and live in peace
and harmony.

Without knowledge there is no difference
between good and evil.

Is it necessary to learn to fear what others
perceive should be feared? Nonsense!

Other people are excited, joyous and festive
as if enjoying a holiday.
I alone am indifferent, without emotion
or expression; like a baby
before it has learned to smile.

Others have things they feel they need.
I alone own nothing.

I am like a fool unfettered by knowledge.
Other people are intelligent. I alone am ignorant.
Others are shrewd and cunning.
I alone am untouched and moronic.

I aimlessly drift on the great tides of the endless
seas
at the mercy of the indifferent winds.
Others have direction, goals and purposes.
I alone flow within the harmony of Infinity.

I am different from others.
I reside in the peace and harmony of
the Infinite oneness of all things.
