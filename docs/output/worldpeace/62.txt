Infinity is the potential of all things;
the source of all manifestations.

It is the treasure of peaceful people
and the hiding place of the bad.

Flattery can purchase advancement.
Good deeds can obtain admiration.

If a man is bad,
do not distinguish his badness.
See his oneness with humanity.

Therefore, when the king is crowned
and the state officials are sworn in,
do not send them gifts of jade dishes
or a team of four horses.
Instead flow in peace and harmony
and remind them of their oneness
with humanity.

Why does everyone flow in peace and harmony
when they acknowledge the oneness of
Infinity?
Because their needs are met
and their mistakes are not distinguished.

This is the gift of Infinity.
