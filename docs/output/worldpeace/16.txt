Contemplate Infinity and become peaceful as the
mind becomes lost.

The self perceives the never ending
manifestations of
the potential of Infinity as well as the
disintegration
of all those manifestations.

Within Infinity all things manifest
and disintegrate.

Disintegration is a returning to the Infinite
potential.
Disintegration is the destiny of all
manifestations.
Manifesting is the nature of Infinity.
Change is the Infinite constant.

Acknowledging change is the key to understanding
the harmony of never ending change.

Acknowledging change within the Infinite potential
of which every creature is a manifestation,
unique, yet bound to all things in
disintegration,
gives one a perspective regarding life.

Possessing perspective, one becomes impartial,
openhearted, tolerant, compassionate
and indifferent to judging others.
These are foundations of harmony.

The manifestation of the body disintegrates
but Infinity can never disintegrate into
itself.

There is nothing to fear.
