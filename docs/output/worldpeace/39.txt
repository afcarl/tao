All things are at one with Infinity.

When humanity is centered in this oneness:

the sky remains clear and beautiful,
the earth remains pure and sustains life,
the spirit of humanity is in harmony,
the valley is the source of abundance,
all creatures reproduce, regenerate and
replenish the earth,
leaders and kings are in harmony
and nations are at peace.

When humanity focuses on the manifestations of
Infinity,
distinguishes and judges all things
and thereby forgets the oneness of Infinity:

the sky becomes cloudy with pollution,
the earth becomes a cesspool
unable to easily neutralize the many
poisons,
the spirit of humanity becomes confused
and accepts conflict as the nature of
humanity,
the valley no longer produces abundance
and what it does produce is tainted.
Leaders and kings take their nations to war
in order to control the untainted
lands,
creatures no longer reproduce, species die
out
and parts of the earth, unattended by
the myriad creatures, no longer
regenerate or replenish themselves,
the people of all nations live in conflict,
fear, hunger and depression.

Therefore, never forget that oneness is the
essence of harmony; the simple is the way of
peace.

Leaders and kings consider themselves, alone,
ridiculed
and misunderstood when they forget their
oneness with Infinity.

In confusion, they inevitably lead their nations to
war.

In order to maintain peace and harmony in the land,
they must flow in the peace and harmony
of the oneness of all things.

Too much success is a sign that one has
begun to focus on manifestations and
not on Infinity, the essence of all
manifestations.

Do not distinguish precious jade.
Remain centered in the peace and harmony
of the oneness of all things.
