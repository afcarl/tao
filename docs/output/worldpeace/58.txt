When the country is ruled with indifference,
the people flow in peace and harmony.
When the country is ruled with purpose,
the people become tense and circumvent the
law.

When distinctions are made,
good fortune is the harbinger of disaster
and adversity is the foundation of
prosperity.
The only known is change and the limits of
change are unpredictable.

Because everything changes, nothing seems real.
The reliable becomes questionable
and the questionable becomes familiar.

The confusion created by distinctions
is ever present.

Therefore the sage is:
upright but not judgmental,
to the point but not arrogant,
straightforward but not offensive,
is a light but not blinding.
