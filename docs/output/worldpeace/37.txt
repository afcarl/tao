Infinity is the essence of all things.
Without intention, It manifests all things.

If leaders and kings
remain focused on the oneness of Infinity,
nations will flow in peace and harmony.

If leaders and kings are compelled to act,
they should focus on Infinity
and refuse to manifest desire.

If there is no desire for action,
the world would flow in the peace and harmony
of the oneness of Infinity.
