Why are the great oceans the rulers of all rivers?
Because they occupy a lower space.

Therefore, their humility lifts them up.

If the sage is to manifest peace
she must be humble in her speech.

If she is to lead others
she must follow them in harmony.

When the sage leads,
the people do not feel enslaved.
When she stands above them,
they feel at one with her.
Because she is in harmony with others,
they support her and never
consider her a burden.

She is not confused.
Therefore, she does not contend with others
and they do not contend with her.
