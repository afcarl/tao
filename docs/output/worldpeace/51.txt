The potential of Infinity manifests all things.
Manifestations are nourished by oneness,
created with matter,
affected by events.

Therefore, those who maintain peace and harmony
acknowledge Infinity and remember their
oneness,
not because it is demanded,
but because it is the essence of
all things.

Infinity manifests all things,
rears them,
nurtures them,
clothes them,
feeds them,
protects them,
and comforts them.

Infinity manifests all things without possessing
them;
shows them the way without interfering,
assists them without taking credit.

This is the nature of Infinity.
