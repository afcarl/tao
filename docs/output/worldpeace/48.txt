In the pursuit of knowledge,
at every moment something is distinguished.
In the pursuit of peace and harmony,
at every moment something is merged.
Less and less is desired
until one is flowing in peace and harmony.
When one is flowing in peace and harmony
all things are accomplished.

The world flows in peace and harmony
when all things are allowed to
manifest and to disintegrate.

Peace and harmony are sacrificed
by manipulation.
