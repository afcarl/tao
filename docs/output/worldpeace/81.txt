Truthful words are seldom passionate.
Passionate words are seldom truthful.

Peaceful men do not quarrel.
Those who quarrel are confused.

He who is at one with all things
knows Infinity.
He who has knowledge
is always confused.

The sage is never confused by accumulating.
The more he does for others,
the more he flows in harmony.
The more he gives to others,
the more he experiences peace.

Infinity manifests, nourishes and disintegrates
forever.
The sage flows in the peace and harmony
of oneness with all things.
