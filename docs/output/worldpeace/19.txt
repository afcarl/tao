Quit distinguishing the wise and their wisdom,
the saints and their holiness,
and the people will be a hundred times better
off.

Quit distinguishing morality, righteousness and
benevolence
and humanity will stay centered in its
oneness.

Abandon the pursuit of commercial profit
and the number of thieves and robbers will be
greatly reduced.

These are just three impediments to peace and
harmony
and abandoning them is not enough.

Peace and harmony reside in the simplicity
of an uncarved piece of wood.

Quit distinguishing the self and reside in oneness.
Curb your desires and aspirations
and experience the peace and harmony of
simplicity.
