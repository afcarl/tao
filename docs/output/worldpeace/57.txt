Govern a nation with fairness.
In war do the unexpected.
Lead the nation by becoming one with it.

Why do I say this?

Because:

The more rules and regulations,
the more oppressed the citizens.
The more energy used to develop weapons,
the more tension in the land.
The more clever and manipulative the leaders
become,
the more agitated and unpredictable
the population.
The more religious morals and restrictions,
the more depression and self-hatred
manifests.

Therefore,
when the ruler is at one with the population
she says:
I take no action and the citizens
govern themselves.
I flow in peace and harmony
and the people follow in my footsteps.
I refuse to manipulate and control
and the population becomes predictable.
I ignore religion
and tolerance replaces judgment.
