Infinity is oneness.
Infinity is the potential of all things.
All things are one with Infinity.

Distinguishing creates the two.
All things can be distinguished as yin and yang.
The harmony of oneness is achieved by not
distinguishing.

Human beings hate being alone, ridiculed, and
misunderstood.
Yet this is how leaders and kings perceive
themselves
when they forget their oneness with Infinity.

One achieves peace by ignoring distinctions
and becomes confused by endless judgments
and distinctions.

Others teach;
"A violent man will reap a violent death."
I teach;
"All men will die."

This is the simplicity of Infinity.
