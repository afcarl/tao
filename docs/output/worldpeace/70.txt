My words are easy to understand
and easy to put into practice,
but unfortunately few people understand
them or try to live by them.

My thoughts have always existed,
but since people are confused,
they do not embrace them.
Because people do not understand me,
they are confused in conflict and war
rather than living in peace and harmony.

Those that acknowledge their
oneness with Infinity are few.
Those that call me crazy
are applauded by others that are
confused.

Therefore, the sage is modest in her apparel,
but carries the priceless jewel
of peace and harmony in
her heart.
