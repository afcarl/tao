The best leaders are in harmony with their
followers.
The next best are those who are respected.
Then comes those who are feared.
The worst are those who are despised.

If one perceives others as untrustworthy,
then that will be the experience that
one acknowledges.
The selective acknowledgment of
untrustworthiness
verifies one's perception of the
untrustworthiness
of others.

When the leaders are in harmony with their
followers,
few laws are necessary
and all tasks are accomplished with ease.

The followers, not perceiving the
administration
of leadership, marvel at the
manifestations
of harmony and experience a sense of
self worth.
