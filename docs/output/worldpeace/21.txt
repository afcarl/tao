To attain peace and harmony,
stay focused on the oneness of Infinity.

Infinity is the intangible potential of all things;
intangible yet manifesting all images,
intangible yet manifesting all substance.

Within the Infinite void resides the
Infinite potential of all things.
All tangible things are a manifestation of the
Infinite essence.

From the present, forever into the past,
forever into the future,
Infinity is the homogenous essence.
The potential of all things forever manifest
and forever disintegrate within the Infinite.

How can I know the manifestations of Infinity?
Because I am at one with Infinity.
