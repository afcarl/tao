Heaven and earth are indifferent.
All creatures are considered straw dogs;
not distinguished, not judged.

The sage is indifferent.
All people are one;
not distinguished, not judged.

Infinity is like a bellows,
empty yet encompassing the potential
of all things.

In time all potentials manifest.

Words are straw in the wind.
The more one talks, the less one says.

Keep focused on Infinity.
Remain centered in the oneness of
all things.
