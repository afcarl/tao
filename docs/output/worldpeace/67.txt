Everyone says that Infinity is great
but beyond comprehension because it is
intangible.
Since it is intangible, it seems non-existent.
However, if it were not intangible it would
have disintegrated before the world was
born.

Three things create peace and harmony.
The first is a lack of distinctions.
The second is simplicity.
The third is oneness.

With a lack of distinction, I can accept all things.
With simplicity, I do not become confused with
desire.
With oneness, I can be at peace and in harmony
with all things.

In the world people always
make distinctions between good and bad
and become confused in judgment;
desire possessions
and become confused in wealth;
forget their oneness
and live in tension and conflict.

Refuse to make distinctions and refuse to pass
judgment
and war and defense succumb to peace and
harmony.
