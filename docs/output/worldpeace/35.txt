All beings are drawn to those who stay centered
in their oneness with Infinity
because they flow in peace and
harmony.

The manifestations of music and delicious food
catch the attention of those passing by.
But the essence of Infinity goes unnoticed.

It makes no sound and has no flavor
and yet It is the inexhaustible source
of the manifestations of all sounds
and all flavors.
