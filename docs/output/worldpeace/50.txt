From birth to death;
Three in ten are manifesting life,
Three in ten are disintegrating into death,
and three in ten are between,
manifesting life and disintegrating
into death.

Why?
Because the vast majority of humanity
distinguishes life and death.

The person who is at one with all things
can go anywhere without fear of
vicious animals or dangerous persons.

Why?
Because she is at one with the wild animals,
they perceive her as themselves.
Because she is at one with dangerous
persons,
they fear her.
