The oneness of the five colors blind the eyes.
The oneness of the five tones deafens the ears.
The oneness of the five flavors dull the tongue.

Racing ahead of change
and pursuing the illusion of reality
promotes confusion.

Therefore, the sage is in harmony with what she is
and does not distinguish what she sees.

She chooses oneness and distinguishes nothing.
