Your name or your self: which is more important?
Your self or your possessions: which are more
valuable?
Gain or loss: which is more destructive to
peace and harmony?

He who values his name separates from the
oneness of humanity and experiences
suffering.
Accumulating always creates confusion.
A man in harmony does not distinguish gain or loss.

A man who refuses to judge or make distinctions
will never become lost or confused.
He will experience peace and harmony within
the oneness of Infinity.
