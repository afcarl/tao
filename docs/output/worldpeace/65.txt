From time immemorial the sage has not
tried to teach oneness
but has embedded peace and harmony
in the openness of a simple life.

Why is it so hard to rule?
Because people are at one with their
leaders.
Leaders who use cleverness
are confronted with more cleverness.
Cleverness only manifests confusion.

Those who flow in the peace and harmony of
oneness
lead without attempting cleverness
and are a blessing to everyone.

These too are distinctions,
cleverness and non-action.

Realizing these two are distinctions
focuses one on the oneness of Infinity
and away from confusion.

Staying centered in the oneness that permeates
Infinity
manifests peace and harmony.
