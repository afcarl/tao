Exalting people creates the desire in others
to be exalted and therefore creates tension.

Overvaluing goods creates the desire for
ownership
and therefore creates the temptation to
steal.

When people do not distinguish things as valuable,
they remain focused on the oneness of all
things
and do not become confused in the material
world.

Therefore, harmonious leaders empty the people's
minds
but nourish their bodies.
They undermine desires
and improve endurance.

They keep the people focused on their oneness with
Infinity
and free them from attachments to material
things.

They redirect the energies of those
who would manipulate others.

If you remember your oneness with Infinity,
and flow with life by refusing to distinguish
good and bad,
you will flow in the peace and harmony
that is the essence of Infinity.
