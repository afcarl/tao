Those who live in oneness manifest the Infinite
in simple ways.

Their awareness is the awareness of Infinity.
Their knowing cannot be described but only
experienced.
All that can be described is their acts and their
appearance and the perception of them.

They are;
alert when crossing unfamiliar space,
cautious in hostile lands,
humble as a guest,
indifferently transforming as melting ice,
possessing the infinite potential of
an unremarkable piece of uncarved
wood,
mysterious as an unexplored valley,
perplexing as muddy water.

Can you see the calm in turbulent waters;
the clarity in murky water?

Can you allow the tides of Infinite change
to move you from stillness to motion
and action to inaction;
experiencing but not contemplating the
change?

Those who live in oneness do not seek
fullness because at every moment they
are aware of their infinite fullness and
the infinite pregnancy of all things.

They are aware of their infinite potential
within which the limitations of fullness
resides.
