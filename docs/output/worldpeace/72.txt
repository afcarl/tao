When people are not in awe of the Infinite,
they are overwhelmed by confusion.

Do not violate another's space.
Do not interfere with another's livelihood.

If you do not violate their space
or interfere with their livelihood,
they will not separate
themselves
from you.

The sage acknowledges herself but
does not distinguish herself
from others.

She lives her reality
but does not try to foist it on others.

She makes her choices
but is indifferent and unattached
and therefore lives in peace and
harmony.
