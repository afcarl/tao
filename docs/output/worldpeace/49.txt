The sage has no mind of her own.
She is at one with all of humanity.

Give to those who are considered good.
Give to those who are considered bad.
This is true oneness.

Trust those who are trustworthy.
Trust those who are not trustworthy.
This is also true oneness.

The sage is peaceful and harmonious;
but to the world she seems indifferent.

The world pays attention to her and listens to her
even though she resembles a child.
