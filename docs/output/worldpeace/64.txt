Peace and harmony are easy to perpetuate.
Situations are easy to deal with before
they manifest.
The brittle is easily cracked.
The small is easy to broadcast.

Flow in peace and harmony and problems do
not manifest.
Focus on the oneness of all things
and avoid confusion.

The greatest tree manifests from an
unremarkable shoot.
A multilevel building begins with
the laying of a single brick.
A journey of a thousand miles begins
with a single step.

He who attempts to control his life becomes
confused.
Attempt to grasp a thing and it disappears.
The sage flows in peace and harmony
and so is not confused.
She attaches herself to nothing and
consequently her vision remains clear.

Confused people usually quit just short of
success.
Therefore, see experiences as
the oneness of life from beginning to end
and it will be impossible to fail.

The sage is indifferent to desire:
she does not accumulate possessions,
she is unemotional regarding ideas,
she focuses people on their oneness,
she, by example, illuminates
the path to peace and harmony
but does not impose her will
or foist her views on
others.
