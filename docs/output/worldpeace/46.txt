When the world remembers its oneness,
horses plow the fields.
When the world focuses on the manifestations of
Infinity,
distinctions, judgment and war replace peace
and harmony.

There is no greater confusion than desire;
no greater burden than discontent.
Nothing is as unfortunate as seeing one's self
as separate from others.

Peace and harmony come from the realization
that what one has is enough.
