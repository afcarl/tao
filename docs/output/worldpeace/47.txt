Because you are at one with Infinity,
you can experience the world without
leaving your home.
Without looking out the window
you can see the manifestations of Infinity.
The further you carry your distinctions
and your judgments,
the more confused and lost you become.

Thus the sage experiences all things
without traveling;
without looking she sees Infinity.

She works without laboring.
