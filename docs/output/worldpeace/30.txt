Whenever you have an opportunity to advise a
leader
regarding Infinity, advise her not to use
force
to try to gain control of the world.

Why?

Because force attracts resistance
and the greater the force
the greater the resistance.

Briars grow where armies have been
and hard times are the legacy of a great war.

Conclude hostilities as soon as possible
and do not continue to use excessive force
after victory.

Fulfill your purpose but never glory in inhumane
acts.
Fulfill your purpose but never boast of
bloodletting.
Fulfill your purpose but never take pride in
killing.
Fulfill your purpose but avoid violence.
Fulfill your purpose by flowing within
the oneness of Infinity.

The use of force dissipates life.
Force is not the way of peace and harmony.
That which goes against peace and harmony
is short lived.
