When the oneness of Infinity is forgotten,
judgment appears and people are
distinguished as good and righteous.

When the illusion of knowledge and understanding
appear,
the physical reality has been confused with
Infinity.

When there is no peace and harmony within the
family,
a facade of devotion and obedience is
perceived.

When a nation manifests great change,
patriots step forward
to attempt to resurrect the past.
