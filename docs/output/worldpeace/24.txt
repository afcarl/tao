Stand on your toes and you will not maintain your
balance.
Run and you will have to rest.

Keep a harmonious pace
and you can circumnavigate the earth.

Draw attention to yourself and others may
consider you a fool.
Become self-righteous and others will avoid you.
Boasting impresses no one.
Brag and you may be put to the test.

Within the oneness of Infinity,
all these are delusions of the physical
world.
They do not bring peace and harmony.
Be at one with Infinity and keep these in
perspective.
They are transient excesses in a transient
universe.
