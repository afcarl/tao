If you accept all things by refusing to distinguish
good and bad,
you overcome the confusion of the physical
reality
and live in harmony with the Infinite
manifestations.

If you bend as you are impacted by manifestations,
your path of peace and harmony
will remain straight and true.

If you empty your mind of knowledge,
you will fill with the experience
of oneness with the Infinite.

All manifestations constantly disintegrate and
remanifest.
As your body wears out, your spirit is
reborn.

Possess little in goods and thoughts and
maintain your vision of oneness with
Infinity.

Possess much and become lost in the confusion
that the physical reality is the true reality.

Therefore, remain focused on the oneness of
Infinity
and become a beacon for all beings.

Do not distinguish the self
and manifest the oneness of Infinity for all
to see.

Do not assert the self and others will follow.

Do not bolster the self and other will give their
respect.

Do not allow the self to brag
and others will bestow their praise.

Do not allow the self to be quarrelsome
and experience peace with all beings.

Is not it true that if you accept all things
by refusing to distinguish good and bad,
you overcome the confusion of the physical
reality and live in harmony with
the Infinite manifestations?

Flow with the peace and harmony of the oneness
of Infinity and experience immortality.
