Water is like Infinity,
it gives itself to all things
without distinction or judgment
and settles into the lowest places
without deliberation.

In dwelling, live in harmony with the land.
In meditation, remember your oneness with the
Infinite.
In dealing with others, do not judge.
In communicating, relate the truth.
In governing, be fair.
In daily life, be in harmony with all things
and at peace with all people.
In action, be mindful that there is a time
and a season for all things.

Avoid judging and its legacy contention
and flow in the peace and harmony
of the oneness of humanity.
