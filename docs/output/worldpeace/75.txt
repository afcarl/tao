When the people of a nation are starving
and without the basic necessities,
it is because taxes are excessive.

When the people of a nation are rebellious,
it is because the laws are out of
harmony with the population.

When the leaders of a nation are oppressive
in their confusion,
the people remember their oneness
and become indifferent to death.

Those who remember the oneness of Infinity
are indifferent to life and death
and consequently live in peace
and harmony.
