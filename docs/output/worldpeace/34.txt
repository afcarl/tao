Infinity permeates everything in every direction;
to the left as well as to the right.
It is the potential of all things,
and the manifestation of all things.
Its total essence resides in all things.

It has no purpose.
It is complete in its indifference.
It manifests and disintegrates all things forever.

It sustains all things,
yet it is the god of no thing.
It has no purpose.
It is Infinitely insignificant.

All manifestations after a time disintegrate back
into It,
yet It is the god of no thing.

It permeates everything
and so there is nothing outside its realm.

It cannot appear great
because it is at one with everything.
