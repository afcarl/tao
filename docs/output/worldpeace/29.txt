Do you think you can control the world?
I do not believe it can be done.

The world is a manifestation of change
and cannot be controlled.

If you try to control it, you will end up deceiving
yourself.
If you treat it like an object, it will overwhelm
you.

The world is a manifestation of change;
sometimes ahead, sometimes behind,
sometimes dynamic, sometimes static,
sometimes vigorous, sometimes feeble,
sometimes manifesting, sometimes
disintegrating.

Therefore, refuse to distinguish excesses and
extremes.
See only oneness.
Flow with Infinity
and exist in peace and harmony.
