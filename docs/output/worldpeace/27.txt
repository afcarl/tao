A proficient traveler leaves no evidence of his
journey.
A proficient speaker is impeccable in his
presentation.
A proficient accountant needs no tally sheet.
A functional door has no lock
but can only opened by the owner.
A perfect binding has no knots
yet only the binder can loosen it.

The sage is the light of all human beings
and rejects no one.
She efficiently uses all things
and discards nothing.
This is called manifesting Infinity.

What is a sage but a guide to peace and harmony?
What is a materialistic traveler but the
sage's focus?

For the student not to value the teacher
or the teacher not to love the student
or for the followers not to acknowledge the
leader
or the leader not to care for the
followers,
is the cause of great confusion.

This is a key to peace and harmony,
teachers and leaders remind others of who
they are
and their oneness with Infinity.
