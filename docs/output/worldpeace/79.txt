Conflict almost always leaves some resentment
regardless of the nature of a peaceful
resolution.

How does one achieve peace and harmony?
The sage fulfills her commitments
but does not demand others to fulfill theirs.

Those who are confused
demand others to fulfill their commitments
but are unconcerned with fulfilling
their own.

Infinity is indifferent.
It is at one with all people.
