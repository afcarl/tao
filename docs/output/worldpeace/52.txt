Infinity is the mother of all things.
Remembering Infinity, one knows
the nature of children.
Knowing the nature of the children
keeps one focused on the oneness of
Infinity.

Remembering your oneness with Infinity
and the immortality of Infinity
overcomes the fear of death.

Contemplate Infinity,
accept all things without distinctions and
judgments,
and life will be peaceful and
harmonious.

Think about reality,
distinguish and judge all things,
and life degenerates into confusion.

Seeing differences is called distinguishing.
Remaining indifferent manifests peace and
harmony.

Understanding the nature of oneness
focuses one on Infinity
and away from the confusion of
misfortune.
This is called abiding in the constant.
