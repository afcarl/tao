Nothing in the world is more submissive and
yielding
than water.
Yet nothing can equal it in cutting the inflexible
and eroding the hard.

The weak can subdue the strong
and the flexible outlasts the rigid.
This is common knowledge,
yet only a very few can practice it.

Therefore, the sages say;
She who is at one with the
disgrace of a nation
is worthy to be queen.

He who is at one with the
misfortunes of nations
is worthy to be king of kings.

The truth frequently seems paradoxical.
