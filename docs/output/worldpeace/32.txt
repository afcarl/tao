Infinity can never be defined in words.
Smaller than an atom, greater than forever,
it can never be comprehended.

If kings would stay centered in the Infinite,
they would not try to control the
uncontrollable;

Heaven and earth would be seen as a manifestation
of the oneness of Infinity,
as harmonious as dew accumulating on the
ground.

The people would recognize Infinity manifesting
in their king and all things would be
in harmony.

When the whole is distinguished into parts,
and parts into more parts
and more parts into even more parts
a myriad names are required.

There are already too many distinctions and
names.

The naming of things focuses on the manifestations
of Infinity
and too much distinguishing can result in one
becoming confused in the manifestations and
oblivious to
the oneness of all things.

Refuse to distinguish the components of the whole.
See the oneness of Infinity,
and see the earth as a manifestation
disintegrating back into Infinity.
