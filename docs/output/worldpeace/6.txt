The manifestations of Infinity never cease
manifesting.

Infinity is the primal creator, the oneness of male
and female.

Infinity is the gate though which heaven
and earth manifested.

It is invisible to the senses,
yet totally permeates all things.

It is inexhaustible and eternally available
for any purpose.
