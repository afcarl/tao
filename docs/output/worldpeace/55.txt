A person who flows in peace and harmony
is like a newborn baby.
Poisonous insects and reptiles do not sting or
bite it.
Wild animals do not stalk it.
Raptors do not attack it.

Its bones are soft and it muscles are weak
yet its grip is secure.
It is not aware of male and female
yet its genitals are aroused.
Its oneness is perfect.
It screams all day without becoming hoarse.
This is the perfection of harmony.

Knowing harmony is acknowledging
the oneness of Infinity.
Knowing the oneness of Infinity is the
experience of peace.

Manipulating one's life force results in confusion.
Controlling the breath interrupts the harmony of
the body.
Increasing the natural pace of life creates
exhaustion
and is therefore not the path of harmony.

Anything that remains out of harmony is short
lived.
