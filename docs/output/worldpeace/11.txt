Thirty spokes converge on the wheel's hub.
But the center hole which receives the axle
makes it useful.

Clay is shaped into a pot.
But the inner space which receives whatever
one puts into it makes it useful.

Wood is cut and joined to build a house.
But the windows and doors which allow
things to enter and leave make it
useful.

The potential utility resides in the tangible.
But true usefulness is a manifestation of
the intangible.
