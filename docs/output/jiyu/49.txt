The sage has no fixed personal will,
He regards the people's will as his own.
I take the people's will, if it is good, as good.
I take the people's will, if it is not good, as good too.
Thus goodness is attained.
I believe the people's will, if it is believable.
I also believe the people's will, even if it is unbelievable.
Thus faith is attained.
The sage dwells under Heaven, harmoniously keeping all the people under Heaven in confusion,
(While all the people concentrate upon their own eyes and ears),
Thus the sage treats them all as ignorant infants without desires.
