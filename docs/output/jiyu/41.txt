When the highest shi hear Tao, they diligently practice it.
When the average shi hear Tao, they half believe it.
When the lowest shi hear Tao, (thinking it empty) they laugh greatly at it.
If they didn't laugh, it would be contrary to Tao.
Therefore there are some old sayings:
"The Tao that is bright seems to be dark;
The Tao that goes forward seems to retreat;
The Tao that is level seems to be uneven;
The lofty De (Virtue) looks like a humble valley;
The greatest glory looks like disgrace;
The greatest De looks insufficient;
The vigorous De looks inert;
The simple purity looks changeable;
The great square has no corners;
The valuable vessel is always completed lastly;
The greatest sound sounds faint;
The greatest form looks formless."
Tao is hidden and nameless,
It is only Tao that initiates all beings and brings them to completion.
