What is most perfect seems to be incomplete,
But its utility cannot be impaired.
What is most full seems to be empty,
But its utility cannot be exhausted.
The most straight seems to be crooked,
The greatest skill seems to be clumsy,
The greatest eloquence seems to stammer.
Rapid walking overcomes cold,
Being quiet overcomes heat.
By remaining quiet and tranquil, one will be the chief under Heaven.
