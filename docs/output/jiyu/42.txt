Tao gives birth to the unified thing (One),
The One splits itself into two opposite aspects (Two),
The Two gives birth to another (Three),
The newborn Third produces a myriad of things.
The myriad of things contain the Yin and Yang within themselves as opposite forces,
Both of them (Yin and Yang) are unified with harmony in the invisible breath.
People disdain the "orphaned," "solitary" or "unworthy,"
And yet they are the very names by which kings and dukes call themselves.
Therefore all things may increase when purposely diminished,
And they may diminish when increased.
What people teach each other, I also teach:
"The violent and strong does not die his natural death,"
I will make that fact the beginning of my teaching.
