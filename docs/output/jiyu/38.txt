The superior virtue does not show itself in formal virtue,
In this way it really possesses virtue.
The inferior virtue rigidly sticks to formal virtue,
In this way it loses virtue.
The superior virtue takes no action to show itself, and need not do so purposefully.
The inferior virtue takes action to show itself, and does so purposefully.
The superior benevolence takes action to show itself, and does so on purpose.
The superior righteousness takes action to show itself, and does so on purpose.
The superior propriety takes action to show itself,
And when it gets no response, it will stretch its arms and retaliate.
Therefore, only when Tao is lost does De arise,
Only when De is lost does benevolence arise,
Only when benevolence is lost does righteousness arise,
Only when righteousness is lost does propriety arise.
The thing that is called propriety is really the want of loyalty and faithfulness and the beginning of disorder.
The thing that is called foresight is really the ornament of Tao and the beginning of ignorance.
For this reason the great man dwells in the thick and keeps away from the thin,
He dwells in plainness and keeps away from the ornament.
Therefore he rejects the latter and accepts the former.
