Only when sageness and wisdom are discarded, can the people benefit;
Only when benevolence and righteousness are discarded, can the people return to filial piety and parental affection;
Only when skill and profit are discarded, can there be thieves and robbers no more.
These three (negative principles) are, however inadequate as a doctrine.
Therefore (as a positive instruction) we shall put people's understanding under this (guidance):
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and hold few desires.
