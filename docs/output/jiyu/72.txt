When the people do not fear the force (of the ruler),
Something forceful and terrible would happen.
Don't force the people out of their houses,
Don't block their way of livelihood.
Only by not oppressing the people, can one make the people feel no oppression.
Therefore the sage seeks for self-knowledge, not for self-parade, for self-love, not for self-importance.
So, self-parade and self-importance should be abandoned and self-knowledge and self-love should be kept.
