The content of the great "De" (Virtue) is in conformity with Tao.
The thing that is called Tao has no definite form.
So vague and elusive is it,
Yet in it the real exists.
So profound and obscure is it,
Yet in it the subtle essence was contained.
The essence is very concrete, and very real.
From the old time till now, its name stands unworn, by which we may know the beginnings of all things.
How do I know their beginnings?
Only by this (nature of Tao).
