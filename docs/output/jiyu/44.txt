Which is more dear to me, credit or life?
Which is more valuable, life or wealth?
Which is more harmful, gain or loss?
Therefore the excessive stint must cause enormous expenses,
The rich hoard must suffer a serious loss.
Whoever is contented will meet no disgrace,
Whoever knows when and where to stop will meet no danger,
And he is able to endure long without worry.
