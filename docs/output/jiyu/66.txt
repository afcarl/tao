The rivers and seas can become the masters of many streams just because they skillfully stay in lower valleys.
So they can be the leaders of many streams.
Therefore (he) who wants to rule over the people should show his modesty by his words.
He who wants to lead the people should place himself behind them.
In this way, the sage is above the people, but the people do not feel him as a burden.
He is in front of the people (leading them), but the people do not feel him as a hindrance.
Therefore all the people under Heaven revere him and do not tire of him.
Just because he does not compete with others,
Nobody under Heaven can compete with him.
