A master in the art of war is very correct in saying:
"I dare not take the offensive, but prefer to take the defensive;
I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot."
This is called:
Disposing no lines of troops,
Raising no arms,
Confronting no enemy,
And grasping no weapons.
There is no disaster greater than underestimating the enemy,
Underestimating the enemy nearly makes me lose my "three precious things."
Therefore the side in grief conquers in case of the balance of the forces of two sides.
