Does not he Way (Tao) of Heaven resemble drawing a bow (and aiming an arrow at the target)?
When it is high, it will be brought down;
When it is low, it will be raised up;
When it is overfull, it will be diminished;
And when it is not full, it will be supplemented.
It is the Way of Heaven to diminish the excessive, so as to supplement the deficient.
This is not so with the Way of man -
It takes away from those who have not enough so as to supply those who have superabundance.
Who can supply all the people under Heaven by diminishing the excessive?
Only the man who has "Tao."
Therefore the sage promotes all things, but does not think the effort as his own,
Achieves merit, but does not claim credit for himself,
And does not wish to parade his wisdom and ability.
