The profundity of De contained should be compared to an ignorant infant without desires,
Whom poisonous insects will not sting,
Whom fierce brutes will not seize,
Whom birds of prey will not attack;
Whose bones are weak and whose sinews are soft, but whose grasp is firm;
Who does not yet know about intercourse of male and female but whose virile member may be excited, because it is full of physical essence;
Who cries all day long without its throat becoming hoarse, because it is peaceful and without desires.
To know the peace is called the eternal,
To know the eternal is called wisdom.
The desire for life enjoyment is a disaster,
And to subject physical essence to desire is to boast of powerfulness.
Things begin to become old when they have grown strong, which may be said to be contrary to Tao.
Contrariness to Tao brings death with it very soon.
