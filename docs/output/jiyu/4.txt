Tao is invisible, but its usefulness cannot be exhausted.
It is so fathomless, like the ancestor of all things.
It covers its cutting edge,
It transcends entanglement,
It contains its light,
It mixes with its dust.
It has no form or image, but actually it exists.
I don't know where it was born of,
(I only know) it appeared before the Lord.
