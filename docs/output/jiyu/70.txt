My words are very easy to understand, and very easy to practice.
But no one under Heaven is able to understand them or to practice them.
Speeches should have their main principle,
And deeds should have their master.
Because of their ignorance, the people are not able to understand me.
Those who are able to understand me are very few,
And those who are able to follow me are very heard to meet.
Therefore the sage (who is not understood) looks like he is wearing coarse grab, but he has a precious jade in his heart.
