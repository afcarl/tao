From of old those that attained one principle (Tao)-
Heaven attained the One and became clear,
Earth attained the One and became tranquil,
Spirits attained the One and became divine,
Valleys attained the One and became full,
All things attained the One and became luxuriant,
Kings and princes attained the One and became heads of the kingdom.
What they strove to achieve was fulfilled by the principle (the One).
If Heaven couldn't have become clear it would soon crack.
If Earth couldn't have become tranquil it would soon be shaken.
If spirits couldn't have become divine they would soon perish.
If valleys couldn't have become luxuriant they would soon be extinct.
If kings and princes couldn't have maintained their majesty and nobility they would soon lose their kingdoms and states.
Therefore the noble takes the humble as it root,
And the high takes the low as its ground.
Just for this reason kings and princes call themselves the orphaned, the solitary and the unworthy.
Is it not regarding the humble as the root of the noble?
Is it not so?
Therefore to seek too much honour means to lose honour wholly.
So neither the noble jade, nor the humble rocks should one strive to be.
