Refrain from exalting capable men, so that the people shall not compete.
Refrain from valuing rare goods, so that the people shall not steal.
Refrain from displaying anything which arouses desires, so that the people's hearts will not be disturbed.
Therefore the government of (under Heaven) the sage lies in:
Simplifying the people's minds,
Filling their bellies,
Weakening their ambitions,
Strengthening their bones,
And always keeping the people innocent of knowledge and desires.
(Thus) anyone who thinks himself clever is afraid of meddling.
By handling affairs on the principle of nonaction everyone will do well.
