A state should be governed in a natural way,
A war should be prosecuted in an unusual way,
And the kingdom should be controlled by doing nothing.
How do I know that it is so?
On the grounds:
In the kingdom the more prohibitive enactments there are, the poorer the people become;
The more weapons the people have, the greater disorder the state and clan fall into;
The more crafts and technics men possess, the more strange contrivances appear;
The more display of statutes there is, the more robbers and thieves there are.
So the sage said:
"I do nothing, then the people submit spontaneously,
I am fond of keeping still, then the people are righteous spontaneously,
I take no trouble, and the people naturally enrich themselves,
I have no desires, then the people naturally remain in primitive simplicity."
