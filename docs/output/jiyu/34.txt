The great Tao is like a river overflowing,
It can go left, it can go right.
All things owe their existence to it,
But it never interferes with them.
When its work is accomplished, it is unable to say where its credit is.
It protects and nourishes, but it does not claim to be master over them.
Always without its desire, it may be called small.
All things come to it as their home,
And yet it does not pose as their master.
It may be called great.
It is precisely because it never claims to be great, that it can achieve its greatness.
