He who knows the masculine but keeps to the feminine, is ready to be the ravine under Heaven.
Being the ravine under Heaven, he is not parted from constant "De" (Virtue),
He returns to the simple state, like an infant.
He who knows the white (glory) but keeps to the black (obscure), is ready to be the (divination) instrument of under Heaven.
Being the instrument of under Heaven, he rests upon constant "De,"
He returns to the ultimate truth.
He who knows glory but keeps to disgrace, is ready to be the valley under Heaven.
Being the valley under Heaven, he will have plenty of the eternal "De,"
He returns to simplicity.
When the simplicity is broken up, it is turned into concrete vessels.
By using the breaking up of simplicity, the sage sets up government and leadership.
Therefore the perfect government does not arise out of artificiality.
