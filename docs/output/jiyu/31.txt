Weapons are instruments of evil,
They are disdained by everyone.
Therefore those who possess Tao stay away from them.
When at home jun-zi honours the left;
When at war he honours the right.
Weapons are the instruments of evil, not the instruments of jun-zi.
When he uses them unavoidably, he maintains an indifferent attitude.
Even when he is victorious, he doesn't think himself praiseworthy.
If he praises his victory, he is a man delighting in the slaughter of people.
He who delights in the slaughter of people will not succeed under Heaven.
On happy occasions, the left is honoured.
On unhappy occasions, the right is honoured.
The lieutenant-general stands on the left,
The senior general stands on the right.
That is to say that the arrangement of war affairs follows that of funeral ceremonies.
The war will slaughter the multitude of people.
So we should go to the battleground with sorrow and grief.
Even if it is won, we observe the occasion with funeral ceremonies.
