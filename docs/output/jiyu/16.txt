Try the utmost to make the heart vacant,
Be sure to hold fast to quietude.
All things are growing and developing,
And I see thereby their cycles.
Though all things flourish with a myriad of variations,
Each one will eventually return to its roots.
This return to its root means "tranquility,"
It is called "returning to its destiny."
"To return to its destiny" is called "the eternal,"
To know "the eternal" is called "enlightenment."
Not to know "the eternal" and to act blindly (will necessarily) result in disaster.
Only knowing "the eternal" can one embrace all,
Only embracing all can one be impartial.
Being impartial means you can be all-encompassing under Heaven,
By being all-encompassing under Heaven, you can be one with Nature.
Being one with Nature is in accord with Tao,
Being in accord with Tao is everlasting,
And so you can be free from danger throughout your life.
