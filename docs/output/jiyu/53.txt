If I have a certain knowledge,
I will go along the highway (Great Tao),
And I will be afraid on nothing but the oblique way.
The highway is very even,
But the people are fond of the shortcut.
(Those who make) the palace very clear and neat, the field uncultivated and weedy, the granary empty and vacant, wearing glorious and coloured clothes, carrying precious and sharp swords, satiated with exquisite food and drink, possessing an abundance of wealth and property, can be called chieftain to robbers.
That is contrary to rationality (Tao).
