The heavy is the root of the light,
The tranquil is the master of the hasty,
Therefore the sage travels all day, without leaving his baggage wagon.
Although enjoying a magnificent and comfortable life, he does not indulge himself in it.
How is it that a lord of ten thousand chariots belittles his own importance under Heaven?
Lightness necessarily leads to the loss of Root,
Hastiness necessarily results in the loss of mastery.
