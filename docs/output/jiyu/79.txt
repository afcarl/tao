When an attempt has been made to reconcile two sides in a great enmity, and there is surely some enmity remaining,
How can this be a good thing?
So, although the sage hold the counterfoil of receipt,
He does not force the debtor to pay back.
The moral man is as calm and unhurried as a bookkeeper is,
And the immoral man is as calculating as a rent collector is (while he is collecting the rent).
The Tao of Heaven has no partiality for any reason, and always helps the good man.
