A great state lies lower (like rivers and seas into which all streams run),
To it all things under Heaven tend,
It considers itself as the female under Heaven.
The female always overcomes the male by stillness, because it is still and lies lower.
Therefore, a great state can, by lowering itself to small states, make the small states rely upon the big states.
Small states can, by lowering themselves to a great state, win trust from it.
Thus a great state sometimes makes small states rely upon it by lowering itself.
And sometimes, small states win the trust from a great state only by lowering themselves.
What the great state desires is to lead the small states,
And what the small states desire is to serve the great state.
Then each side gets what it desires,
But the great state should especially learn to lower itself.
