The softest thing under Heaven is able to run in and out of the hardest.
The invisible force is able to penetrate that in which there is no crevice.
Thereby I come to know the advantage of doing nothing.
The instructiveness of not speaking and the benefits of nonaction are incomparable under Heaven.
