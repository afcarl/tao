There was something undifferentiated and yet complete, which existed before Heaven and Earth.
Soundless and formless, it depends upon nothing external, operating in a circular motion ceaselessly.
It may be considered the root (Mother) of all beings under Heaven.
I don't know its name,
And call it Tao.
Inadequately giving it another name, I call it great.
The Great moves on,
The moving-on become remote,
The remote returns to the original point.
Therefore the Tao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
And Man is also great.
There are four great things in the universe,
And Man is one of them.
Man follows the way of Earth,
Earth follows the way of Heaven,
Heaven follow the way of Tao,
Tao follows the way of itself.
