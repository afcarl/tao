Whoever holds fast to the great image will become that one to whom all people under Heaven will come.
(Even if all people under Heaven) come to him they will not hinder each other,
And all enjoy comfort, peace and health.
Music and dainties will make passing guests stop,
(But) Tao, if spoken out, will be insipid and tasteless.
Being looked at, it is imperceptible,
Being listened to, it is inaudible,
Being utilized, it is inexhaustible.
