Consider nonaction as and action, having no trouble as an affair and flavourless as a flavour.
No matter how hostile others are toward me,
I always repay them with "De."
Prepare for a difficult problem while it is easy,
Enter on a great task while it is still small.
All the difficult things under Heaven necessarily arise from the state in which they were easy;
All the great tasks under Heaven arise from the state in which they were small.
For this reason, the sage never does great things,
And he can accomplish great things just on that account.
Light promising makes on lose one's credit,
And thinking things easy leads to difficulties.
So, the sage, though he is very wise, pays much attention to the difficulties,
Therefore he is free from difficulties in the end.
