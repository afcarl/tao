Abandon learning and there will be no sorrow.
How much difference is there between approval and denouncement?
How much difference is there between good and evil?
What others fear cannot but be feared.
It has been so from times of old and the practice doesn't seem to end.
The multitude are so merry, as though going for a great banquet or ascending a height with a broad view in springtime.
I alone am indifferent, with no concern, like an infant that cannot laugh, wearied, indeed, as if I have no home to go to.
The multitude all have more than enough,
I alone seem to lack everything.
My mind is that of a stupid man totally in a muddle.
Common people are so brilliant,
I alone seem to be in the dark.
Common people are so demanding,
I alone seem to be tolerant: so broad and as the boundless sea, so vigorous as the untiring blowing wind.
The multitude have their ability,
I alone seem to be clumsy and incapable.
I alone differ from others, essentially because I have acquired Tao.
