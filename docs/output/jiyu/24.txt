He who wants to stand higher on tiptoe is not steady;
He who wants to double his step is unable to hasten;
He who only rests on his own eyes cannot see clearly;
He who considers himself always in the right cannot tell right from wrong;
He who boasts himself will be given no credit;
He who considers himself superior is not qualified for leadership.
From the point of Tao, (all these) are nothing but remnants of food and tumours of action, which all creatures detest.
Therefore those who possess Tao will stay away from them.
