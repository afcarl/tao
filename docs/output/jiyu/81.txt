Sincere words are not fine,
Fine words are not sincere.
A good man is not eloquent,
An eloquent man is not good.
He who knows does not show off his learning,
He who shows off his learning does not know.
The sage has nothing to reserve.
He gains more since he does his utmost to help others,
And gets richer since he gives all to others.
The Tao of Heaven is beneficial to all things, but not harmful.
The Tao of the sage is to compete against nobody in what he does.
