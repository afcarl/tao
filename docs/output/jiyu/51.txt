Tao begets all beings,
And De fosters them.
The physical gives them forms,
And the vessels mark them accomplished.
Therefore all beings without exception venerate Tao and value De.
The veneration of Tao and valuing De, is not out of obedience to any orders, but is always like this.
Therefore Tao begets all beings,
And De fosters them, grows and raises them, makes them fruitful and mature, breeds them and protects them.
To give birth to them without taking possession of them,
To put them in motion without vaunting this as its merits,
And to be their sovereign without controlling them,
- These are called the profound De.
