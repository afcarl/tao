One who is skilled at travelling leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps;
One who is skilled at speaking says nothing that can be found fault with;
One who is skilled at counting uses no tallies;
One who is skilled as closing needs no bolts, while it is impossible to open what he has shut.
One who is skilled at binding has no strings, while it is impossible to undo what he has bound.
Therefore the sage is always skillful at saving men,
And so no man is uselessly cast away.
This is called the hidden wisdom.
Therefore the good man is the teacher of the bad,
And the bad man is the material from which the good man learns.
He who does not honour his teacher and who does not greatly care for the material is greatly confused though he thinks himself wise.
Such is called yao-miao (subtle).
