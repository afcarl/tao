Tao has no name forever.
Though the simplicity seems small, it may be subordinated to nothing under Heaven.
If kings and princes can preserve it, all creatures would submit of themselves to them.
(Yin and Yang between) Heaven and Earth unite to drip sweet dew.
Without the command of the people, it drips evenly over all.
Once there was government, there were names appearing.
Once there were names, one has to know where and when to stop.
By practicing moderation one can be free from danger.
Everything under Heaven is embraced by Tao, just like every river or stream running into the sea.
