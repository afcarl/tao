Heaven is eternal and Earth everlasting.
Heaven and Earth can be eternal and everlasting because they don't exist for themselves,
And for this reason they obtain longevity.
Therefore the sage puts himself last,
But actually he stands foremost.
He has no regard for himself,
But his life is well preserved.
Is it not because he has no personal interests that his private ends are fulfilled?
