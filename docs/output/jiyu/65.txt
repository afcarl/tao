From of old those who have carried out the principle of Tao do not enlighten the people with it, but make them foolish and simple with it.
What makes it difficult to govern the people is that they have too much knowledge,
Therefore to govern the state by wisdom is a disaster for the state,
And not to govern the state by wisdom is a blessing for the state.
It is a principle to now the two (by wisdom and not by wisdom).
Carrying out the principle forever is called the mysterious "De."
The mysterious "De" is very deep and far-reaching.
It is contrary to the nature of concrete things,
But leads to the greatest conformity.
