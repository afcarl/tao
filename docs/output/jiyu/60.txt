Governing a great state is like frying a small fish (so frequent disturbance should be avoided).
Applying Tao to the kingdom can render ghosts harmless.
It is not that ghosts cannot function,
But that the function cannot harm men,
It is not that the function cannot harm men,
But that the sage never harms men at all.
So, men and ghosts will not harm each other,
Therefore both (men and ghosts) praise the De of the sage.
