When all the people in the world know the beautiful as beauty,
There appears ugliness;
When they know goodness as good,
There appears evil.
Therefore, by opposing each other,
Existence and non-existence come into being,
Difficult and easy form themselves,
Long and short are distinct,
High and low contrast,
Sound and voice harmonize,
Front and back emerge.
Thus, the sage manages affairs by "nonaction,"
And teaches by "saying nothing."
He leaves all things to grow and change without initiation;
Raises all things without making claim for his ownership;
Promotes all things without attributing them to his contribution;
And takes no credit for himself when the work is done.
It is because no claim is made that his credit cannot be forfeited.
