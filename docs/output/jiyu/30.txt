He who assists the rulers with Tao does not dominate under Heaven by force.
The use of force will soon incur requital.
Wherever armies are stationed, briers and thorns grow wild.
Great wars are always followed by famines.
Content yourself with your success and stop.
Do not seek to dominate under Heaven by force of arms.
Succeed but don't boast about it,
Succeed but don't brag about it,
Succeed but don't be arrogant,
Succeed and take it as you have to,
Succeed and don't attempt to dominate.
Things must grow old after reaching their prime, which is contrary to Tao.
Whatever is contrary to Tao will soon perish.
