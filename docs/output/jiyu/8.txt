The highest good is like water.
Water is apt to benefit all things and does not compete with them.
It dwells in places people disdain.
Thus it is closest to Tao.
(The best man should be like water)
In his dwelling he is at ease with lowness,
In his heart he is profound,
He is sincere in his dealings with others,
He is faithful in speech,
He is orderly in government,
He is competent in deeds,
He is timely in action.
It is because he is not competitive that he is without any faults.
