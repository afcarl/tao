He who knows does not speak,
And he who speaks does not know.
Blocking the vent (of knowledge), closing the door (of knowledge), covering the cutting-edge, going beyond entanglement, containing the light, and mixing with the dust,
- These can be called "the mysterious agreement."
So, (the person with "the mysterious agreement")
Cannot be treated intimately,
Cannot be estranged,
Cannot be given profits,
Cannot be injured,
Cannot be raised to nobility,
And cannot be made humble,
And can therefore be esteemed by all the people under Heaven.
