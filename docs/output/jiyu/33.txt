He who knows others is wise,
He who knows himself is enlightened.
He who conquers others can be called physically strong,
He who conquers himself is mighty.
He who is content is rich,
He who acts with persistence has will,
He who does not lose his root will endure,
He who dies physically, but preserves Tao will enjoy a long life.
