He who desires to govern under Heaven and build up achievements will not succeed, which I assert.
"The under Heaven" which is a queer thing, cannot be handled arbitrarily.
He who acts arbitrarily will harm it,
He who holds on to it will lose it.
Therefore of all creatures (in themselves) some lead and some follow, some breathe and some blow, some are strong and some weak, some are baffled and some destroyed.
For this reason, the sage should discard the extremes, the extravagant and the excessive.
