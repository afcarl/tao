Saying few words fits in with Nature.
Therefore a whirlwind does not last a whole morning,
Nor does a rainstorm last a whole day.
Whoever makes them like this?
It is Heaven and Earth.
If (the fierce force of) Heaven and Earth cannot last long,
How much less man?
Therefore he who follows Tao (should know:)
The seeker of Tao is identified with Tao.
The seeker of De is identified with De,
He who seeks the loss (of Tao) is identified with loss.
He who is identified with Tao -
Tao is also happy to have him.
He who is identified with De -
De is also happy to have him.
He who is identified with the loss -
The loss is also happy to have him.
Only when one has no faith will faithless events take place.
