He who is brave in daring everything will be killed,
And he who is brave in daring nothing will live on.
Of the results of the two kinds of braveness, one is advantageous, the other is harmful.
When Heaven has some detestation,
Who can know its cause?
So even the sage feels it difficult to explain.
It is the Tao (Way) of Heaven:
Not to struggle and yet be good at winning,
Not to speak and yet be good at replying,
Without being called it comes of itself,
though slow, it plans skillfully.
The net of Heaven is vast,
It has large meshes, but it lets nothing escape.
