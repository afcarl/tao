Man ahs a soft and weak body when he is alive,
Whereas his body becomes hard and rigid after his death.
All things, grasses and trees have tender twigs and branches when they are alive,
Whereas they become dry and withered when they are dead.
Therefore the hard and strong belong to death,
Whereas the soft and weak belong to life.
Thus the armed forces will be shattered when they become strong,
And trees will be broken when they grow strong.
The hard and strong are in the inferior position,
And the soft and weak are in the superior position.
