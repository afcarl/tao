To yield is yet to be preserved wholly,
To be bent is yet to become straight,
To be hollow is yet to be filled up,
To be worn out is yet to be renewed,
To have little (knowledge) is yet to gain,
To have much (knowledge) is yet to be perplexed.
There the sage takes Tao (the One) as the instrument to observe destiny under Heaven.
He does not merely rely on his own eyes,
Therefore he is wise and penetrating;
He does not consider himself always in the right,
Therefore he is able to tell right from wrong;
He does not boast of himself,
Therefore he is given credit;
He does not think himself superior,
Therefore he is qualified for leadership.
It is precisely because he does not compete that nobody under Heaven could compete with him.
How could such old sayings be false as "to yield is yet to be preserved wholly"?
Truly they will preserve people well.
