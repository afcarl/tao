When one is born, he will eventually naturally meet his death.
Three out of every ten people will enjoy long life,
While three out of every ten people will meet premature death.
Chances that one strives to live and will die are also three out of ten.
And for what reason?
Because that one intensively craves life (and contrarily he fails to attain his objective).
I heard that one who is good at preserving his life is not afraid of meeting tigers or rhinoceroses when traveling on the land, and he will not be injured of killed in fighting battles.
(To those who are good at preserving their lives)
The rhinoceros cannot butt its horns against him,
The tiger cannot fasten its claws in him,
And weapons cannot thrust their blades into him.
For what reason are all these?
Because he is out of the range of death.
