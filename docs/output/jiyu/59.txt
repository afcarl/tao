For the rule of the people and the service of Heaven, there is nothing better than the principle of "parsimony."
Only by "parsimony" can one be unhurried and get ready early.
Being unhurried and getting ready early is what I call the repeated accumulation of the "De" of "parsimony."
With the repeated accumulation of De, one can victoriously overcome any obstacles.
The power which can overcome any obstacles is immeasurable.
With immeasurable power one can govern a state.
Having the foundation of government, one can maintain sovereignty very long.
This is called the Way in which one can plant the roots deep and make the stalks firm and maintain a long life.
