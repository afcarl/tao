He who is god at being a shi (officer) does not boast of his martialism;
He who is good at fighting does not resort to his rage;
He who is skillful in winning against the enemy does not wrestle with them;
He who is skillful in managing his men has a modest attitude toward them.
This is called the De of not contending with others;
This is called the power of making use of others' force;
This is called being in accord with the Way of Heaven,
Thus it has been a principle very long since.
