The stability of things is easy to hold while they are stable;
Things are easy to deal with while they show no sign of change;
Things are easily broken while they are still fragile;
Things are easily dispersed while they are minute.
Deal with things before they have happened,
And get things in order before their disorder begins.
A huge tree which fills one's arms grows from a tiny seedling;
A high terrace which has nine storeys rises from a small heap of earth;
A journey of a thousand li begins with the first step.
He who takes action messes things up;
And he who holds things fast loses them.
Therefore, the sage does not fail in anything since he does nothing;
Does not lose anything since he holds nothing.
People often fail when they are about to succeed in their business.
If they are as careful at the end as at the beginning,
They would not ruin their business.
Therefore the sage's desire is to have no desire,
And he doesn't value rare goods.
(The Sage's) learning is to learn nothing, in order to remedy the fault that people often have.
Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act constrainedly.
