Nothing under Heaven is softer and weaker than water,
But in attacking the hard and strong, no force can compare with it,
For nothing can take its place.
The reason why the weak can overcome the strong and the soft can overcome the heard is known to all the people under Heaven,
But none would follow and practice it.
Therefore the sage said:
He who bears humiliation of the whole state can be the sovereign of the country.
He who bears the disaster of the whole state can be the king of all under Heaven.
Positive words seem to be negative.
