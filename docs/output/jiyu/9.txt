To hold and to fill is not as good as to give up.
If a sword edge is sharpened to its sharpest,
It is hard to last long.
If your hall is filled with gold and jade,
Whoever could keep them safe?
To be proud with honour and wealth will bring misfortune.
To withdraw as soon as the work is done
That is Heaven's right way (Tao).
