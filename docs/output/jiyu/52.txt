All the things in the world have their origin in something, which is their foundation (mother).
Having grasped the Mother as the foundation of all things, one can know her children as all things.
Having grasped the children as the thing, one must hold to the Mother as the foundation of all things.
Thus one will never encounter danger all his life.
Blocking the vent (of knowledge) and closing the door (of knowledge) can keep one from sickness all his life.
Opening the vent (of knowledge) and completing the enterprise (of knowledge) will make one helpless all his life.
So, perceiving the minute is "sagaciousness,"
Remaining soft and weak is "powerfulness."
Using one's contained light and reverting to one's sagaciousness of knowing the minute,
And thus keeping oneself from disaster, is to become accustomed to the eternal Way.
