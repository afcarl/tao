The shi (Knower of Tao) in the old times is subtle, profound and generous, too deep to be understood by the common people.
As he is thus beyond people's knowledge,
I can only describe him arbitrarily.
(He is) cautious beforehand, like wading into a river in winter.
(He is) considering repeatedly, like one vigilant when threatened by neighbouring states' attack.
(He is) grave and reverent, like a visiting guest.
(He is) supple and pliant, like ice which is about to melt.
(He is) genuine and plain, like an uncarved block.
(He is) open and broad, like a quiet valley.
(He is) all-embracing, like a great muddy river.
Who can make the muddy water clear?
As it quiets down it will become clear.
Who can make stillness last?
It will gradually lose the peace as change arises.
He who preserves this Tao does not wish for overflowing.
It is precisely because there is no overflowing that he is able to succeed continually,
Though he looks conservative.
