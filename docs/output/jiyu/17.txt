The best rulers are those about whom people know nothing but their existence.
The next best are those whom people love and praise,
The next best are those whom people fear,
The next are those whom people despise.
Only when one is not faithworthy, will faithless events take place!
So idle, (the best rulers) seldom issue any orders.
When some affairs are accomplished,
All common people will say "We are in ourselves."
