When the Great Tao is abandoned,
The doctrines of benevolence and righteousness will come to light.
When knowledge and wisdom appear,
Great hypocrisy will also emerge.
When a family falls into dispute,
Filial piety and parental affection to children will be advocated.
When a country falls into disorder,
There will be loyal ministers.
