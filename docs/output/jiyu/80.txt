Let the state be small, and let the population be sparse.
Though there are various kinds of instruments, let them not be used;
Let the people not risk their lives, not move to distant places;
Though there be boats and carriages,
There is no occasion to ride in them;
Though there are weapons and military equipment,
There is no occasion to display them.
Let the people return to the use of knotted cord sin recording events, delight in their food, dress in beauty, dwell in comfort, and enjoy their life.
The neighbouring states are within sight of each other, and the cries of roosters and dogs can be heard by one another,
But the people do not have any contact with each other until they die of old age.
