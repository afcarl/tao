The True Person does not have an individual heart
but uses the heart of the people.

I am kind to those who are kind.
I am also kind to those who are not kind.
Thus, there is an increase in kindness.
I keep faith with those who are in good faith.
I also keep faith with those WhO lack good faith.
Thus, there is an increase of good faith.

The True Person is detached and humble
and to the world appears confusing.
The people all strain their eyes and ears, yet the True Person remains childlike.
