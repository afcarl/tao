In the pursuit of learning,
every day something isadded.
In the pursuit of the Tao,
every day something is dropped.

Less and less is done
until you come to action with striving.
When you follow this practice,
nothing remains undone.

All under heaven is won by
letting things take their cuurse.
Nothing can be gained by interfering.
