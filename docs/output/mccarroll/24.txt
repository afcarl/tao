The person on tiptoe is not steady.
The person with legs astride cannot walk.

Those who look only at thernselves see little.
Those who justify themselves are not distinguished.
Those who brag have no merit.
The work of prideful people will not endure.

From the standpoint of the Tao,
these things are
"excessive food and tumors of the body."
As they bring sickness, followers of the Tao do not linger around them.
