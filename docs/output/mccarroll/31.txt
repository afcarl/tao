Weapons are ill-omened things.

Among gentle people the left side
is the place of honor when at home,
but in war the right side is the place of honor.

Weapons are not proper instruments for gentle people;
they use them only when they have no other choice.
Peace and quiet are what they value.
They do not glory in victory.
to glorify it is to delight in the slaughter of people.
Those who delight in the slaughter of people will
never thrive among all that dwell under heaven.

The army that has killed people
should be received with sorrow.
Conquerors should be received with the rites of mourning.
