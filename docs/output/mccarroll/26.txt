Whe solid must be the root of the light.
The still must be the master of thc restless.

Therefore, wise people when traveling all day
do not lose sight of their baggage cart.
Although there are beautiful scenes to see,
they remain quietly in their own place.
Should a lord of ten thousand chariots
appear more frivolous than a simple traveler?

To be light is to lose the root.
To be restless is to lose the master.
