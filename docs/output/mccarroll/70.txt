My words are easy to understand
and easy to put into practice.
Yet no one under heaven understands them
or puts them into practice.

My words have an ancestor. My actions are governed.

Because people do not understand this
they do not understand me.
Those who understand me are few.
Those who follow me should be respected.

Therefore, the True Person wears homespun clothes
and carries jade in the heart.
