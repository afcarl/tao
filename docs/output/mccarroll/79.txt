Even though a truce is made between great enemies,
some enmity is bound to remain.
How can this be beneficial?

Therefore, the True Person
undertakes the obligations of the agreerment
but makes no claim upon others.
The person who has Virtue shares with others.
The person who lacks Virtue takes fron others.

The way of heaven has no favorites;
it always remains with what is good.
