The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow;
the high end is bent down, and the low end is raised up.
Where there is excess, it is decreased;
and where there is lack, it is filled.
The Way of Heaven is to reduce excess and fill what is lacking.

The way of Humankind is not like this;
it takes from those who have too little
and gives it to those who have too much.
Who can take their surplus and offer it to the world?
Only those who have the Tao.

This is why wise people are not attached to their actions,
do good deeds without dwelling on them,
and have no wish to boast of their talents.
