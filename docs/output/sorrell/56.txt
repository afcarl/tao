Those who know, don’t speak about it.
Those who speak about it, don’t know.
Cease the idle chatter. Close the doors.
Blunt what is sharp. Untie the knots.
Blend with the light. Be at one with the dusty world.
This is called Profound Unity.

We cannot attain this and think of it as something personal to us.
Nor can we attain this and think of it as something apart from us.
We cannot attain this and think we have gained anything.
Nor can we attain this and think we have lost anything.
We cannot attain this and think of it as valuable.
Nor can we attain this and think of it as worthless.

This is why the Tao is honored throughout the world.
