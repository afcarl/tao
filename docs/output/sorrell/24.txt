Those who stand on tiptoe are not steady.
Those who stand with legs astride cannot walk.
Those who hold a high opinion of themselves are not enlightened.
Those who admire themselves are not beautiful.
Those who think much of themselves are worthless.
Those who are conceited will not endure.

Those with the Tao call this self-indulgent and parasitical behavior.
These are loathsome things.
So those in the Tao will have nothing to do with them.
