In all the world there is nothing as soft and yielding as water.
But for overcoming the hard and rigid, nothing can beat it,
because it cannot be changed into something else.

Supple overcomes the unbending,
flexible overcomes the unyielding.
In the whole world there is no one who does not know this,
yet there is no one who can apply it.

This is why wise people say:
Those who take responsibility for their country’s disgraces
are called Lords of Earth and Grain.
Those who take responsibility for a country’s misfortunes
are kings of the world.
Straight talk sounds contradictory.
