The Way flows freely,
yet however much it is used it can never be used up.

Vast! It seems to be the ancestor of all things.
It smoothes out sharp edges and straightens out tangles;
softens the glare and settles the dust.

Deep! It appears to have existed forever.
I do not know whose child it is.
It seems to precede even the ancestor of God.
