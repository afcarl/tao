Everyone in the world is aware of beauty;
and so there exists ugliness.
Everyone is aware of skill;
and so there exists awkwardness.

Existence and Emptiness give rise to each other.
Hardship and ease succeed each other.
Lasting and brief define each other.
High and low are the measure of each other.
Sound and tone harmonize each other.
Before and after follow each other.
And so there is balance.

This is how wise people effortlessly attend to their affairs.
Teaching without words, everything gets done in its own time.

Spontaneously arising. Acting without expectation.
Deeds are done and not dwelt upon.
Since they are not dwelt upon, nothing is lost.
