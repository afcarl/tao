Those who possess the mysterious inner power
are like the red bottomed baby
whom poisonous insects do not sting,
whom savage beasts do not seize,
whom birds of prey do not attack.
Their bones are weak, and their muscles soft,
but their grasp is firm.

Sex has not been experienced, yet they get sexually excited,
and are full of vital energy.
They can cry all day without getting hoarse,
because the vital energy is in perfect balance.
Having perfect balance is equanimity.
To have equanimity is to know the light.

To thrive in life is fortunate.
Those who use their mind to direct their energy are strong.
What flourishes must fade, and this is not the Tao,
for all things not with the Tao will meet with an early end.
