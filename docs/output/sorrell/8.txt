The highest good is like water.
Water is capable of benefiting all things, because it does not struggle.
It is found in places avoided by most people,
and so it is close to the Tao.

The essence of conduct is its integrity.
The essence of the psyche is its sincerity.
The essence of giving is its benevolence.
The essence of speech is its truthfulness.
The essence of authority is in bringing order.
The essence of getting things done is in being competent.
The essence of taking action is in the timing.
Since there is no struggle there are no mistakes.
