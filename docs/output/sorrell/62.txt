The Tao is the shelter and the refuge of all things.
It is the treasure of the good and the protector of the bad.

People get respect by being polite,
and correct behavior increases their status.
Why expect those we may not approve of to abandon such practices?

When the Son of Heaven is crowned
and the three chief ministers are appointed,
even though we present them with handfuls of jade amulets
and seals carried before a team of four horses,
it is not as good as kneeling down
and making this Tao our presentation.

Why did the ancient ones so value this Tao?
Did they not say:
The seeker finds, and the guilty are forgiven?
Therefore it is the most valued thing in the world.
