In the act of learning there are daily increases.
In enacting the Tao there are daily decreases.
Decrease, and decrease again until we reach
the not-doing of effortless spontaneous action.
In not-doing, nothing is left undone.

In dealing with worldly affairs, resist getting caught up in them.
If we do get entangled, we will not be as effective.
