Act without putting on an act.
Do things without getting entangled in them.
Taste that which has no flavor.

Whether big or small, many or few,
respond to hatred with understanding.

Take on the difficult by doing what is easy.
Take on the big by doing what is small.
In the world, difficult tasks should be done in easy stages.
In the world, big affairs should be broken down into their details.

That is why to the very end, wise people make no big deal of things; and that is how big things get done.
Promises lightly made are hardly trusted.
The easier it looks the more difficult it probably is.
This is why wise people treat everything as difficult,
and so in the end, nothing is difficult for them.
