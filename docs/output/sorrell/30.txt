Those who use the Tao to assist their ruler do not use military force;
for such actions are likely to provoke retribution.

Where the army has been, thorns and thistles will grow.
After a great battle there will follow years of famine.

The skillful are successful, yet do not presume to take things by force.
Successful, yet not boasting. Successful, yet not punishing.
Successful, yet not arrogant. Successful, yet not taking advantage.
Successful, yet not dominating.

Even what is strong, in time, becomes old.
It is said that this is not the Tao,
and all things not with the Tao, will meet an early end.
