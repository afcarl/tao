In nourishing spirit and vitality and embracing unity,
can we prevent them from breaking up?
In focussing our breath and making it soft,
can we be like a baby?
In cleansing our mind and contemplating the mystery,
can we be flawless?
In loving our people and ruling our country,
can we not interfere?
When the Gate of Heaven opens and closes,
can we be receptive?
In understanding the four realms,
can we not use knowledge?

Bring forth and nourish.
Bring forth without possessing.
Encourage without creating dependency.
Strengthen without controlling.
This is called Profound Virtue.
