Tao gives us life. The life force nourishes us.
Matter gives us our form. Environment completes us.

This is why there is nothing that does not
venerate the Tao and honor the life force.
Venerating the Tao and honoring the life force isn’t demanded:
it arises naturally and spontaneously in everything.

So the Tao gives us life, and the life force nourishes us.
By them we are encouraged, nurtured, shaped,
ripened, provided for, and protected.

To give life without being possessive, to act without exploiting,
and to encourage without dominating, is called:
“having a profound spirit.”
