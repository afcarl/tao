Bend and be whole.
Twist and be straight.
Empty out and be filled.
Be used up and be renewed.
Have little and be satisfied.
Have much and be confused.

This is why a wise person embraces the One,
and becomes an example for the whole world.

If we do not show off, we will shine.
If we are not assertive, we will be recognized.
If we do not praise ourselves, we will gain merit.
If we are not reckless, we will endure.
If we do not compete, no one can compete with us.

The old saying goes: Bend and be whole.
Are these empty words?
These are perfect words, and we can rely on them.
