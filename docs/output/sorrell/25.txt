There is a substance, utterly formless.
It existed before Heaven and Earth were born.
So silent! So vast!
It is solitary and unchanging, all pervasive and without end.
It could be considered the Mother of Heaven and Earth.
I do not know its name, but if I must find a word for it,
I will call it the Tao.
And if I must describe it, I will call it vast.
Being vast, it permeates everywhere.
Permeating everywhere, it is far reaching.
Reaching far, it returns.

The Tao is great.
Heaven is great.
Earth is great.
Humankind is great.
These are the four great things in the Universe,
and Humankind is one of them.
Humankind follows the law of Earth.
Earth follows the law of Heaven.
Heaven follows the law of the Tao.
The Tao follows its own law.
