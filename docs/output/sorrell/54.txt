What is well established will not be uprooted.
What is well embraced will not be renounced.
Then generation after generation will offer thanks without cease.

Cultivate this in self and our spirit will be real.
Cultivate this in family and its spirit will be overflowing.
Cultivate this in our village and its spirit will endure.
Cultivate this in our nations and their spirits will be plentiful.
Cultivate this in our world and its spirit will be universal.

Therefore:
It takes a person to understand a person.
It takes a family to understand a family.
It takes a village to understand a village.
It takes a nation to understand a nation.
It takes a world to understand a world.
How do I know the nature of all things under Heaven?
It is because I use this method.
