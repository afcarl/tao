Without going out our door we can know the whole world.
Without peering out our window we can see the Tao of Heaven.
The further we go the less we know.

This is why wise ones:
Do not have to go anywhere to know everything.
Do not have to see something to understand it.
Do not have to do anything to achieve everything.
