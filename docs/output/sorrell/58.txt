When government is restrained, people are pure and simple.
When government is meddlesome, people are found wanting.

Disaster arises from good fortune.
Good fortune hides within disaster.
Who can say how things will turn out in the end?
Life is just not fair.

Normal becomes abnormal. Good becomes evil.
People are as confused as the day is long.
This is why wise people
are straight with us, but do not put us down.
Are honest but not hurtful.
Are direct but not reckless.
Are bright but not flashy.
