Use justice to rule the country.
Use surprise to deploy the army.
Use non-interference to deal with the world.

How do I know the nature of things?
I use these truths:
When there are many taboos and restrictions in the world,
people are poorer for it.
When people have many weapons,
the country will fall into chaos.
When people use tricks and deceit,
strange things happen.
When laws and regulations become the most important thing,
there will be more thieves and bandits around.

So wise people say:
I do nothing and people transform by themselves.
I am tranquil and people do right by themselves.
I do not meddle and people enrich themselves.
I want for nothing and people simplify their lives.
