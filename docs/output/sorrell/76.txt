While people are alive their bodies are supple and soft.
When they die they become hard and rigid.

While grasses and trees are alive they are supple and pliant.
When they die they become withered and dried out.

Therefore the hard and rigid are the signs of death,
while the supple and soft are the signs of life.
If the army is inflexible it will be wiped out.
If the tree is brittle it will snap.

The hard and rigid are of lesser value.
The supple and soft are superior.
