Just as the meaningful is the origin of the trivial,
so calmness is the master of agitation.
That is why the gentleman, all through the dayâ€™s journey,
does not leave his baggage unattended.

Though there may be exquisite scenery,
and places where swallows fly, he passes them by.
Only when he is safely in his inn and relaxing, is he free of concern.

How can we be master of a thousand chariots,
and treat ourselves with disrespect?
Those who act lightly lose their base.
Those who are impetuous, lose control.
