Good walkers leave no trace.
Good speakers place no blame.
Those good with numbers need no calculator.
Those able to secure things have no need for lock or key,
yet no one can open it.
Those good at tying, need no rope for binding,
yet no one can undo it.

This is why wise people are always able to help others,
and no one is abandoned.
They are good at looking after things,
and nothing is wasted.
This is called twofold understanding.

Therefore, the skillful person
is the teacher of those who are less competent;
and those who are less competent
are the raw material of the skillful person.
Not to treasure one’s teacher, and not to treasure one’s resources, even if we are clever, will lead us far astray.
This is called the subtle essence of the mystery.
