Fame or life; which is closer to our heart?
Life or possessions; which is more important?
Gain or loss; which is more harmful?

Excessive passions are very costly.
Those who hoard greatly will lose much.

By knowing when we have had enough, we avoid disgrace.
Those who know when to stop will come to no harm,
and will long continue.
