The reason why rivers and oceans are kings of the one hundred valleys
is because they are good at taking the low ground.
Thus they can be the kings of a hundred valleys.

This is why:
If wise people want to be above others,
they must speak from a position below them.
If they want to be in front of others,
they must place themselves behind them.

This is why :
When wise people are in a high position, people are not burdened,
and when they lead them, people come to no harm.

This is why :
The whole world happily supports them and will never despise them.
Since they do not oppose anyone no one can oppose them.
