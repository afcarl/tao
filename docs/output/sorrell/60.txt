Ruling a large country is like cooking small fish.

When we use the Tao to deal with the world,
demons have no spiritual power.
It is not that demons have no spiritual power,
but that they have no effect on people.

Their spiritual power will do no harm,
just as the wise one does no harm.
When both of them are not causing harm,
their powers are restored in a harmonious union.
