Holding our cup up to be refilled
is not as good as stopping.
If we are always sharpening our knives,
they wonâ€™t hold their edge for long.
If gold and jade fill our rooms,
it will be impossible for us to protect them.
To be arrogant about our wealth and status,
is to bring down disaster on ourselves.
When the good deed is done, withdraw.
This is the Way of Heaven.
