Long ago there were Ancient Ones
who were masters at practicing the Tao,
and who understood its subtle mysteries.

They were so profound we cannot really know them.
Since we cannot know them,
we can only describe them by their actions.

Prepared! like someone about to ford a river in winter.
Diplomatic! like someone respectful of their neighbors.
Courteous! like one who is a guest.
Expansive! like ice melting.
Natural! like uncarved wood.
Receptive! like a valley.
Blending! like swirling water.
What is muddy, when left still, will gradually become clear.
What is at rest, when moved, will gradually come to life.
Those who keep this Tao have no need for fulfillment.
Since they have no need for fulfillment,
they can remain unknown, and so be pure and complete.
