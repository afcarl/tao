The Great Way is boundless! It flows in every direction.
All things depend upon it for life, and it does not fail them.
It works in our favor, yet claims no credit.

The Tao clothes and cares for all things, without being their master.
We can say it is small,
yet it is a refuge for all things,without controlling any thing.
We can say it is great,
but the Tao does not make a big thing of itself,
and so is able to achieve great things.
