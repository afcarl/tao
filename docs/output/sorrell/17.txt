The best leader; people do not know he exists.
The next best; people are close to him and praise him.
The next best; people fear him.
The next best; people scorn him.

The untrustworthy have no trust.
We take our time and value our words.
We do good deeds and get things done.
Then people will say, “I did it all by myself.”
