My words are very easy to understand,
and very easy to apply.
Yet no one in the world can understand them,
and no one can apply them.

My words are from an ancient source,
my deeds are from a noble authority.
It is because people don’t understand this,
that they don’t understand me.

Those who understand me are rare,
those who follow me, are precious.
This is why, while wise people may wear coarse woolen cloth,
they carry precious jade in their hearts.
