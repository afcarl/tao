There is a small country with few people,
and though they have hundreds of tools and utensils,
they do not use them.

Because they play it safe, people do not travel far away.
Although they have boats and chariots, no one rides them.
Although they have armor and weapons, no one parades them.
People return to knotting ropes to keep account of things.

Their government is excellent,
their food is sweet,
their clothing is beautiful,
their homes are peaceful,
and their festivals are joyful.

Neighboring countries may overlook one another
and hear the sounds of each othersâ€™ chickens and dogs;
and yet they will reach old age and death
without ever having visited one other.
