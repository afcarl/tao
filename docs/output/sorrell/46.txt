When Tao rules in the world, work-horses manure the fields.
When Tao does not rule in the world,
war-horses are bred outside the city.

There is no greater disaster than not
knowing when we have had enough.
There is no greater fault than the desire for gain.
Therefore those who know when enough is enough,
always have enough.
