Observe the world as a vast unfolding appearance.
Events transpire harmlessly in great peace and serenity.

Music and enticing food may make those passing by stop.
But when the word “Tao” leaves our mouth,
it has no taste, and is without flavor.
Looked for, it cannot be found.
Listened for, it cannot be heard.
Yet when used, it is inexhaustible.
