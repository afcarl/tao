A large country, like a river estuary,
is the gathering place of the world:
It is the womb of the world.
The female principle uses gentleness
to overcome the male aggression.
Gentleness is low key.

So when a large country defers to a small country,
it gains influence in the small country.
And when a small country defers to a large country,
it gains influence in the large country.
So either accept a subordinate position and gain influence
or assume a subordinate position and gain influence.

A large country cannot ignore its wish to nurture
and nourish many people at the same time;
just as a small country cannot ignore its wish
to join in with other people.
Thus they both get what they want;
and so it is fitting for the larger country to act with humility.
