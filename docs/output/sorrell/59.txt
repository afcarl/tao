When governing people and serving Heaven
there is nothing like restraint.
Being restrained means being prepared.
Being prepared means the continuous
accumulation of personal power.

When we are constantly accumulating personal power
there is nothing we cannot do.
When there is nothing we cannot do,
then we will know no limits.
If we have no limitations, we can rule a country.
If we rule our country like a mother, we will last a long time.
It is said: Planting deep roots, makes for a strong trunk.
This is the Way of Long Life of Lasting Awareness.
