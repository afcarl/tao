The world has a source which is the mother of the world.
When we know the mother, we will understand her children.
In understanding her children we will regain the protection of the mother, and until our death we will suffer no harm.

If we cease our idle chatter and close the door,
then we will have an easy life.
If we’re engaged in endless chatter, and crave many things,
then we will have a difficult life.

Noticing the subtle signs is to have understanding.
Keeping our sensitivity is to have strength.
By developing our clarity, we find wisdom.
If we don’t bring trouble into our lives,
we are able to practice equanimity.
