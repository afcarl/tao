If people did not fear death;
Then what would be the use of threatening them with death?

In fact people do fear death; and they do act strangely,
But I would not, because of this,
presume to seize, imprison, and execute them.

Yet there is always someone willing
to be the executioner and do the killing.
But to take the place of the Executioner and kill is called:
“taking the place of the Master Carpenter at woodworking.”

And of those who presume to take the place of the Master Carpenter,
there are very few who do not hurt their hands.
