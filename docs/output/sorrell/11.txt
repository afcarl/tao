Thirty spokes share one hub.
With the space they make, we can use the cart.

Clay is shaped to make a vessel.
With the empty space we can use the vessel.

Cut out doors and windows to make a room.
With the empty space we can use the room.

Having things is advantageous,
but it is the space within them that creates their use.
