Heaven is eternal and Earth endures.
Heaven and Earth endure, because they exist for others.
Therefore, the universe persists.

That is why wise people put themselves last,
yet find themselves first.
They are detached from self-concern,
and yet are safe from harm.
Is this because they are unselfish,
and so can fulfill themselves?
