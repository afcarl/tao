When life leaves, death enters in.

The avenues of life are thirteen,
and the avenues of death are thirteen.
And for those who are alive and moving towards the place of death, there are also thirteen avenues.

Why is this so?
It is because they use up their energies on the luxuries of life.

One hears of those who are good at staying alive.
When living in the hills they encounter no rhinoceros or tigers.
When going into battle they wear no armor nor carry any weapons.
The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn.
The tiger has nowhere to strike with its claws.
Weapons have nowhere to insert their blades.
Why is this so?
It is because they have no place in them for death.
