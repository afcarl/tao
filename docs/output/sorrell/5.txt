Heaven and Earth are not biased;
they treat everything like straw dogs.
Wise people are not biased;
they treat all people like straw dogs.

Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows?
It is hollow, yet never collapses.
The more we pump it, the more it produces.

Too much talk leaves us exhausted.
Itâ€™s not as good as staying within.
