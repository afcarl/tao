The Tao never does anything, yet there is nothing it leaves undone.
If our leaders could hold to this, everything would be transformed.

If transformation occurs and desires still arise,
I will cool them down with the nameless original simplicity.
If I cool them with the nameless original simplicity,
they will be free of desires.

If they are free of desires there will be tranquillity,
and all will be right with the world.
