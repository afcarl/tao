True words are not beautiful.
Beautiful words are not true.
Good people do not argue; those who argue are not good.
Those who know are not learned;
those who are learned do not know.

Wise people do not hoard.
Because they work for others, they have more for themselves.
Because they give to others, they get more for themselves.

The Way of Heaven is to help, and not to harm.
The wise person acts in this way, and does not cause contention.
