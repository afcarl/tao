When the best scholars hear of the Tao,
they practice it with diligence.
When the middling scholars hear of the Tao,
they seem to get it, and then seem to lose it.
When the worst scholars hear of the Tao,
they make fun of it.
If they didn’t laugh at it, it wouldn’t be the Tao.

The sayings go:
The light of the Tao appears dark.
Progress in the Tao looks like retreat.
The smooth Tao appears tangled.
The highest truth seems incomplete.
The greatest purity seems defiled.
Vast goodness appears to be inadequate.
Proven integrity looks furtive.
The simplest truth seems fickle.
An infinite square has no corners.
Those with the greatest ability mature slowly.
The perfect note is rarely heard.
The great world of appearance has no shape.
The Tao is hidden and has no name,
and yet by it we are forgiven and fulfilled.
