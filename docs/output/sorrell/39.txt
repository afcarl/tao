Long ago these things became whole:
Heaven became whole, and was clear.
Earth became whole, and was peaceful.
The gods became whole, and had vitality.
The valley became whole, and was plentiful.
All things became whole, and came to life.
Princes and Kings became whole,
and acted righteously towards the world.

Because of this it is said:
If Heaven were not clear,
there would be fear of it splitting asunder.
If Earth were not peaceful,
there would be fear of it being laid to waste.
If the gods had no vitality,
there would be fear of them giving up.
If the valley were not plentiful,
there would be fear of it being exhausted.
If all things did not take birth,
there would be fear of them becoming extinct.
If Princes and Kings did not act righteously,
there would be fear of them stumbling and falling.
What is noble is rooted in what is humble.
What is high is founded upon that which is low.
This is why Princes and Kings identify themselves with
the orphan, the lonely, and the destitute.
This is taking the humble as our root, is it not?

So it is, when we seek praise, we do not receive real praise.
And it is for this reason,
that we do not desire the rarest jade, or necklaces of garnet.
