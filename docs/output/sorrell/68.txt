The best warrior is not war-like.
The best fighter is not angry.
The best at defeating the enemy do not engage them.
The best at handling people are low key.

This is called the virtue of non-aggression.
This is called being able to get people to give their best.
This is called uniting with the most ancient
and highest principle of Heaven.
