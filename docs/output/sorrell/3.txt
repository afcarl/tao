Not rewarding talent keeps us from rivalry.
Not valuing rare goods keeps us from thievery.
Not seeing desirable things keeps us from anxiety.

That is why the wise rule others
by opening their hearts and filling their bellies,
tempering their ambition and strengthening their bones.

In this state, the mind is at peace, and desire is at an end.
For this reason issues are not forced.
Actions are done effortlessly, and yet nothing is left undone.
