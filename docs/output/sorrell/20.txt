Is there really that much difference
between “probably” and “maybe?”
And isn’t the difference between “good” and “bad” similar?
Making these distinctions can fill a person with fear;
fear that cannot be avoided.
The confusion! It is endless!

Most people are so happy-go-lucky,
as when celebrating the ox sacrifice;
or in Spring, when they climb the towers.
I alone am becalmed! Leaving no trace.
A dummy! Like a baby that has not yet learned to laugh.
Lost and forlorn! With no home to return to.
Everyone else has plenty. I alone seem to have been left out.
What kind of fool am I to have such a heart!

Ordinary people are so smart and clever.
I alone am dull and confused.
Ordinary people are so inquisitive.
I alone am sad and listless.
Indistinct, like the ocean.
Gazing without end.

Everyone else has what it takes.
I alone am a blockhead and an outcast.
My desires alone differ from those of others,
for I treasure the Mother as the source of my nourishment.
