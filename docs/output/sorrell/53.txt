If I know anything at all it is that I will walk the Way of the Tao;
and straying from it will be my only fear.
The Great Way is completely safe, but most people prefer side paths.

The royal court is extremely wasteful,
yet the fields are completely overgrown.
The storehouse is quite empty,
yet their clothing is rich and bright.
They carry sharp swords
and gorge themselves on food and drink.
They have more money and possessions
than they know what to do with.

These people are called swaggering bandits.
This is not the Tao!
