Those who know others are clever,
but those who know themselves are wise.

Those who conquer others have great strength,
but those who conquer themselves have the greater power.

Knowing when we have enough is prosperity.
With self discipline, we develop strength of character.

In not forgetting who we are, we live forever.
To die, yet not to perish, is to be immortal.
