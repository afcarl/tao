The Tao shall be forever nameless.
Even though it may appear to be trivial,
it is the pristine state.
The world cannot control it.
If princes and kings hold to this, the whole world would cooperate.
Then Heaven and Earth would unite to pour forth sweet dew.
People, without being commanded, would act fairly to one other.

In order to exercise control over something, we name it,
but all we have is a name.
Knowing when to stop doing this, we avoid trouble.
For the Tao goes through the world like a valley stream
leading us to the rivers and ocean.
