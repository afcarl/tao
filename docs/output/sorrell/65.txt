In olden times those who practiced the Tao
did not enlighten the people, but left them simple.
People are difficult to govern when they are too clever.

Those who use cleverness and cunning to govern a country
are the thieves of the country.
Those who do not use cleverness to govern a country
are the blessed of the country.

Knowing these two things shows us the method people use.
To always know what method is being used
is called Profound Understanding.
Profound Understanding is deep and far reaching;
it helps all things return to the Tao
and realize The Great Acceptance.
