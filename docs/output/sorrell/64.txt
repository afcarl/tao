What is at rest is easy to grasp.
What has not yet happened is easy to plan for.
What is fragile is easily broken.
What is minute is easily scattered.

Act before it happens.
Exert control before it gets out of hand.
A tree that takes both arms to embrace starts off as a tiny shoot.
A nine story terrace starts with a basket of earth.
A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.

Those who force things to happen are defeated by them.
Those who cling to things lose them.
This is why wise people do not force issues and are not defeated.
They do not cling and they do not lose.
When people are engaged in enterprises;
it is always when they have nearly succeeded that they fail.
If we are as careful at the end as we were at the beginning,
then we will not fail in our ventures.
This is why wise people want not to want,
and do not value rare and expensive goods.
They learn what is not studied
and return to what others have ignored.
They assist all things in realizing their true nature,
yet they do not presume to interfere with them.
