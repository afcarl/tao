The wise ones are not concerned with themselves,
and so are able to embrace othersâ€™ concerns.

To those who are good, I am good.
To those who are not good, I am also good.
Our essential nature is good.
To those who are honest, I am honest.
To those who are not honest, I am also honest.
Our essential nature is honest.

When wise people appear in the world they are at peace.
When they act in the world they are wholehearted.
All people focus their eyes and ears on them.
For to the wise they are all their children.
