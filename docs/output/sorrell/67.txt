Everyone in the world says my Tao is the greatest
and that it is unique.
It resembles nothing else.
It is great, because there is nothing like it.
If there were anything like it,
it would have become insignificant long ago.

I have three treasures that I always keep and protect:
The first I call compassion.
The second I call moderation.
The third I call humility.
With compassion we can be brave.
With moderation we can be generous.
With humility we can develop our talents.

Now if we abandon compassion and think we can be brave,
If we abandon moderation and think we can be generous,
If we abandon following and think we can be first,
then we will surely die.
If with compassion we engage in battle, we will win,
and our defenses will be secure.
When Heaven comes to our rescue,
it is with a protective circle of compassion.
