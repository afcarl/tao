Nature speaks rarely.
A raging wind does not outlast the morning,
and a sudden shower does not outlast the day.

What causes this? It is Heaven and Earth.
Since even Heaven and Earth cannot last forever,
how could a person expect to?

Therefore, those who actions are in harmony with the Tao,
are one with the Tao.
Likewise the powerful are one with power,
and the losers are one with loss.

Those who identify with the Tao, the Tao so empowers.
Those who identify with power, the Tao so empowers.
Those who identify with loss, the Tao so empowers.
The untrustworthy have no trust.
