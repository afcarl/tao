The Tao gives birth to the One.
The One gives birth to the Two.
The Two gives birth to the Three.
The Three gives birth to the Ten Thousand Things.
The Ten Thousand Things are supported by Yin,
and embraced by Yang.
These energies blending in harmony.

I teach what everyone else teaches:
Those who rule by force will surely die.
I will take this as the root of my teaching.
