Both favor and disgrace come as a shock.
Respect great suffering as part of life.

Why is it said:
“Both favor and disgrace come as a shock?”
When we get it, it is shocking, and when we lose it, it is shocking.
That is why it is said:
“Both favor and disgrace come as a shock.”

Why is it said:
“Respect great suffering as part of life?”
I experience suffering because I am alive.
If I were not alive what suffering could I experience?
That is why it is said:
“Respect great suffering as part of life.”

So it is that:
Those who value their own lives
can be trusted to care for the world,
and those who love their own lives
can be trusted to cherish the world.
