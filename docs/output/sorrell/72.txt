People who live fearlessly, gain the greatest personal power.
Do not take advantage of others, and do not despise their lives.
If we do not despise them, they will not despise us.

Therefore wise people know themselves
without having to assert themselves.
They love themselves without being vain.
For this reason they reject that and choose this.
