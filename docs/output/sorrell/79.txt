If, when righting a great wrong,
some resentment will always remain,
how can one do the right thing?

It is for this reason that wise people keep their side of the bargain,
while making no demands on others.
The righteous fulfill their obligations,
while the wicked insist on collecting their due.

To follow the Way of Heaven is not to play favorites
and always to side with the good.
