Absolute perfection appears to be lacking something,
and yet its use is not impaired.
Great abundance seems empty,
and yet it is inexhaustible.

True directness seems crooked.
True skill appears awkward.
Accomplished debate sounds inarticulate.

Movement overcomes cold.
Stillness overcomes heat.
Clarity and tranquillity make everything right in the world.
