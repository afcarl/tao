Those who use weapons say:
I do not try to take the offensive but would rather take the defensive.
I do not try, to advance an inch but would rather retreat a foot.

This is called: making no moves, not spoiling for a fight;
challenging no opponent, nor wielding any weapon.
There is no greater disaster than taking the enemy lightly.
If I take the enemy lightly I am close to losing my treasures.

When opposing armies are evenly matched,
the one that feels pity will gain the victory.
