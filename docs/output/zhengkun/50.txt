Men live when given to birth
And die when being buried.
One third of them are long-lived;
One third of them are short-lived;
One third of them die from their own choices though they could have lived longer;
Why in such cases?
Because they are too eager to live longer.
It is heard that he who is good at preserving his life
Does not meet with the rhinoceros or tiger when traveling on land,
Nor is he wounded in war,
For the rhinoceros has no use for its horns
And the tiger has no use for its claws;
The weapons have no use for their blades.
Why in such cases?
Because there is no realm of death for him to enter.
