Heaviness is the root of lightness.
Tranquillity is the lord of movement.
That is why the sage is always accompanied by his heavily laden cart
When he travels all day long.
Though he has a luxurious life to enjoy,
He never indulges himself in it.
Why should a ruler of ten thousand chariots
Take reckless action to govern the empire?
Lightness leads to the loss of the root;
Restlessness leads to the loss of the lord.
