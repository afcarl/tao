Does not the Tao of heaven resemble the bending of a bow (aiming):
Pressing down the high,
Lifting up the low,
Reducing the excessive,
Compensating the deficient?
So the Tao of heaven means to compensate the deficient by reducing the excess.
The Tao of man is different:
It gives to one who already has more than enough by taking from one who is in want.
Who can offer what he has in excess to the people?
Only the man of Tao.
Thus the sage
Benefits all things without claiming to be their benefactor;
Succeeds without claiming credit;
Because he does not want to show off his wisdom.
