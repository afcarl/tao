What is well planted cannot be pulled out;
What is well held cannot be disengaged;
The principle being observed,
The offering of sacrifice by descendants will be kept making for ever.
Similarly cultivating the principle in oneself,
One can purify his virtue;
Cultivating it in the family,
One makes his own virtue more than enough;
Cultivating it in the village,
One can have the virtue to be the leader;
Cultivating it in the state,
One can have the prodigious virtue;
Cultivating it in the world,
One can have the virtue widely known.
Hence I can have an insight
Into other individuals by examining myself;
Into other families by examining my family;
Into other villages by examining my village;
Into other states by examining my state;
Into other worlds by examining my world.
How do I know about the whole world?
By employing the method above.
