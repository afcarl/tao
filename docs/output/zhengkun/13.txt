Honor and disgrace are both startling.
It is like cherishing great trouble (vanity) as one's life and body.
What is meant by saying that honor and disgrace are startling?
Honor itself, though mean, gives pleasant surprise to those who obtain it
As well as startles them when they lose it.
What is meant by saying that it is like cherishing great trouble as one's life and body?
Because my life and body is the very source of great trouble.
If I have no body and life,
What trouble can I suffer?
Thus he who can value the empire as he values his own life and body
Can be entrusted with the care of the empire.
Thus he who can cherish the empire as he cherishes his own life and body
Can be entrusted with the care of the empire.
