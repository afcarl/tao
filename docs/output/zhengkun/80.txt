The state should be small;
The population should be sparse.
Tools, though of many kinds,
Should not be used.
Teach the people to fear death
And not to migrate to remote places;
Although they have ships and carts,
They will have no need to use them;
Although they are well armed with weapons,
They will have no place to make them effective.
Encourage the people to return to the condition
Under which the knotted rope was used to record things.
The world best ruled is a place where
The people will have delicious food,
beautiful clothes,
comfortable living quarters,
cheerful customs.
Though within easy reach of neighbouring states,
The dog's barking and the cock's crowing in one state are heard in another;
The people of one state will never have dealings with those of another,
Even if they get old and die.
