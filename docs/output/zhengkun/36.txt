If you want a thing to contract,
You should stretch it first;
If you want a thing weakened,
You should strengthen it first;
If you want a thing gotten rid of,
You should promote it first;
If you want a thing taken away,
You should give to it first.
These are called subtle wisdom.
The supple and weak overcomes the rigid and strong.
Fish should not be allowed to leave the deep water;
The instruments of power of a state
Should not be shown to the public.
