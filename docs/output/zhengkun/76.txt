While alive, a man's body is supple;
When dead, it becomes hard.
While alive, grass and trees are supple;
When dead, they become dry and stiff.
Thus the hard and strong is of the dying sort;
The supple and weak is of the living sort.
That is why the army, having grown strong, will be wiped out,
And the tree, when grown up, will be cut down.
Thus the strong and big is inferior
To the weak and supple.
