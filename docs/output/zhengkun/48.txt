He who seeks learning must increase his knowledge every day;
He who seeks the Tao must reduce his knowledge every day;
He reduces and reduces until he reaches the state of inaction.
When reaching the state of inaction, one can succeeds in everything.
To govern the world well, one must take inaction as the principle.
If one governs with too much action, one is not a worthy governor.
