He who assists the ruler by means of the Tao
Does not conquer other countries by the military force.
Military actions usually invite retaliatory aftermath:
Wherever armies station,
Thistles and thorns grow;
A great war is always followed
By a great famine.
He who is well versed in the art of war
Only uses the force to win the war,
And not to bully or conquer other countries.
Win the war but do not boast;
Win the war but do not brag;
Win the war but do not show arrogance;
Win the war but do know it is out of necessity;
Win the war but do not thereby bully and conquer other countries.
Whatever is in its prime is bound to decline;
For, being in prime is against the Tao;
Whatever goes against the Tao
Will come to an early end.
