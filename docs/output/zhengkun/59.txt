The best way to govern the state and keep in good health
Is to stint vitality.
To stint vitality means to attempt an early preparation;
The early preparation means to keep accumulating virtue;
Keep accumulating virtue and one can become all-conquering;
Be all-conquering and one's power will be beyond measure;
When one's power is beyond measure,
He can be entrusted with the duty of defending the state.
When there is the principle of governing the state,
The government can long endure.
This is called the Tao of deep roots and sturdy stems
By which one can live and see longer time.
