Which is dearer, your name or your body?
Which is more important, your body or your goods?
Which is more harmful, gain or loss?
Excessive stinginess will result in great expense;
Too much amassment leads to great loss;
Knowing contentment avoids disgrace;
Knowing when to stop avoids danger.
Thus one can be long in safety.
