The universe has a beginning (Tao);
The beginning functions as the mother of all things.
If you know the mother,
You can get to know her children (all things);
If, while knowing the children,
You keep the mother,
You will be a sage all your life.
Block the openings (of knowledge),
Shut the door (of desires),
And you will be free from illness all your life.
Unlock the openings,
Add to your cares,
And you will be incurable all your life.
To be able to perceive the minute is called discernment;
To be able to play the role of the weak is called the strong.
Use the light
To return to the intrinsic discernment
And you will be free from disasters.
This is called the eternal Tao.
