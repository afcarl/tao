A strategist says:
I dare not launch an attack but strengthen defense capabilities;
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead.
This means to deploy battle array by showing no battle array;
To wield one's arm to attack by showing no arm to lift;
To face the enemy by showing no enemy to attack;
To hold weapons by showing no weapons to hold.
No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy.
Underestimating the enemy nearly cost me my treasure (i. e. three treasured weapons, see 67).
That is why the sorrow-laden side wins
When two armies are at war.
