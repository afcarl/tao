A man of prodigious virtue is just like a newly-born baby:
Poisonous insects will not sting it;
Beasts of prey will not harm it;
Birds of prey will not swoop down upon it.
Its bones and muscles are weak and supple,
Yet its hold is tight.
It does not know sexual intercourse between the male and female,
Yet its little penis often erects itself;
This is because it is at the height of virility.
It cries all day long,
Yet its throat does not become hoarse;
This is because it is at the height of harmonious vim and vigor.
To know harmony is to know the law of unity;
To know the law of unity is to know discernment;
To indulge in sensual pleasures is to look for disasters;
To let virility driven by desires is to give free rein to strength.
A creature in its prime is at the turning-point of being old,
For it is against the Tao.
What is against the Tao comes to an early end.
