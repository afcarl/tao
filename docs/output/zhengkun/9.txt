One should stop in due time
Rather than fill it to the brim.
When a point is whittled too sharp,
Its sharpness cannot remains long.
When a hall is full of gold and jade,
Nobody can keep them long;
When a man of wealth and rank is arrogant,
He is looking for a calamity upon himself;
When one succeeds and subsequently retires,
He follows the true way of heaven.
