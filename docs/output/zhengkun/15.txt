Those ancients who were well versed in the Tao
Were so subtle, mysterious and profound
As to escape understanding.
As they were beyond comprehension,
The description of them is surely perfunctory;
careful as if fording a river barefoot in winter;
vigilant and hesitant as if in fear of the attacks from neighbours;
formal as if they were guests;
polishedly flowing like melting ice;
simple and natural like the uncarved block;
vacant and deep like a valley;
turbid like muddy water;
quiet and calm like the great sea;
drifting as if they would never stop.
Who can end the muddiness
And make the muddy settle and gradually become clear?
Who can be at rest and yet, stirring, slowly come to life?
He who is in possession of this Tao
Will not seek completeness.
Just because he will not seek completeness,
He can be both old and new.
