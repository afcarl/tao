The Tao is invisibly empty,
But its use is extremely plentiful.
It is profound like the originator of all things.
It shows no sharpness,
stays away from entanglements,
glows with veiled radiance,
mingles with dust.
It is formless and invisible, but indeed exists.
I do not know where it comes,
It seems to have appeared before the existence of God.
