All the streamlets flow towards the river and the sea
Because the latter takes the lower positions,
Hence the latter becomes the king of countless valleys.
Therefore, if one wants to be the ruler of the people,
One must put oneself behind the people.
Thus the sage, though being placed high over the people,
Never burdens the people;
The sage, though going ahead of the people,
Never stands in the way of the people.
That is why the people hold him in esteem
And are never tired of him.
He contends with no one,
So no one in the world is able to contend with him.
