Heaven and earth exist for ever.
This eternal existence is justified by the fact
That they do not exist for themselves.
Thus they enjoy an eternal life.
The sage similarly puts himself behind others,
Yet it turns out that he comes before others;
He completely disregards his own existence,
And yet it turns out that his existence is preserved.
