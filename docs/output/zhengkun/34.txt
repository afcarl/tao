The great Tao is felt everywhere
Extending in all directions.
All things grow on it and it never declines them.
It accomplishes its great task without claiming to merit.
It breeds all things without claiming to be their master;
It can be called the Small.
All things finally return to it
And it never claims to be their master;
And it can be called the Great.
It becomes the Great
Because it never claims to be the Great.
