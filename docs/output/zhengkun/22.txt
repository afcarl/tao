Bow down and you are preserved;
Bend and you can be straight;
Hollow, then full;
Worn, then new;
Seek a little and you get a lot;
Seek a lot and you get perplexed.
Thus the sage adheres to this One principle (Tao)
And regards it as the pattern of all things.
Show off yourself not and you become conspicuous;
Regard yourself not as infallible and you become illustrious;
Brag about yourself not and you gain achievement;
Boast of yourself not and you become a head.
One does not contend with others,
So nobody in the world can win him in contention.
The ancients' saying "Bow down and you are preserved"
Is surely not an empty saying,
Which can be really proved effective.
