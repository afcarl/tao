Hearing the Tao, the best scholar assiduously practices it;
The average scholar half believes and half doubts it;
The worst scholar bursts into laughter about it.
If the worst scholar does not laugh about it,
The Tao is not worthy of being called the Tao.
That is why the ancients say:
The bright Tao seems dark;
The advancing Tao seems to be retreating;
The even Tao seems rough;
The great virtue resembles the valley;
The pure whiteness seems black;
The infinite virtue seems lacking;
The virile virtue seems idle;
The pure simplicity seems turbid;
The great square has no corners;
Of the utensils the most precious takes the longest time to be finished;
The great sound seems soundless;
The great image seems formless.
The Tao always conceals itself without a name,
But it is the Tao alone that helps and completes everything.
