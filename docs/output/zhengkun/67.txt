The whole world says that my Tao is great,
Resembling nothing concrete,
Resembling nothing concrete,
Just because it is great.
If it resembled anything concrete,
It would have long become minute.
I have three magic weapons
Which I hold and treasure:
The first is mercy;
The second is thrift;
The third is unwillingness to take the lead in the world.
Being merciful, one can be brave;
Being thrifty, one can be generous;
Being unwilling to take the lead in the world, one can become the leader of the world.
Now seeking bravery by giving up mercy,
Seeking generosity by giving up thrift,
Seeking advance by giving up retreat,
One is bound to end in death.
Being merciful, one will triumph in the offensive
And be impregnable in defense.
If heaven wants to save one,
It must save him with mercy.
