Discard cleverness and wisdom
And the people will benefit themselves a hundredfold;
Discard benevolence and rectitude
And the people will again become filial and loyal;
Discard ingenuity and profit
And theft will no longer exist.
It is not enough to have these points as governing principles,
So the people must be made subject to the following:
Keep being simple in nature and mind,
Discard selfishness and weaken desires,
Discard cultural knowledge and worries will disappear.
