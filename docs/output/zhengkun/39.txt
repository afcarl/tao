Among the ancient holders of the One:
Heaven that holds the One becomes clear and bright;
Earth that holds the One becomes steady;
Gods that hold the One become efficacious;
Valleys that hold the One become full;
All creatures that hold the One become alive;
Lords and leaders who hold the One become leaders of the human world.
By inference Heaven might split without what makes it clear and bright;
Earth might shake without what makes it steady;
Gods might disappear without what makes them efficacious;
Valleys might go dry without what makes them full;
All creatures might die out without what makes them alive;
Lords and kings might fall without what makes them leaders.
That is why the humble is the root of the noble,
And the high is based on the low.
That is why lords and kings call themselves "the solitary", "the few" and "the unkind".
Does not this take the humble as the root (of the noble)?
Does this not?
Hence the highest honor does not need honoring.
It is better, therefore, to be a hard stone than a beautiful piece of jade.
