He who stands on tiptoes cannot stand well;
He who walks with great strides cannot walk well;
He who shows off himself cannot become conspicuous;
He who regards himself infallible cannot become illustrious;
He who brags about himself cannot gain achievement;
He who boasts of himself cannot become a head.
From the point of view of the Tao,
These behaviours are like leftover food and superfluous excrescence,
So disgusting that a man of Tao
Never behaves like that.
