How much difference is seen
Between Yes and No?
How much disparity is shown
Between good and evil?
What other people fear
One must fear;
What a difference - so vast and endless!
The multitude are jubilant
As if enjoying a magnificent feast
Or ascending a terrace to command a view of spring scene.
While I, alone and inactive, remain aloof and indifferent,
Like a baby that has not yet learned to smile;
I am tired, like a homeless wanderer.
The multitude all have more than enough,
While I, alone, seem to have nothing.
I am one, indeed, with a heart of a fool.
Vulgar people all look sober and complacent,
While I alone seem muddleheaded.
The multitude all appear clever and capable,
While I alone seem slow-witted and clumsy.
I am indeed different from them all
Because I take the greatest interest in obtaining the Tao.
