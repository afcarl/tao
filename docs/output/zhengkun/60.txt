Ruling a large state resembles frying a small fish
(It is inappropriate to turn it over frequently).
When the Tao prevails in the world,
Even ghosts and spirits become harmless.
It is not that ghosts become harmless
But that their potencies can no longer harm people.
Not only ghosts become harmless,
Sages harm no people either.
Hence neither does any harm to the people
And both sages and ghosts help the people to enjoy the benefit of virtue.
