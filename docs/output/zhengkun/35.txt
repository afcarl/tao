He who holds the great image (Tao)
Attracts all the people to him.
Coming to him and not harming each other,
They all live in peace and happiness.
Music and food
Can allure passersby to stop,
But the Tao, coming out of the mouth,
Is tasteless.
It cannot be seen,
It cannot be heard,
But when using it, you can never exhaust its use.
