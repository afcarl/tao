When the great enmity is allayed,
There must be some remaining hostility;
Even if one requites hostility with kindness,
How can that be considered perfect?
Therefore the sage keeps the stub of the receipt for a loan
But never presses for payment from people.
A man of virtue is as tolerant as the sage who keeps the stub of the receipt;
A man of no virtue is as harsh as tax collectors.
The Tao of heaven never shows favouritism;
It always helps those who are good.
