The Tao always remains inactive,
Yet it acts upon everything in the world.
If lords and kings can keep it,
All creatures will grow and develop naturally.
When desires are kindled in the growth and development,
I can suppress them with the nameless Simplicity of the Tao.
Once I do so
Desires will be repressed.
Once desires are repressed,
The whole world will be naturally at peace.
