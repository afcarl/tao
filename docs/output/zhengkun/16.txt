I try my best to be in an extreme emptiness of mind;
I try to keep myself in a state of stillness.
From the vigorous growth of all things I perceive the way they move in endless cycles.
All things, full of vitality,
Finally return to their own roots.
Returning to roots means stillness,
Also means a return to destiny.
A return to destiny is known as the law of eternity.
To understand the law is known as enlightening.
He who is ignorant of the law, if acting rashly,
Will be in great trouble.
But he who knows the law is tolerant,
And the tolerance leads to impartiality;
Impartiality to thoroughness;
Thoroughness to nature;
Nature to the Tao;
The Tao to eternity.
Thus he will not be endangered all his life.
