The whole world knows the beautiful as beautiful
Only because of the existence of the ugly;
The whole world knows the good as good
Only because of the existence of the bad.
Hence the Being and the Nothingness exist in opposition;
The difficult and the easy complement each other;
The long and the short manifest themselves by comparison;
The high and the low are inclined as well as opposed to each other;
The consonants and vowels harmonize with each other;
The front and the back follow each other.
Thus the sage behaves
Without taking active action,
Teaches without using words,
Lets all things rip without interference,
Gives them life without claiming to be their owner,
Benefits them without claiming to be their benefactor, succeeds without claiming credit.
Because he does not claim credit,
His credit is never lost.
