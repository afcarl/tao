The five colours make man blind;
The five sounds make man deaf;
The five tastes make man lose his sense of taste;
Riding and hunting make man wild with excitement;
Rare goods goad man into stealing;
Thus the sage does not satisfy his eyes with colours
But satisfy his stomach with enough food.
He discards the former and takes the latter.
