When the Tao prevails in the world,
The battle steeds are returned to farmers for tilling the fields;
When the Tao does not prevail in the world,
Even pregnant mares are taken over for wars.
No crime is greater than greediness;
No disaster is greater than the lack of contentment;
Thus the contentment of feeling content
Is an eternal contentment.
