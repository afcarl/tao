When the people are not afraid of death,
What is the point of threatening them with death?
Should the people really fear death,
Who dare go against laws
If we put to death those who do evils?
It is the duty of a regular executioner to kill,
If one wants to kill on behalf of the executioner,
It is like chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter.
There are few who can escape cutting their own hands
When they chop wood on behalf of the master carpenter.
