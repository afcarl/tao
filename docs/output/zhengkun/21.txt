The forms of the great the Teh (virtue)
Exclusively depend on the Tao.
The Tao as a thing
Is vague and indefinite.
Vague and indefinite,
It presents images;
Indefinite and vague,
It embodies substance.
Distant and dark,
It embraces semen-like essence.
The essence is a genuine existence
That can be tested as true.
From ancient times to now,
Its name has always been accepted,
And with which, the beginning of all things can be surveyed.
How do I know the initial state of all things?
By means of the Tao.
