Arms are tools of ill omen,
Detested by everybody.
And a man of the Tao does not use them.
The gentleman usually favours the left,
But when being at war, he favours the right.
Arms are tools of ill omen,
Not the instruments of the gentleman.
Even if compelled to use them,
The gentleman does not use them with pleasure.
Even if being the victor,
The gentleman does not glorify the victory.
He who glorifies the victory
Is such one as takes delight in killing.
He who takes delight in killing
Can never be successful in winning the empire.
On occasions of auspicious celebration the left is favoured;
On occasions of mourning the right is favoured.
A lieutenant's position is on the left;
A general's position is on the right.
That is to say, mourning rites should be observed in military operations.
War brings about heavy casualties,
So one should take part in it with deep sorrow.
When winning the victory, victors should treat the dead by observing the rites of mourning.
