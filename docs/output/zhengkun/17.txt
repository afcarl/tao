The best ruler is unknown to his subjects;
Next comes the ruler loved and praised;
Next comes the ruler being feared;
Next comes the ruler disdained.
The lack of faith on the part of the ruler
Leads to the lack of confidence in him on the part of the people.
The best ruler is leisurely and carefree, seldom issuing orders.
When the state affairs are properly dealt with,
The people all say, "It should have happened to us like this."
