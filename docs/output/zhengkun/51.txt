The Tao begets all creatures;
The virtue rears them;
Substance gives them shape;
Forces in opposition accomplish them.
Therefore all creatures worship the Tao and honor virtue.
This worship and honor stems from the fact
That the Tao and virtue never unnaturally
Impose their influence on all creatures.
In this way
The Tao begets all creatures;
The virtue rears them,
Promotes them, natures them,
Brings them to fruition and maturity,
Meanwhile maintains and defends them.
Giving them life without claiming to be their owner;
Availing them without claiming to be their benefactor;
And being their head without ruling them;
All these are called the most intrinsic Teh (virtue).
