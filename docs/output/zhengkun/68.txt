He who is good at being a commander
Does not display his bravery;
He who is good at fighting
Does not burst into anger;
He who is good at defeating his enemy
Does not brace himself to engage in a tough battle;
He who is good at employing men
Humbles himself before them;
This is called the virtue of non-contention;
This is called making use of others' strength;
This is called conformability to the Tao of heaven.
