The complete perfection seems flawed,
But its use can never be exhausted;
The fullest seems empty,
But its use can never come to an end;
The straightest seems bent;
The most skillful seems clumsy;
The most eloquent seems tongue-tied.
Movement overcomes cold;
Quiet overcomes heat.
So inaction and quiet help one
Become a leader of the world.
