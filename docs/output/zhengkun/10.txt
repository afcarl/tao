Body and soul are one,
But can they avoid separation?
Though concentrating on breathing exercises to be supple,
Can you become as supple as a baby?
Though getting rid of your distracting thoughts for a deeper meditation,
Can you be devoid of blemish?
If you are to love the people and govern a state,
Can you avoid taking active action?
When the door of heaven opens or closes,
Can you remain inactive as a female?
When your power of perception penetrates every corner,
Are you capable of knowing nothing?
Giving all things life and propagation
Without claiming to be their owner,
Benefiting them without claiming to be their benefactor,
And being their head without ruling them,
All these are called the most intrinsic Teh (virtue).
