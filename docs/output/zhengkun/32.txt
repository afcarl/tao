The Tao is nameless for ever.
Though it is very small,
It is subject to no one in the world.
If lords and kings can keep it,
They can bring all things in the world under subjection.
When the Yin and Yang between heaven and earth unite,
Sweet dew will fall, so equally scattered down
Without any interference on the part of the people.
The administration of the empire demands names;
Names are once given,
Limitations are thereby known.
The knowledge of limitations helps avoid danger.
The Tao is to the world what the river and the sea
Are to the countless streamlets.
