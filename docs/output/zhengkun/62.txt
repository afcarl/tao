The Tao is the innermost recess of all things;
It is what the good man cherishes
As well as what the bad man wants to keep.
With the Tao, beautiful words can buy respect;
Beautiful deeds can be highly regarded.
How can the bad man desert the Tao?
Hence when the emperor ascends the throne and appoints three ducal ministers,
It would be better to present to the emperor the Tao than jade disks followed by a team of four horses.
Why did ancients value the Tao so much?
Was it not said that by making use of the Tao
One could get what one desired
Or avoid punishment when committing an offense?
That is why it is valued so mush in the world.
