A stable situation is easy to be maintained;
A condition without the sign of apparent change is easy to be coped with;
A fragile thing is easy to break;
A minute thing is easy to dissolve.
The proper treatment should be given to what has happened;
Keep things in order before disorder sets in.
A huge tree grows from a tiny seedling;
A nine-storey terrace rises from a mound of earth;
A journey of a thousand li starts from beneath one's feet.
Those who wants to obtain it by force will ruin it;
Those who hold it by force will lose it.
Thus the sage never ruins anything,
Because of his inaction;
He never loses anything.
In doing things,
People often fail on the verge of success.
If they are as prudent at the end as at the beginning,
They will never fail.
That is why the sage
Desires what others do not desire,
Values not rare goods,
Learns to lack learning,
Makes up for people's faults.
In this way he helps all things develop naturally
And refrains from interfering in them.
