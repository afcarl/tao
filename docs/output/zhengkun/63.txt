Act by means of inaction;
Deal with matters by means of not being meddlesome;
Taste by means of tastelessness.
The big stems from the small;
The many is based on the few.
To overcome the difficult should begin with the easy;
To accomplish what is big should begin with the small.
The difficult things in the world must originate in the easy;
The big things in the world must take root in the small.
That is why the sage can accomplish what is great by never attempting to be great.
Light promise-giving, light promise-breaking;
The easier one considers things, the more difficult things become.
That is why the sage never meets with difficulty
Because he always considers things difficult.
