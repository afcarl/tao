What cannot be seen is called "Yi" (without colour);
What cannot be heard is called "Xi" (without sound);
What cannot be touched is called "Wei" (without shape);

Above it there is no light;
Below it there is no darkness;
So vague as to defy any description.

And is called the shape without shape as well as the image without substance.
It is hence named as "huhuang" (vague and dimly visible).
Facing it, you cannot see its front;
Following it, you cannot see its back.
To control the present Being (substance) by employing the Tao of ancient time,
One knows the beginning of the universe.
And this is called the law of the Tao.
