He who is good at walking leaves no traces;
He who is good at speaking leaves no slips;
He who is good at counting uses no counting tools;
He who is good at shutting renders all efforts of opening in vain though he uses no bolts;
He who is good at tying renders all efforts of untying in vain though he uses no ropes.
That is why the sage
Is always good at saving people
And abandoning no one;
That is why the sage is always good at saving things
And abandoning nothing.
This is called the intrinsic wisdom.
Thus the good man is the bad man's teacher;
The bad man is the material from which the good draws lessons.
If honouring not one's teacher,
Or loving not one's material,
One is a big fool though he seems clever.
Here lies the vital secret.
