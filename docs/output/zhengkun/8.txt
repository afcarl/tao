The perfect goodness is like water.
Water approaches all things instead of contending with them.
It prefers to dwell where no one would like to stay;
Hence it comes close to the Tao.
A man of perfect goodness chooses a low place to dwell as water,
He has a heart as deep as water,
He offers friendship as tender as water,
He speaks as sincerely as water,
He rules a state as orderly as water,
He does a thing as properly as water,
He takes action as timely as water.
Like water, he never contends with others,
So he never commits a mistake.
