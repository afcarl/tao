Rule the state with peace and inaction;
Wage a war with crafty tricks;
Governing the world by not troubling the people.
How do I know it is the right way?
The reason is as follows:
The more prohibitions there are in the world,
The poorer the people;
The more weapons the people own,
The more chaotic the state;
The more skills the people have,
The more strange things occur;
The more laws and orders are issued,
The more thieves and robbers there are.
Thus the sage says,
If I prefer inaction,
The people will naturally crave for peace;
If I act little,
The people will be naturally rectified;
If I am not meddlesome,
The people will naturally become rich;
If I get rid of desires,
The people will naturally become simple.
