Those ancient men of the profound Tao
Did not use the Tao to enlighten the people
But use the Tao to make them simple.
The people are unruly
Because they are too clever.
Thus to govern a state by cleverness
Is bound to ruin the state;
Not to govern the state by cleverness
Is a blessing to the state.
These are two models of government;
Keeping the knowledge of these two models
Is known as the mysterious virtue.
The mysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,
Running counter to concrete things.
At their extremes there is the most complete conformity to nature.
