There is a thing integratedly formed
And born earlier than heaven and earth.
Silent and empty,
It relies on nothing,
Moving around for ever.
We may regard it as the mother of all things.
I do not know its name,
So I name it as the Tao,
And further name it as the Great.
The Great is moving forward without stopping,
Extending to the remotest distance,
And then returning to where it was.
That is why I say
The Tao is Great;
Heaven is Great;
Earth is Great;
And man is also Great.
There are four things that are Great,
Of them man is one.
Man takes earth as his model;
Earth takes heaven as its model;
Heaven takes the Tao as its model;
The Tao takes what is natural as its model.
