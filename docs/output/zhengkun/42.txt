The Tao begets the One;
The One consists of Two in opposition (the Yin and Yang);
The Two begets the Three;
The Three begets all things of the world.
All things connote the Yin and Yang.
The Yin and Yang keep acting upon each other
And thus things keep changing and unifying themselves.
Words like "the solitary", "the few" and "the unkind"
Are usually detested by people,
Yet lords and kings use them to call themselves.
That is why
A thing is sometimes added to when being reduced,
Or is reduced when being added to.
So I teach what I am taught:
"The violent will not come to a good end."
This I will take as the first lesson when I teach.
