He who is wise will not speak;
He who speaks is not wise.
When one blocks the openings (of knowledge),
Shuts the door (of desires),
Dulls sharpness,
Stays away from entanglements,
Glows with veiled radiance,
Mingles with dust,
That is called subtle identification.
Hence you are in no way
To be friends with him,
To estrange him,
To benefit him,
To harm him,
To honor him,
To debase him.
That is why he is held in esteem in the world.
