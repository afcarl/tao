Keep the people from contention by disregarding men of abilities;
Keep the people from theft by not valuing rare goods;
Keep the people from the disturbed state of mind by concealing what is desirable.
That is why in governing the people
The sage simplifies their minds but fills up their stomachs;
weakens their wills, but strengthens their bones.
By keeping the people from knowledge and desires,
He disables wise men from taking any active action.
Act in accordance with this principle of inaction
And the world will be kept in order everywhere.
