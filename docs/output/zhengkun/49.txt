The sage often has no will,
He takes the people's will as his own.
What is good I treat with goodness;
What is not good I also treat with goodness.
Thus I obtain goodness.
Those who are of faith, I put faith in;
Those who are of no faith, I also put faith in.
Thus I obtain faith.
When the sage governs the world,
He simplifies his as well as the people's minds.
The people are all preoccupied with their eyes and ears,
The sage helps them return to the childhood state.
