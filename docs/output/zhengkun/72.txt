When the people are not afraid of the threatening might of the authority,
The great tumult will soon ensue.
Do not harass their living places;
Do not deprive them of their means of livelihood.
If you do not oppress the people,
The people will not be tired of you (the ruler).
Hence the sage knows himself but does not praise himself;
loves himself but does not honor himself.
That is why he discards the latter and takes the former.
