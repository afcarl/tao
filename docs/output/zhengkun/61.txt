A large state should play the role of female,
Just like the lowest reaches of a river
Where all the other streams meet.
The female always conquers the male by motionlessness,
Because the motionless female always takes the lower position.
Hence the large state can annex the small one by taking the lower position (being modest);
The small state can gain the trust of the large one by taking the lower position,
The case being either the former or vice versa.
The large state wants to put the small one under its protection,
The small state wants to be shielded by the large one,
Thus both can satisfy their wishes,
But the large state should be more willing to take the lower position.
