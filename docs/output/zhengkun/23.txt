To be taciturn is in accordance with nature,
So much as a wanton wind
Does not last all morning,
And a sudden rain does not last all day.
Who makes it?
Heaven and earth.
If heaven and earth cannot make it last long,
How can man?
So a man of Tao conforms to the Tao;
A man of Teh to the Teh;
A man of having neither to the principle of losing both above.
He who conforms to the Tao is readily received by the Tao;
He who conforms to the Teh is readily received by the Teh;
He who conforms to the principle of losing both above is readily discarded by the principle of loss.
The lack of faith on the part of the ruler
Leads to the lack of confidence in him on the part of the people.
