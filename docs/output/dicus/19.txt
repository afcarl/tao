If we could discard knowledge and wisdom,
then the people would be a hundred times happier.
If we could renounce our kindness and discard our righteousness;
the people's harmonious relationships and love would form of their own accord.
If cunning and profit were renounced, stealing and fraud would disappear.
Since the above three are merely words and slogans, they are not sufficient as they are lost in the world of man.
Therefore we must look to that to which they belong:
Cultivate simplicity and be like the uncarved wooden block.
Reduce your selfishness and diminish desire and ambition.
Stop worthless learning and you will reduce vexations of the spirit.
