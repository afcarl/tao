When the people are no longer afraid of death, why threaten them with the executioner?
If the people feared death, and execution was imposed as a penalty; who would dare transgress The Law?
Heaven is the Master Executioner.
Whoever tries to take Heavens place is like an amateur trying to use the master carpenters' tools to hew wood,
if he tries to use the tools he will likely hew himself.
