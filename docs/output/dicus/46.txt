When the world is in accord with the Tao horses work and fertilize the fields with their droppings,
When The Way is forgotten, warhorses are bred and feed on the people's autumn harvest in the parks of the suburbs.
There is no worse calamity than desire,
There is no greater misery than knowing no contentment,
There is no greater catastrophe than losing self-control.
Contentment can come from realizing one has enough,
Attaining contentment, one can attain internal peace.
