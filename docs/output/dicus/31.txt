Instruments of war, however splendidly built can cause destruction and horror.
They should be regarded as inauspicious instruments, the use of which should be avoided in all but the direst necessity, and utilized with the utmost restraint.
The King looks to His minister of Peace on His left, and leans to His General on His right.
On happy occasions the left is the prized position, in times of war the right is honored.
Peace and stillness are dear to the heart of the followers of Tao,

Do not rejoice in victory, for such is to delight in the slaughter of men.
Enter a battle gravely, for the dead come from the people, and deep and great will be their lamentation.
A battle should be regarded as the beginning of the funeral.
