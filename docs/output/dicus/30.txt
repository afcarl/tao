If you guide your nation by use of the Tao,
You will not rule it by use of military arms.
For even well-intentioned aggression
Has a way of returning to oneself.
Thorns and brambles grow thickly where an army has camped.
And years of destitution are likely after a great war.
When necessary; the skillful leader will strike a decisive blow and achieve a lasting victory.
He will guard against vain, boastful or arrogant thoughts in the aftermath of the destruction.
He will accomplish only the killing and destruction that is necessary,
and not the least bit more.
Things flourish, and then they decline,
This is the way of the Tao.
