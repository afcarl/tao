Success is as dangerous as failure.
Hope is as hollow as fear.
What does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure?
Perceptions of success and failure both arise from concern for the self.
What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?
Hope and fear are both phantoms,
they also arise from thinking of the self.
When we don't see the self as self,
what do we have to fear?
Therefore, if you dedicate your life to the benefit of the world,
you can rely on the world.
To the likes of this, the world can be entrusted.
