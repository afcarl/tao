We join spokes together in a hub,
but it is the center hole that provides the utility of the wheel.
We form clay into a container,
but it is the emptiness inside
that holds whatever we want.
We build walls for a house,
But it is the empty space inside
that we live in.
Therefore: we work with being,
But it is in non-being that there is true usefulness.
