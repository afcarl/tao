Looked at it cannot be seen - it is beyond form; and is seen as remote.
Listened to it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound; it is indistinct.
Reach for it, and you cannot grasp it. It is beyond reach and is ephemeral.
These unknowable things evade definition,
And blend into a single mystery,
called The Tao.
Its top is not bright;
Its bottom is not dark;
faultless, unnamable,
it returns to the realm of nothing.
Thus, it is called the formless form,
The image with nothing to see,
something subtle, beyond all conception.
Draw near it and there is no beginning;
chase after it and there is no end.
By holding to the ancient Tao
You can manage current existence
And know the ancient beginnings.
This is called the very beginning thread of the Tao.
