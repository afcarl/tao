One who is abundant in virtue is much like a newborn child; bees, scorpions and snakes will not sting or bite such a one.
Wild beasts will not sink claws into the infant, nor will birds of prey strike a blow.
Though his bones be soft, and his sinews be weak, his grip will be strong.
The infant doesn't yet know of the union between male and female,
yet this one is perfectly formed, the ultimate in vitality.
Babbling and screaming all day, he does not become hoarse; this shows the harmony of the infant.
To know virtue and harmony like this, to keep it constant, this is illumination.
To try to force life: this bodes ill. To try to exceed nature brings calamity. To try to control nature brings violence.
And things that are over luxurious, overgrown and extremely fecund are not in keeping with the Tao. These things will wither and perish.
