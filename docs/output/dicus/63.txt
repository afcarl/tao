The Tao can accomplish much without interfering,
it can achieve without forcing,
it can taste the tasteless.
Large or small, many or few,
repay hatred and injury with virtue and compassion.
Accomplish the hard task while it is still easy.
Handle large affairs while they are still small.
For even the most difficult and large of tasks and affairs have a point where they are still easy and small.
Thus it is that the Master never does anything hard or large,
yet he is able to accomplish a great many things.
A rashly made promise oftentimes is not carried through.
And those who think all will be easy do not prepare, and find the way difficult.
So the sage regards all things as being difficult, he prepares,
thus it is that he experiences less difficulty with them.
