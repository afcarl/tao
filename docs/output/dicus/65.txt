The ancient practitioners of the Tao did not try to educate or enlighten the people;
they led them instead to a return to a natural simplicity.
The more sophisticated the people, the harder it is to control and rule them.
It follows also that a clever ruler can be a scourge to his nation.
Therefore it is a blessing to the nation and the people if the rulers and the people alike are simple,
unsophisticated, and full of the virtue of the Tao.
To know these two things is to have a rule and a model to guide oneself, and to guide the nation.
And to understand the rule and the model is to be practicing the mystical virtue.
This deep and profound mystical virtue is so far reaching;
it causes all things to return to the source of harmony.
