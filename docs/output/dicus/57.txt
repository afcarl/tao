Rule the kingdom with justice. Use surprise tactics to fight a war.
But it takes letting go to win and hold the world.
How do I know it is so? Through this: -
The more restrictive the laws in the kingdom, the poorer the people will be.
The more sharp weapons the people have, the more troubled and chaotic the state will be
and the less secure the people will be.
The more clever and advanced the people, the stranger the contrivances they will invent.
Law after law promulgates robbers and thieves.
Therefore the Master says: "I will let go of the law,
and the people will act rightly of their own accord,
I will love tranquility and the people will act with righteousness."
"I will make no effort, and the people will prosper.
I will let go of all of my desires, and the people will return to native simplicity."
