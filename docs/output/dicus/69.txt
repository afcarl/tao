The military veteran has a saying, "rather then rushing in, it is better to wait to see what they will do".
They also say: "Rather than advancing an inch at great cost, it is better to retreat a foot and spare life".
This is advancing without wasting energy, effort and life.
It is like pushing back without using force.
Its semblance is that of engaging the enemy without actually invading them.
Surely there is no greater calamity in war than that of thinking too little of your enemy.
Underestimating him can lead to disaster and the loss of the three treasures of compassion,
economy and the desire not to be first.
When opposing armies clash in the field, the victory will go to the one with compassion for the people,
both his and the enemy's.
He who has the greatest economy in the use of all things will be able to better maintain the expenses of marches and provisions.
The desire not to be first will result in calculating actions, and the deferral of reckless abandon.
