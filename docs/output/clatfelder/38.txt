You needn't search for power
You already have it all
To seek outside your empty core
Is looking for a fall

The seer doesn't do a thing
But sees that all is finished
Foolish people run about
And leave totality diminished

Goodness must be doing
And justice never is complete
Propriety can't satisfy
Obedience is forced defeat

When totality is lost
Goodness comes to take its place
Followed by propriety
Bewilderment and end of grace

The seer sees periphery
But also sees the open core
And thus the seer sees the whole
And dwells therein forevermore
