All things emerge from nullity
The only derivation
Of everything that manifests
The source of all creation

Stay in touch with origin
There's nothing that you need deny
Seeing your totality
You will not fear to die

Do not be in haste to speak
And always guard the senses
You will find your heart at peace
And in the place where all commences

See the subtle and the clear
It is the empty source of light
There is no danger in this place
That is forever in plain sight
