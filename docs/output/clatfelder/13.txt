Fame and shame are equal
And so are gain and loss
It isn't very difficult
To get this point across

Having fame you know that you
Are terrified to lose it
Making gain you always fear
That others will abuse it

Can you see that you're not like
Your image or reflection?
Just see you are totality
By looking in your own direction

The one who is not limited
Accepts whatever comes or goes
And cares for everything around
On opening and close
