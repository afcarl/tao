Know the strong but keep the weak
The whole wide world is born in you
You'll see just what a child sees
A vast and comprehensive view

Know the light but keep the dark
And watch ten thousand things emerge
In you they have their residence
Where space and time converge

Know the high but keep the low
Humility will honor you
Attend to your vacuity
There's nothing else to do

Be like an uncarved block of wood
Don't squander your potential
Or overlook your vacant core
Nothing else is so essential
