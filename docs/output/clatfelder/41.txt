When seers see their nothingness
They never let it out of sight
But others see it now and then
And miss out on its true delight

Still others only laugh it off
And look at it with ridicule
It wouldn't be the real truth
If it weren't laughed at by the fool

The brightest way seems darkness
Just going on seems like retreat
The simple way seems difficult
Capacity seems like defeat

Clarity can seem obscure
And love seem not to care
Totality seems not enough
And truth can seem to err

Awareness doesn't have a name
To all appearances is null
Yet it produces everything
And so this empty place is full
