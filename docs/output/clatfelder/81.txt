Truth need not be eloquent
And eloquence may not be true
There is no need to argue
When truth is shining through

Those who see may not be learned
The learned may not see
To see you merely need to look
In pure simplicity

The seer doesn't have to hoard
And does not fear to lose
The more you give, the more you have
So why should you refuse?

Why not give it all away?
For emptiness brings benefit
And as the seers always say
The more you give, the more you get
