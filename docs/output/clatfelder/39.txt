If you stay with clear awareness
The sky is open, pure and spacious
The earth is firm and friendly too
Activity is efficacious

But depart from clarity
The purest sky is torn apart
The earth is so divided
Felicity must flee your heart

The seer knows humility
Doesn't argue or cajole
Doesn't discard anything
Or mutilate the whole

The seer doesn't show at all
Doesn't sparkle like a jewel
The seer's vast immensity
Is truly less than minuscule
