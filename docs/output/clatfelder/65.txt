Those of old who found the way
Could see their inner core
They saw that it was hidden
And didn't bring it to the fore

When people think they know the truth
They want all others to concur
But they are happy and content
When they remain unsure

Don't try to lead with cleverness
Prefer instead simplicity
It's obvious that truth must lie
In nothingness and clarity
