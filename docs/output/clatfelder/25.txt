Before creation did occur
This blessed emptiness was here
Alone forever and at peace
The source of all that does appear

Eternally unchanging
Forever lacking limit
This void is all potential
The everlasting ultimate

It flows through all existence
And then returns to source
It's ever at your center
Your only true recourse

For here begins the universe
The earth and humankind
Following this greatest way
You can never be defined
