In conflict just be cautious
And always on your guard
Rather than advance an inch
Instead retreat a yard

In this way you go along
And make your gain without advancing
You deal with the rival
As your position is enhancing

Remember that it's possible
Your rival just may yield
So don't advance on such a foe
Let differences be healed
