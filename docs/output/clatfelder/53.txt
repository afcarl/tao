This way is wide and easy
Yet people love to stray
They love to take the sidetracks
And wander from the way

When the few are rich and wealthy
Living way above their needs
The granaries are empty
And the fields are full of weeds

When rulers spend on weapons
And implements of war
It's a never ending circle
Of ever wanting more

When the rich have all abundance
What remains must surely dwindle
Having more than you can use
Is thievery and fraud and swindle
