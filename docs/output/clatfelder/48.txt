In going after learning
Something's added every day
For resting in the ultimate
Everything must drop away

Day by day do less and less
Until nothingness is seen
All occurs quite on its own
A doer need not intervene

Allow all things to run their course
If you want to be proficient
Make a fuss and bother
And existence will be insufficient
