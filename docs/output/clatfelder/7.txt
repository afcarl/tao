This presence is unlimited
Because it wasn't ever born
And it will not be perishing
Will never give you cause to mourn

It truly wants for nothing
It has no wishes of its own
It is the one and only
Eternally alone

It holds itself in vacancy
With no desire to advance
Remaining in simplicity
It merely witnesses the dance

The seer will remain behind
And never yearns for leaving home
Just living in the here and now
Prefers to stay unknown
