Hold fast to this awareness
Seeing that it is your root
It will not ever slip away
This ever present absolute

It cannot be uprooted
It's always held in veneration
Discovered very close at hand
In every generation

Allow its presence in your life
Awareness real and profound
Allow it in the family
Its blessings will abound

And if you care to share it
With neighbor and with friend
Its potency will multiply
With benefits that never end

You ask me how I know it's true
It isn't something I mistook
Well nothing is more obvious
The only thing I do is look
