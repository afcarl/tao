Let your lead be gentle
And people will be satisfied
Let it be severe and harsh
And be rejected and defied

Happiness may reign today
But who knows what tomorrow holds?
Sadness too will have its time
As all ten thousand things unfold

The seer's sight is sharp and pointed
But it does not cut or pierce
The seer sees and shows the truth
This gentle way is never fierce
