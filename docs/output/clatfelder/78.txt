Water is so very soft
It overcomes because it yields
By wearing down the hardest rock
It shows what power weakness wields

The weak can overcome the strong
The soft can overcome the hard
Everybody knows it's true
So hold the low in high regard

The seer sees serenity
Where others see affliction
The seer sees the inner truth
Where others only see a fiction
