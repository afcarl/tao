The sea is large and mighty
Because it lies below
The streams and rivers of the world
Thus capturing their flow

If you want to have your fill
Then you must see that you are hollow
If you want to lead the way
Then you must be prepared to follow

When you lead you are above
But no one feels put down
And when you must be out in front
Know that no one's losing ground

When you see that you're not built
For facing up or confrontation
No one can contend with you
Who are the ultimate negation
