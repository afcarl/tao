I'm at the center and the source
Of all ten thousand things
Where I receive the benefits
That pure awareness brings

These benefits belong to all
To good and bad the same
For nature gives you what you need
With no regard for praise or blame

Words and deeds of excellence
May bring you honor and acclaim
But nature values each alike
And is indifferent to fame

When new leaders are installed
Don't send gifts or lofty praise
Stay centered in the unity
Provided by the inward gaze

Why should you esteem the void?
It does away with imperfection
Those who seek are bound to find
It disappears on close inspection
