To truly lead with fairness
You must put aside control
Abandon imposition
Make spontaneity your goal

The more you try to run their lives
With rules and prohibition
The poorer people's lives become
The more they live in opposition

The more you deal with others
With cunning and with guile
The more that other people say
Our lives are not worthwhile

The more you hoard your treasures
The more you're giving hope to thieves
The more you sharpen weapons
The more the country grieves

Do nothing and see all is done
And everyone is true
Drop the rules and people owe
Prosperity to you

Just let go of all desire
And people will return
To natural and simple ways
To life without concern
