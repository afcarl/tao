Nature's way of doing
Is like the bending of a bow
For pulling on a bow you see
The low go high and the high go low

Nature takes from those who have
And gives to those who lack
When nature takes from human beings
They fight to get it back

But if you see you have it all
You're not afraid to give away
Expecting nothing in return
It all comes back with no delay
