The seer flows like water
Lying low along the way
Nourishing whatever comes
To be held on display

The seer keeps to simple ways
And therefore is content
When joy or sorrow manifests
To give complete assent

If you can clearly be yourself
And never rise to interfere
Everyone will cherish you
And always hold you dear
