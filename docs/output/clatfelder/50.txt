Between the time when they are born
And the time that they will die
Three in ten will follow life
Three others only will deny

Three others are so casual
They live as though they're passing through
But one remains who clearly sees
There's not a single thing to do

Can you be like the one who sees
The world emerging on its own?
What's needed for each moment
Arises from the great unknown

This one doesn't have a fear
Of weaponry or wild beast
These enemies can't harm the one
Whose separate self is long deceased
