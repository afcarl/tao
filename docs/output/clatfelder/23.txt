Say your piece and then be still
Like nature in a storm
That rains and blows and ceases
And sees the sun reborn

Open to the inward view
You are at one with all existence
There's nothing blocking up the way
Or putting up resistance

If you're at home with nothingness
And simply trust what comes about
You'll find that all is in its place
Without a question or a doubt
