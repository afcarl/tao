Totality will be with you
If you can see the simple presence
Although there's danger all around
You give complete acceptance

Good music, food and company
Are welcome when you're traveling
The inner truth seems tasteless
Yet it produces everything

You look and you see nothing
You listen and hear silence
Its use is inexhaustible
It's ever worthy of reliance
