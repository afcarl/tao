There is an ancient way to lead
That just allows and does not force
For what goes out will come around
And violence will lead to wars

The one who sees completes a task
And stops when it is done
Seeing all is on its own
And not controlled by anyone

The seer sees that all is well
And does not need to please
Just gives acceptance everywhere
Puts everyone at ease
