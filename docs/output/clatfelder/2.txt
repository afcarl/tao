Where beautiful and ugly
Do not stand in opposition
Where life and death or yes and no
Do not make a contradiction

Can you see the vacant place
Where good and bad and sad and merry
Disappear forevermore?
Where nothing ever is contrary

So stay within the emptiness
Unless you rise you never fall
Accepting that which comes your way
You are forever all in all
