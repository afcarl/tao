Weapons lead to violence
Which everyone despises
Avoid them altogether
Allow no compromises

If use of weapons has to be
When enemies just leave no choice
Use them but reluctantly
In victory do not rejoice

Ascendancy brings sorrow
And triumph doesn't carry pleasure
It severs you from wholeness
And robs you of your real treasure

Victory is like a funeral
Where loss of life must make you sad
For putting other people down
Never ought to make you glad
