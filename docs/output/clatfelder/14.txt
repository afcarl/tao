When you look, it isn't there
Listen and you cannot hear it
It seems to be beyond your reach
Because you are so near it

This single source of everything
Appears to be an empty image
Though it cannot be understood
You can see its naked visage

Follow it to nothingness
Approach it where you have no face
From nowhere to infinity
This vacant image leaves no trace

From never to eternity
This naked face is what you are
An empty, vacant, open door
Forevermore ajar
