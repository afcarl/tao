The seer doesn't own a thought
For thoughts do not reside within
Thoughts concern ten thousand things
And that's the way it's always been

The seer doesn't rush to judge
And treats all people well
Considers no one bad or good
Attracts but never does repel

The seer trusts things as they are
And takes all people at their word
Giving trust to everyone
Knows faithfulness will be returned

The seer turns your view around
So you can never be beguiled
And gives you back all that you lost
The vision of a little child
