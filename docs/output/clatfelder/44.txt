Which of these means more to you
Integrity or reputation?
Are gain and loss not equally
Responsible for limitation?

Everything that you possess
Is surely transitory
Just be pleased with emptiness
And witness inner bliss and glory

You know that your are always safe
If only you can be contented
With awareness as capacity
And with all that is presented
