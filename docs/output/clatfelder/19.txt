Banish learned discourse
And everyone will be content
Eliminate propriety
Increase astonishment

Stay away from fraud and swindle
Everyone is bound to gain
You really have it all you know
There is no basis to complain

Can you see your empty core?
It isn't missing, gone or hidden
Just let go of neediness
And it will come unbidden
