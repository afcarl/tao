The naked center doesn't change
Its quietude is absolute
Yet from it spring all things that move
This bare awareness is the root

Can you go about all day
And never leave your true abode
No matter how enticing are
The splendors of the road?

Don't think that you can run around
And act a perfect fool
Just see that you are at the eye
Of nature's whirlpool
