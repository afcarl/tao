If a land is small and the people few
And the rulers recognize what's needed
The simple ways of courtesy
Are happily and gladly heeded

For people need so little
To live their lives aright
Are food and home and clothing
Not enough for pure delight?

Though nearby lands are close enough
To hear their roosters crow
The people will be so content
That not a one will want to go
