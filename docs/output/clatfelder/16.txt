See that you are emptiness
Always quiet and at peace
You're in the place where all begins
The space where all things cease

All things arise and have their day
And then go back to the single source
Returning to serenity
With no regret and no remorse

When you see the source within
You only give assent
You see you're everlasting
And eternally omnificent
