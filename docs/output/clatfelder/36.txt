You cannot be diminished
Unless you've been inflated
You cannot be defeated
Unless you've been elated

You cannot be belittled
Unless you've been esteemed
Unless you're wholly missing
You cannot be redeemed

The soft and slow can overcome
The rigid and the hard and fast
Just see your inner emptiness
For nothing else is made to last
