It's best to lead a large domain
As you would cook a little fish
Don't poke and prod or you are bound
To spoil the country and the dish

Just stay open and aware
And evil cannot get a hold
Cannot find a home in you
Even evil's not that bold

At center you harm no one
And no one's able to harm you
This kind of reciprocity
Creates the world anew
