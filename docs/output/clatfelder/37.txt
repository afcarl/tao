Only see you're doing nothing
Yet not a thing is left undone
For all things happen on their own
In you who are the all in one

If leaders could be centered
All ten thousand things would thrive
By seeing what is natural
All creation comes alive

Everyone would be content
With living simply every day
Desires would be moderate
And peace would be the only way
