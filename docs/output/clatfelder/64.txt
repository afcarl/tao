To keep the peace is easy
Begin before a problem stirs
Handle things before they happen
And trouble before it occurs

Be calm and conquer worries
Before they can proceed
The very largest tree begins
As just a tiny seed

It takes a single step to start
A journey of a thousand miles
And just one brick to start to build
The grandest domiciles

Let things happen as they will
You do not need to interfere
See that you do nothing
That causes discord to appear
