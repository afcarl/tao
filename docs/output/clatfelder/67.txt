On seeing inner nothingness
You see it's great beyond compare
Though many find it curious
That you would even care

I have three treasures that I keep
The first is friendliness
The second is to stay behind
The third is wanting less

For if you're friendly and you care
You can dare to do what's needed
And if you always stay behind
The lead will surely be conceded

And if you're satisfied with less
You have everything to give
Keep these treasures in your heart
Then you will truly live
