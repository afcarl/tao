Begin with the easy
And do without doing
There isn't a thing
That you should be pursuing

Begin with the simple
There's no need attacking
Your greatness will lie
In all that you're lacking

Tackle problems when they're small
And still subject to solution
The largest problem is resolved
By simple deeds of diminution

Can you center every day
And see all the seers see
Empty here and brimming there
A marvelous asymmetry?
