The empty center's everywhere
It flows both left and right
It brings to pass ten thousand things
And yet it never leaves your sight

It welcomes everything around
On nothing does it make a claim
It's in the heart of each and all
This ultimate without a name

Some can see that it is great
And some will say that it's obscure
It is your real identity
Simplicity that will endure
