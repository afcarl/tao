You need not give a yes or no
Such distinctions matter little
Keep your vision open
And be at center noncommittal

See that it's ridiculous
To seek success and fear to fail
To ever want what others want
To think you always must prevail

Other people look so bright
I am dark and void and null
Others are so very sharp
While I alone am dull

Others are so purposeful
Only I don't understand
Aimless, drifting, weak and dumb
Uninteresting and bland

I see I'm different from the rest
For I take in what's plainly shown
And I take my sustenance
Only from the great unknown
