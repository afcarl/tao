Awareness is not limited
It's like an uncarved block of wood
With infinite potential
Beyond all usefulness for good

If leaders could stay centered
In awareness pure and plain
This world would be as nourishing
As nature's gentle rain

Everyone would be at peace
And always living in the whole
Opposition and division
Could never take their toll
