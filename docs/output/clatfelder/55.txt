One who sees full emptiness
Is like a child just born
With muscles weak and bones so soft
Yet with a grip that's strong

The newborn hasn't been fulfilled
Its nature is pure vacancy
Nullity and nothingness
And potent spontaneity

It can scream and cry all day
And yet it never does get hoarse
It only does what naturally
Emerges from the inner source

To see this inner nature
Is seeing in a way that's bold
Into the only place there is
That cannot possibly grow old
