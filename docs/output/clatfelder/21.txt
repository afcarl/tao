Seeming utter emptiness
Quite impossible to trace
Yet it contains all images
Within its wide embrace

Appearing total darkness
Yet you see that it is right
To stay with its obscurity
The only origin of light

This ever present openness
At center and within
Can be seen just anytime
So look and look again
