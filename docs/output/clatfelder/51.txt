Everything arises
From this total emptiness
Is nourished and completed
And finds creation blessed

All things arise from nothingness
Are cared for by existence
Which freely gives what is required
For bountiful subsistence

Existence does not make a claim
On what it has created
It nourishes and serves and leads
Is honored and appreciated
