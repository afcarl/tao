Awareness comes from nothingness
So all can see it's plainly one
Contains all opposition
Ten thousand things are now begun

All these things embrace the void
And face the manifest
Achieving thus true harmony
They find existence truly blessed

No one wants to be considered
Empty and alone
Yet that's exactly what the seers
Say they have been shown

And violence is not the way
I give you this instruction
Those who live by violence
Will bring about their own destruction
