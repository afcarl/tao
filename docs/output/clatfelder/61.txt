A great domain is like the sea
Whose power comes from lying low
And due to this humility
Its greatness has to grow

A small domain can lie low too
Acknowledging its low location
Surrender and humility
Give rise to exaltation

If you lie low you too arise
To uppermost position
For everyone's attracted to
One who doesn't fear submission
