Overcome by giving up
See that you are really nil
Look into your emptiness
If you want to have your fill

Be satisfied with little
Just content with what you need
If you are always wanting more
You surely are consumed by greed

Abide in your simplicity
Though you are not on display
See all things are shining bright
In marvelous array

If you do not boast or brag
Everyone will hold you high
If you do not argue
You will prevail thereby

Only see you are complete
And all things have come to you
Overcome by giving up
All except your inner view
