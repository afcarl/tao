Those of old who knew the way
To origin and source within
Have seen the place where wholeness
And infinity begin

Alert as one on a frozen stream
Or one who watches for the foe
Deferential as a guest
And generous as melting snow

Plain as an uncarved block of wood
Expansive as a vale
Transparent just like water
Whose clarity will never fail

Can you keep yourself so still
That muddy water clears?
And wait until right action
Spontaneously appears?
