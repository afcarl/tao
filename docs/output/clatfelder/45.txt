Wholeness seems like imperfection
Yet its usefulness is sure
Fullness seems quite empty
But it is certain to endure

True straightness can seem twisted
True wisdom does not seem to know
Great eloquence seems halting
Great darkness seems to be aglow

Can you see that emptiness
Contains all oppositions?
Like hot and cold and fast and slow?
All differences and all conditions?
