Can you walk and leave no tracks?
Make no errors when you talk?
Count without a tally?
Secure a door without a lock?

You can abandon no one
There's nothing you can leave behind
In you there are no limits
You are forever unconfined

What happens is spontaneous
Good and bad are just the same
In origin identical
Beyond both praise and blame
