My words are very easily understood, and very easily put into practice.
Yet no one in the world is able to understand and to practice them.
My words have their root; my deeds have their lord.
Just because the people do not know, they do not know me.
Those who know me are few.
Those who emulate me are rare.
Therefore, the Sage wears coarse clothes on the outside,
And bears precious jade near his breast.
