To rule a large nation is as to cook a small fish.
In a world with Tao prevailing,
Ghosts will not become goblins.
Not that ghosts will not become goblins,
But God will not hurt the people;
Not that God will not hurt the people,
But the Sage will not hurt them either.
When both will not hurt each other,
All virtue will converge to them.
