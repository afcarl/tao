If the people do not fear death,
Why threaten them with death?
If we let the people always fear death,
And we capture and kill those who use trickery,
Who would dare [to use trickery]?
Those responsible for executions perform executions.
But those who perform executions for them
Are doing no more than carving wood for the greater carpenter.
And those who carve wood for the great carpenter
Can rarely fail to injure their own hands.
