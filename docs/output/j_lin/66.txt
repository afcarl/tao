Rivers and seas become the kings of one hundred valleys
Because they are able in putting themselves below;
So they can become their kings.
Therefore, for the sake of staying above the people,
The Sage must lower himself with words.
For the sake of staying ahead of the people,
He must put himself behind them.
Therefore, the Sage stays above and the people do not feel the burden.
He stays in front and the people do not consider him harmful.
Therefore the whole world delights in exalting him without tiring.
Because he does not compete,
The whole world cannot fight with him.
