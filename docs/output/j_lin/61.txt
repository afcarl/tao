A large state is like the low land;
It is the focus point of the world
And the female of the world.
The female always conquers the male by serenity.
In serenity, she puts herself low.
Therefore, the large state puts itself beneath the small state,
And thereby absorbs the small state.
The small state puts itself under the large state,
And thereby joins with the large state.
Therefore, one either puts himself beneath to absorb others,
Or puts himself under to join with others.
What the large state wants is no more than to feed the people.
What the small state wants is no more than to join and serve the people.
Both have their needs satisfied.
Thus the large ought to stay low.
