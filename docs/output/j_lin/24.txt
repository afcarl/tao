Those who rise on tiptoe cannot stand.
Those who stride cannot walk.
Those who hold to their views cannot be enlightened.
Those who are self-righteous cannot shine.
Those who boast cannot receive credit.
Those who are arrogant cannot last long.
In the light of Tao, they are like left-over food and burdensome wens,
Even despised by all creatures.
So those with Tao do not want to stay with them.
