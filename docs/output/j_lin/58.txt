When the government is sluggish and dull,
The people are honest and content;
When the government is discriminating and exacting,
The people are wily and restless.
Calamity is what good fortune depends on.
Good fortune is what calamity hides in.
Who knows their utmost?
Is it not better to have no rectitude?
Rectitude returns to trickery;
And goodness returns to evil.
The people's delusion has long existed.
Therefore, the Sage is square but not cutting;
is honest but does not hurt;
is straight but does not bully;
is bright but does not shine.
