Hold on to the great image
And the whole world will follow.
Following without harm, in safety, peace, and comfort.
Music and viand will cause the traveler to stop.
But Tao spoken by mouth is flavorless and bland.
Looked at, it cannot be seen.
Listened to, it cannot be heard.
Used, it will never be exhausted.
