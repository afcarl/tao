The world had a beginning
Which was the mother of the world.
Having known the mother, we know the son.
Having known the son, we keep the mother.
Thus, through life, we are without danger.
Block the passage;
Shut the door;
Throughout life there will be no toil.
Open the passage;
Multiply the activities;
Throughout life there will be no cure.
To discern the small is called enlightenment;
To preserve weakness is called strength.
Use the light;
Return to enlightenment;
Leave nothing to harm the body;
This is called practicing the constant.
