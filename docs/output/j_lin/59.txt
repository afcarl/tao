In governing the people and serving heaven,
There is nothing like thriftiness.
Only through thriftiness can one submit [to Tao] early;
Having submitted early, one accumulates virtue.
Having accumulated virtue, one can overcome everything.
Having overcome everything, one can know no limits.
Knowing no limits, one is able to rule a nation.
Possessing the mother of the nation, he may last long.
This is called the deep root and firm stalks,
And the way to longevity and everlasting vision.
