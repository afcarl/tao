He who wants to take the world and act on it will not be able to achieve, I know.
The world is a sacred vessel
Which cannot be acted on.
To act on it is to destroy it.
To seize it is to lose it.
So the things
Either lead or follow;
Either whistle or blow;
Either are strong or weak;
Either defeat or fall.
That is why the Sage abandons the excessive, the extravagant, and the extreme.
