Things at rest are easy to hold.
Things unbegun are easy to plan.
Fragile things are easy to shatter.
Tiny things are easy to scatter.
Manage things before they exist.
Set things in order before they become chaotic.
A tree as big as one's embrace originates from a rootlet.
A nine-story terrace begins with a heap of earth.
A thousand-li journey starts from beneath one's feet.
To act means to fail;
To insist means to lose.
The Sage does not act and therefore never fails;
He does not insist and therefore never loses.
When the people undertake to do something,
They almost always fail at the point of success.
One should be cautious at the end as at the beginning,
Then there will be no failure.
Therefore the Sage desires no desires,
Values not the rare treasures,
Learns from the unlearned,
Reverses the faults of the people,
And assists all things in their natural development,
Never daring to interfere.
