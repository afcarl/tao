If only I could have a little knowledge, I would walk in the Great Tao,
Being afraid only of acting on it.
The Great Tao is very smooth,
But people prefer the by-paths;
The court is very well kept;
The fields are full of weeds;
And the granaries are extremely empty.
To wear embroidered clothes,
To carry sharp weapons,
To be satiated in food and drink,
And to have excessive treasures and goods -
This is called robbery and extravagance.
Really, this is not Tao.
