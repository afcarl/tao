A good walker leaves no trail.
A good speaker leaves no grounds for blame.
A good counter needs no calculator.
A well-closed door needs no bolt
and still cannot be opened.
A well-tied knot needs no binding
and still cannot be untied.
Therefore the Sage is always able to save his people
and there is no one forsaken.
He is able to save all things
and there is nothing wasted.
This is called inherited enlightenment.
Therefore the good man is the teacher of the bad.
And the bad man is the material for the good.
He who fails to value the teacher and cherish the material,
Is utterly lost in spite of his knowledge.
This is called crucial subtlety.
