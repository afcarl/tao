The man of supreme goodness resembles water.
Water benefits all things
Without competing with them,
Staying in places that men despise;
Therefore, it is very close to Tao.
Dwelling in good places,
Having a heart that loves the profound,
Allying with benevolence,
Inviting trust with words,
Being righteous in governing,
Managing all things well,
Moving at the right time.
Just because he does not compete,
The man of supreme goodness frees himself of blame.
