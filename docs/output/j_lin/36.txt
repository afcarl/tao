About to shut it, let it first be opened.
About to weaken it, let it first be strengthened.
About to destroy it, let it first be advanced.
About to snatch it, let it first be given away.
This is called the subtle wisdom.
The soft overcomes the hard;
The weak overcomes the strong.
As fish cannot be separated from deep water,
The state's sharp weapons cannot be shown to the people.
