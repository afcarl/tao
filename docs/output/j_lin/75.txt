The people are starving
Because the man on top devours too much tax money.
So they are starving.
The people are hard to govern
Because the man on top is too active in governing.
So they are hard to govern.
The people think little of death
Because the man on top strives for a rich life.
So they think little of death.
Therefore it is better to do nothing for one's life
Than to value it.
