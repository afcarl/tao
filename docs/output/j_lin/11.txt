Thirty spokes converge in a nave;
just because of its nothingness [void] the usefulness of the cart exists.
Molded clay forms a vessel;
just because of its nothingness [hollowness] the usefulness of the utensil exists.
Doors and windows are cut into a house;
just because of their nothingness [emptiness] the usefulness of the house exists.
Therefore, profit from that which exists and utilize that which is absent.
