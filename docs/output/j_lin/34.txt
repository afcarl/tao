The great Tao overflows,
able to move left and right.
All things rely on it for life,
But it does not dominate them.
Completing its task without possession,
Clothing and feeding all things,
Without wanting to be their master.
Always void of desire,
It can be called Small.
All things return to it
Without its being their master;
It can be called Great.
Just because the Sage would never regard himself as great,
He is able to attain his own greatness.
