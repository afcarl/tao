One who makes a good general is not warlike;
One who makes a good fighter is not angry;
One who makes a great conqueror of his enemies does not strive;
One who knows how to manage the people well places himself under them.
This is called the virtue of not competing.
This is called the power of using people.
This is called the match of Heaven, the ultimate of the Ancients.
