The Sage has no constant heart [mind].
He takes the people's heart as his heart.
Good men, I treat well.
Bad men, I also treat well.
Therein I attain goodness.
Honest men, I trust.
Dishonest men, I also trust.
Therein I attain trust.
The Sage in his position in the world,
Yieldingly harmonizes the people's heart with simplicity.
The people all strain their ears and eyes.
And the Sage regards them all as infants.
