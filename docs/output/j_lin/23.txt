To spare words is to be natural.
Therefore a whirlwind does not last all morning,
And a sudden shower does not last all day.
Who causes this?
Heaven and earth.
If even Heaven and earth cannot last long,
What can man do?
Therefore one dealing with Tao will resemble Tao.
Dealing with virtue, one will resemble virtue.
Dealing with loss, one will resemble loss.
If one resembles Tao, Tao is pleased to accept him.
If one resembles virtue, virtue is pleased to accept him.
If one resembles loss, loss is also pleased to accept him.
By not having enough credibility,
One will not be trusted [by others].
