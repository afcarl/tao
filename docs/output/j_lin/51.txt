Tao begets them.
Virtue nurtures them.
Matter gives them form.
Circumstances bring them into completion.
Therefore all things not only respect Tao but also value virtue.
Yet Tao is respected and virtue is valued.
Without being ordered, they come naturally.
Therefore Tao begets them.
Virtue nurtures them, grows them and rears them, perfects them and ripens them, nourishes them and shelters them.
Begetting without possessing;
Acting without asserting;
Developing without controlling;
This is called mystical virtue.
