Perhaps the Tao of heaven resembles the drawing of a bow.
When it is high, lower it.
When low, raise it.
When excessive, diminish it.
When deficient, replenish it.
The Tao of heaven diminishes the excessive and replenishes the deficient.
The Tao of man is not so - while decreasing the deficient, it supplies the excessive.
Who can supply the world with overabundance?
Only the man with Tao.
Therefore the Sage acts without exalting his ability.
He achieves without dwelling upon it.
He does not want to display his superiority.
