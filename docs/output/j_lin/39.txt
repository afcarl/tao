Those of ancient times obtained the One:
Heaven obtained the One for its clarity;
Earth obtained the One for its tranquility;
The Spirit obtained the One for its divinity;
The Valley obtained the One for its repletion;
All things obtained the One for their lives;
Dukes and kings obtained the One for the rectitude of the world.
What causes these is the One.
Without clarity, Heaven could not avoid disrupting.
Without tranquility, Earth could not avoid explosion.
Without divinity, The Spirit could not avoid dissolving.
Without repletion, The Valley could not avoid dissipating.
Without life, All things could not avoid perishing.
Without rectitude and dignity, Dukes and kings could not avoid falling.
Therefore, distinction has humility as its root;
The high regards the low as its foundation.
Therefore dukes and kings call themselves
Orphans, widowers, and starvers.
Does this not mean regarding humility as a base?
Doesn't it?
He who is most praise-worthy
Does not need any praise.
He prefers to be neither rare as jade,
Nor as common as rocks.
