Knowing the male and keeping the female,
One will become the river of the world.
Being the river of the world,
One will not digress from constant virtue,
And will return to being a baby.
Knowing the white and keeping the black,
One will become a model of the world.
Being a model of the world,
One will not deviate from constant virtue,
And will return to the infinite.
Knowing honor and keeping disgrace,
One will become the valley of the world.
Being the valley of the world,
One will be content with constant virtue,
And return to the unhewn wood.
Unhewn wood when scattered will become vessels.
The Sage makes use of them to become the chief officer.
Therefore the great system will not be cut apart.
