Great completion appears to be imperfect,
Yet its usefulness is never exhausted.
Great fullness appears to be empty,
Yet its usefulness is unlimited.
Great straightness seems bent.
Great craftiness seems clumsy.
Great eloquence seems to be stuttering.
Hastiness overcomes the cold.
Serenity overcomes the hot.
Calmness and serenity become the rectitude of the world.
