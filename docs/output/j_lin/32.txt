Tao is constantly nameless.
Though the unhewn wood is small,
No one in the world dares to subjugate it.
If dukes and kings can keep it,
All things will become guests by themselves.
Heaven and earth conjugate in dropping sweet dew;
People without being ordered are fair to each other.
In the beginning of creation, all were given names.
Having names, they know their limits.
Knowing their limits keeps them from danger.
Thus Tao is to the world
As brooks and valleys are to rivers and seas.
