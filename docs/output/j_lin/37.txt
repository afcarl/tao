Tao is always inactive.
But it leaves nothing undone.
If dukes and kings can keep it,
Then all things will be naturally transformed.
If transformation raises desires,
I would suppress them with nameless simplicity.
Nameless simplicity means being without desires.
Being without desires and with tranquility,
The world will keep peace by itself.
