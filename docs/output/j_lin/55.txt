Maintaining an abundance of virtue is comparable to being an infant.
Poisonous insects will not sting;
Ferocious beasts will not seize;
Predatory birds will not pounce;
The bones are tender, the sinews are soft, but the grasp is firm.
Not knowing the union of male and female,
The organ is fully formed;
This is the zenith of essence.
Howling and screaming all day without getting hoarse;
This is the zenith of harmony.
To know harmony means to be constant;
To know constancy means enlightenment;
To benefit one's own life is ill-fated.
To let one's heart direct vigor is to become stark.
Things in their prime will become old;
This is not Tao.
Being not Tao means to die early.
