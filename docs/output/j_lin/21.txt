The feature of great virtue is to follow only Tao.
Tao is something elusive and vague!
Though vague and elusive, in it is the image.
Though elusive and vague, in it is the substance.
Obscure and dim, in it is the spirit.
The spirit is truly genuine; in it is credibility.
From ancient times until now,
Its name has never disappeared.
By this the beginning of all things is known.
How can I know the beginning of all things?
By this.
