The state may be small; its people may be few.
Let the people have tenfold and one-hundredfold of utensils,
But never make use of them.
Let the people weigh death heavily
And have no desires to move far away.
Though there be boats and carriages,
No one will ride in them.
Though there be armour and weapons,
No one will exhibit them.
Let the people return to tying knots and using them.
Relish their food,
Appreciate their clothes,
Secure in their homes,
Happy with their customs.
The neighboring states will be so close that they can see each other, and hear the sounds of roosters and dogs.
But the people will grow old and die,
Without having visited each other.
