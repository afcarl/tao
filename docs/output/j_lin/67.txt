The whole world says that
My Tao is great but seems to resemble nothing.
Because it is great, it seems to resemble nothing.
If resembling anything, it would have become small long ago.
I have three treasures
To be kept and treasured;
One is compassion.
The second is thriftiness.
The third is not daring to be ahead of the world.
Through compassion, one can be brave.
Through thriftiness, one can be expansive.
Not daring to be ahead of the world,
One can be the master of the vessels.
Now to abandon compassion and to be brave,
To abandon thriftiness and to be expansive,
To abandon the rear and to be in front -
That means death!
Compassion, in attack, will bring victory;
In defense, it will hold firmly.
When heaven is going to save a person,
It will protect him with compassion.
