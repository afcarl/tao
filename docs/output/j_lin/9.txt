Hold [a cup] and fill it to the brim;
Is it not better to stop in time?
Hammer and sharpen [an edge];
It cannot last long.
Fill a hall with gold and jade;
They cannot be protected.
He who is rich, honored, and arrogant brings blame upon himself.
He who withdraws after achieving success and performing duty adheres to the Tao of heaven.
