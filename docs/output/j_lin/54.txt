To be built well is not to be toppled.
To be held fast is not to slip.
With this, children and grandchildren will never stop offering sacrifice to their ancestors.
With this to cultivate oneself, one's virtue will be true;
With this to cultivate the family, its virtue will be plentiful;
With this to cultivate the community, its virtue will last long;
With this to cultivate the nation, its virtue will be abundant;
With this to cultivate the world, its virtue will be good.
Therefore,
Examine a person with a person,
Examine a family with a family,
Examine a community with a community,
Examine a nation with a nation,
Examine a world with a world.
How can I know this is the way of the world?
By this.
