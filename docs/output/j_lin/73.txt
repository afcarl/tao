To be brave in daring is to be killed.
To be brave in not daring is to live.
Both of them are either beneficial or harmful.
Who knows the real reason for heaven's hatred?
Even the Sage would find it difficult.
The Tao of heaven does not compete, but is good in winning;
does not speak, but is good in responding;
does not summon, but things come by themselves;
behaves calmly, but is good in planning.
The net of heaven is so vast.
Although it is wide open, it loses nothing.
