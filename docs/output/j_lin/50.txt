Coming out means life; going in means death.
Three-tenths of men are disciples of life.
Three-tenths of men are disciples of death.
Three-tenths of men actually have life, but strive for death through activity.
Why is this so?
Because they over-nourish themselves.
So I have heard that he who is capable of sustaining life
Can travel on land without ever encountering a rhinoceros or tiger;
Can enter a battle without ever being touched by arms and weapons.
The rhinoceros cannot charge him with its horns.
The tiger cannot attack him with its claws.
Weapons have no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this so?
Because he has no grounds for death.
