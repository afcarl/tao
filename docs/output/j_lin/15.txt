The Ancients who made themselves the best
Were subtle and penetrating
And deep beyond knowing.
Because they were beyond knowing,
we can only try to describe them:
Cautious, as if crossing the river in winter.
Circumspect, as if afraid of the neighbors on four sides.
Dignified, as if a guest.
Expansive, as melting ice.
Unspoiled, as unhewn wood.
Broad, as a valley.
Opaque, as turbid puddles.
Who can calm the turbid and clear it gradually?
Who can stir the inert and bring it gradually to life?
One who keeps this Tao does not wish to be filled.
And because he is not filled,
he can be sheltered and beyond renewal.
