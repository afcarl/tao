Heaviness is the foundation of lightness.
Serenity is the lord of rashness.
Therefore the Sage who travels the whole day never leaves his heavily covered carts.
Though there are spectacles of splendor, he stays composed and aloof.
Why as a ruler of ten thousand chariots would he treat himself lightly in the world?
Lightness will lose the foundation.
Rashness will lose the lord.
