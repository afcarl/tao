Attain the ultimate emptiness;
Maintain the absolute tranquility.
All things rise together.
And I observe their return ...
The multitude of all things return each to their origin.
To return to the origin means repose;
It means return to their destiny.
To return to their destiny means eternity;
To know eternity means enlightenment.
Not knowing eternity is to do evil things blindly.
To know eternity means having capacity.
Capacity leads to justice.
Justice leads to kingship.
Kingship leads to Heaven.
Heaven leads to Tao.
Tao is everlasting.
Thus the entire life will be without danger.
