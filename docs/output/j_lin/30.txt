Those who aid the ruler with Tao do not use military force to conquer the world.
Because this will invite retaliation.
Where the army stays, briers and thorns grow.
After a great war comes the year of adversity.
The good man stops after getting results.
Without daring to conquer.
He achieves results without bragging,
Achieves results without exalting,
Achieves results without arrogance,
Achieves results with reluctance,
Achieves results without conquering.
A thing in its prime soon becomes old;
This is not Tao.
Not being Tao, it is sure to die early.
