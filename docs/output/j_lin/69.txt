The commander of war has said:
"I dare not be a host, but be a guest.
I dare not advance one inch, but withdraw a foot."
This means:
To set up a march as if without one.
To stretch the arm as if without one.
To confront the enemy as if without one.
To grasp war weapons as if without them.
No calamity is greater than taking the enemy lightly.
Taking the enemy lightly almost makes me lose my treasures.
Therefore, in raising arms against each other,
The one with pity will win.
