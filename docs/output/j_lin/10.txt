Keeping one's ying poh and embracing the One,
Can man not depart from it?
Breathing intensely to induce softness,
Can man be like an infant?
The mystic vision being pure and clean,
Can it be without flaw?
Loving the people and governing the state,
Can man be without action?
Opening and closing the gate of heaven,
Can it not be the female?
Discerning and understanding the four corners,
Can man do so without knowledge?
To produce and to raise;
To produce without possessing;
To act without asserting;
To develop without controlling;
This is called the profound virtue.
