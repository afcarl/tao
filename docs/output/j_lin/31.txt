Fine weapons are the tools of evil;
All things are likely to hate them.
So those with Tao do not want to deal with them.
The gentleman who stays at home values the left;
In war, he values the right.
Weapons are the tools of evil,
not the tools of the gentleman.
When he uses them unavoidably, he is most calm and detached
And does not glorify his victory.
To glorify means to relish the murder of people,
Relishing the murder of people,
One cannot exercise his will in the world.
Happy occasions prefer the left.
Sorrowful occasions prefer the right.
The lieutenant-general is placed on the left.
The general-in-chief is placed on the right.
This means observing this occasion with funeral rites.
Having killed many people, one should lament with sorrow and grief.
Victory in war must be observed with funeral rites.
