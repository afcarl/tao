Acting by inaction;
Doing by not doing;
Tasting by not tasting.
Whether it is great or small, whether it is much or little,
Always repaying malice with virtue.
Planning difficulties from the easier.
Employing the great from the small.
The world's difficult things surely begin with the easy.
The world's great things surely begin with the small.
Therefore, the Sage never does anything to be great
And so accomplishes greatness.
To take one's promises lightly results in little confidence.
To take things too easily results in much difficulty.
Therefore, even the Sage takes things seriously.
And never has any difficulty.
