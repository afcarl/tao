Nothing in the world is softer and weaker than water.
Yet, in attacking the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it.
Because nothing can exchange places with it,
Use weakness to overcome strength,
Use softness to overcome hardness.
None in the world do not know this.
But none can practice it.
Therefore the Sage says:
To suffer dishonor for the state
is to be the lord of the community;
To bear the calamity of the state
is to be the king of the world.
True words seem paradoxical.
