The settlement of great grudge always leaves some residue grudge!
How can this be remedied?
Therefore, the Sage retains the left stub of the contract,
And does not make claims on others.
The man with virtue keeps the contract,
While the man without virtue collects the tax.
The Tao of heaven plays no favoritism;
It is always for the good man.
