Of fame and life, which is more dear?
Of life and wealth, which is more worthy?
Of gain and loss, which is more distressing?
Therefore, loving in excess incurs great cost.
Overhoarding brings heavy loss.
To know what is enough means to avoid disgrace.
To know where to stop is to avoid danger.
Thus one can last long and endure.
