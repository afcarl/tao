Tao is the refuge of all things:
The treasure of the good man and the shield of the bad man.
Beautiful words can be for sale.
Good deeds can become gifts to others.
If a man is bad, can he be forsaken?
Therefore when the king is crowned and the three dukes are installed,
Though large, priceless jade preceding a team of four horses can be offered,
It is not as good as sitting down and offering this Tao.
Why did the ancients treasure this Tao?
Wasn't it said:
"With this Tao, the seeker will obtain, and the guilty will be spared"?
Therefore it is valued by the world!
