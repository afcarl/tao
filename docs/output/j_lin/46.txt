In a world with Tao,
racing horses are drawn back [to the fields] for dung.
In a world without Tao,
war horses are raised outside the city.
No crime is greater than having desires.
No calamity is greater than not knowing contentment.
No fault is greater than longing for gain.
Therefore, the contentment of knowing contentment is always contentment.
