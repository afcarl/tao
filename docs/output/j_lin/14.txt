Looked at, it cannot be seen;
it is called colorless.
Listened to, it cannot be heard;
it is called soundless.
Grasped, it cannot be obtained;
it is called formless.
These three cannot be investigated further,
so they merge together to make one.
The upper part is not bright;
The lower part is not dark.
So subtle, it cannot be named,
But returns to nothingness.
This is called the shape without shape,
the image without image.
This is called indistinct:
confronting it, one cannot see the head;
following it, one cannot see the back.
Grasp the Ancient Tao to manage present existence.
Thus we may know the beginning of the Ancient.
This is called the record of Tao.
