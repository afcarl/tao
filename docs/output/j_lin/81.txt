Sincere words are not kind;
Kind words are not sincere.
One who is good will never argue;
One who argues is not good.
One who knows does not know all;
One who knows all does not know at all.
The Sage does not store things for himself.
The more one does for others,
The more he has for himself.
The more one gives to others,
The more he keeps for himself.
The Tao of heaven is to benefit others without hurting them.
The Tao of the Sage is to act without competing.
