Of the best, the people barely know of his existence.
Of the next best, the people love and praise him.
Of the next one, the people are afraid of him.
And of the next, the people despise him.
He who does not trust others enough will not be trusted by them.
Therefore, hesitating, one should carefully choose his words.
When he accomplishes his task and the things get done,
The people all say: "We have done it by ourselves."
