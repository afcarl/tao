Do not glorify the skilled
And people won't wrangle.
Do not treasure rarities
And people won't steal.
Don't flaunt objects of desire
And people's hearts will not be disturbed.

When the sage rules,
He keeps people's minds blank and their stomachs full.
He weakens their ambitions but strengthens their bones.
He keeps people free from knowledge and desires
So the ones who do have knowledge are afraid to act.
If he acts without taking action
There is nothing that is not right.
