Keeping your heart and your spirit together
Can you maintain their unity?
Controlling your breath and making it soft
Can you become like a newborn child?
Washing and cleansing your inner vision
Can you make it perfectly clear?
Tending the people and ruling the state
Can you refrain from interfering?
As the gates of destiny open and close
Can you play the role of the woman?
A your mind probes and explores the whole universe
Can you remain ignorant?

To give life and to nourish,
To make yet not possess,
To toil yet expect no praise,
To guide yet not dominate:
This is called the secret virtue.
