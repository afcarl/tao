Empty yourself to the utmost.
Remain perfectly calm.
The myriad things arise together
I watch their return.
They flourish, then each goes back to its root.

To go back to the root is to find tranquility.
To find tranquility is to come back to life.
Coming back to life is what is constant.
To know what is constant is to be enlightened.
Not to know what is constant is to court disaster.
When you know what is constant you embrace everything.
When you embrace everything you are just.
When you are just you are kingly.
When you are kingly you follow nature.
Following nature you follow Tao.
Following Tao you last through all time.
Till the end of life, you will suffer no harm.
