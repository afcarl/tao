Look! It cannot be seen;
It's called the obscure.
Listen! It cannot be heard;
It's called the soundless.
Feel it! It cannot be grasped:
It's called the bodiless.
These three defy scrutiny.
Intermingled, they blend into one.

Above it is not bright.
Below it is not dark.
Continuous,
Unceasing,
Unnamable,
Reverting to nothingness.

It's an occurrence of no occurrence.
It is a form that takes no form.
Elusive like a shadow.
Intangible like haze.
Confront it! It has no face.
Follow it! It has no back.

If you grasp the ancient Tao
You can rule the realm of today.
If you know the ancient beginnings
You know the essence of Tao.
