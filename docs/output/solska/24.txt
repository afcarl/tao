Those who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm.
Those who walk in long strides do not walk well.
Those who flaunt themselves do not shine bright.
Those who insist on being right are not renowned.
Those who brag do not succeed.
Those who boast do not last long.
To the follower of Tao they're loathsome.
They're like leftover food or pointless pursuits.
The person of Tao turns away from them.
