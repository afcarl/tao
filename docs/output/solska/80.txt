If a country is small its people are few.
Having tools in abundance, they're unwilling to use them.
Mindful of death, they do not venture far.
Having wagons and boats, they do not ride in them.
Having weapons and shields, they keep them out of sight.
To keep records they've returned to using knotted cords.

They relish their food,
Delight in their clothes,
Find peace in their homes,
And joy in their plain way of life.
Though the neighboring country is within sight,
And its roosters and dogs can be heard,
People live, grow old and die
Without ever leaving to visit their neighbors.
