Those who are good at walking
Leave no tracks in the ground.
Those who are good at speaking
Speak without flaws.
Those who are good at counting
Require no tally.
Those who are good at shutting
Use no locks
Yet whatever they close
Cannot be opened.
Those who are good at tying
Use no ropes
Yet whatever they tie
Cannot be untied.

Thus the sage is always good at taking care of people
And abandons no one.
He's always good at looking after things
And abandons nothing.

This is called
Following what's bright.

The good are the teachers of those who are not good.
Those who are not good are the raw material for the good.
Those who do not respect their teachers
And don't care for their resources
However clever they may be, they're utterly confused.

This is called the essence of mystery.
