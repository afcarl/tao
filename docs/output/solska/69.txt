Experts in warfare have a saying:
"I dare not launch an attack.
I'd rather mount a defense.
I dare not advance a foot,
I'd rather retreat a mile."

This is called:
Moving forward without moving forward.
Removing the sleeves without baring the arms.
Being armed without holding a weapon.
Seizing the enemy without confronting him.

There is no worse disaster than to have no enemy.
If I have no enemy my treasure is as good as lost.
Thus when the battle begins
And the opponents are evenly matched
It is the grieving side that wins.
