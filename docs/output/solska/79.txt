When great enemies settle their quarrel
Some of their enmity will linger on.
Is there a way to set things right?
The sage abides by the agreement
And does not seek to assign blame.
People of virtue meet their obligations.
Those without virtue exact their claims.

The Tao of heaven does not take sides.
Yet it always stays with the good.
