Give up studying and you will have no distress.

Is there a difference between "yes" and "no"?
The good and the evil - are they alike?
Ought I to fear what others fear?
Confusion reigns; it is without end.

All around, people make merry
As if holding a festival in spring,
As if about to gorge at a feast.
I alone remain still and reveal nothing
Like an infant yet unable to smile.
I am forlorn, with no place to go.
Others possess enough to spare,
I alone seem to have nothing.
I seem like a fool; I'm utterly confused.
Other people are bright; so bright.
I alone am dark; so dark.
Other people are smart; so smart,
I alone am dull; so dull.
Ever drifting like the restless ocean,
Blown about like the ceaseless storm.
Other people pursue their goals,
I alone seem foolish and aimless.
Only I am a stranger; I'm unlike the others.
I take nourishment only from the mother.
