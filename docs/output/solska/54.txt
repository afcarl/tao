What is firmly set up cannot be unsettled.
What is firmly embraced cannot slip away.
The ancestor worship continues without cease.

Practice virtue in your self
And your virtue will become genuine.
Practice virtue in your family
And your virtue will overflow.
Practice virtue in your district
And your virtue will last long.
Practice virtue in your country
And your virtue will abound.
Practice virtue throughout the world
And your virtue will spread wide.

So use the individual to judge the individual.
Use the family to judge the family.
Use the district to judge the district.
Use the state to judge the state.
Use the world to judge the world.

How do I know the way of the world?
I do because of what's within me.
