The sage does not have fixed ideas.
He lets the thoughts of the others become his own.
He is good to those who are good
And to those who are not good.
Virtue is good.
He is faithful to those who are faithful
And to those who are not faithful.
Virtue is faithful.
The sage lives united with the world
And he allows his thoughts to embrace all.
The people fix on him their eyes and ears:
He seems to behave like a little child.
