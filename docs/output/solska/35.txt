Embrace the great idea
And the whole world will come to you.
It'll come to you and suffer no harm.
It'll find no peril but contentment and peace.
Travelers stop for food and for music
Yet it is said of Tao
That it is tasteless and bland.
When you look at it, there's not enough of it to see.
When you listen to it, there's not enough of it to hear.
Yet, when you use it, you can't use it up.
