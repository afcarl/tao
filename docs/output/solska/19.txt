Give up being great, forget being clever
And people will benefit enormously.
Give up being kind, forget being just
And love will return to the family.
Give up being sly, forget being greedy
And there'll be no more thefts or robberies.

Yet as a lesson
These three are incomplete.
The essential part to be added is this:
Become plain and simple
Like uncut wood.
Restrain your ambitions,
Restrict your desires.
