Greatest perfection seems to be flawed
Yet its usefulness is never impaired.
Greatest abundance seems to be void
Yet its usefulness never wears out.

Greatest honesty seems to be dishonest.
Greatest ingenuity seems to be inept.
Greatest eloquence seems like stammering.

Being in motion overcomes the cold.
Keeping calm overcomes the heat.
Those who remain calm and pure
Can set the world right.
