Those who wish to conquer the world and act upon it
Do not achieve their goals - this is what I have found.
The world is a perfect vessel.
It cannot be acted upon.
Those who act on it destroy it.
Those who grab at it lose it.

Because with things:
Some lead and some follow,
Some blow hot and some blow cold,
Some grow in strength and some weaken,
Some expand and some collapse.

That is why the sage rejects the excessive,
Rejects the elaborate,
And rejects the superfluous.
