Nature is sparing of words:
High winds do not last all morning.
A cloudburst does not last all day.
What makes them happen?
Heaven and earth.
If heaven and earth cannot sustain their works
How can people sustain theirs?

Therefore if you follow Tao you become like Tao.
If you follow virtue you become like virtue.
If you forsake Tao you become forsaken.

Those who are like Tao
Are gladly welcomed by Tao.
Those who are like virtue
Are gladly welcomed by virtue.
Those who are forsaken
Are gladly welcomed by forsakenness.

Those who don't trust receive no trust.
