Highest virtue does not follow virtue;
That is why it has virtue.
Lowest virtue does not stray from virtue;
That is why it lacks virtue.

Highest virtue takes no action
Yet it lacks reasons for doing so.
Lowest virtue takes action
Yet it has reasons for doing so.
Highest compassion takes action
Yet it lacks reasons for doing so.
Highest justice takes action
Yet it has reasons for doing so.
Highest ritual takes action
Yet if someone does not respond
It shows its fist to them and makes them comply.

When Tao is renounced there is virtue.
When virtue is renounced there is compassion.
When compassion is renounced there is justice.
When justice is renounced there is ritual.

Ritual is but a shadow of sincerity.
It's the beginning of confusion.
Foreknowledge is but a husk of Tao.
It's the beginning of ignorance.

Therefore those who are great
Dwell in the solid core and not in the shadow.
They dwell in the fruit, not in the husk.
It is the fruit they choose, the husk they spurn.
