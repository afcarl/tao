The whole world says:
"What you teach is great yet unlike anything else."
It is its greatness that makes it unlike anything else.
Were it like everything else
It would have become trivial a long time ago.

I have three treasures which I hold and keep safe.
The first is compassion.
The second economy.
The third not daring to take the lead.
If you're compassionate you can be fearless.
If you're not wasteful you can be giving.
If you're afraid to lead you can attain the highest honors.

Today people renounce compassion and try to be brave.
They are wasteful in extreme and try to be giving.
They refuse to be follow and they try to take the lead.
They are certainly doomed.

Compassion gives you victory in battle
And strength in defense.
When heaven comes to your rescue
With its compassion it keeps you safe.
