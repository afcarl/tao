The followers of knowledge gain something each day.
The followers of Tao lose something each day.
They lose and keep losing till they start doing nothing.
Yet though nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

If you would conquer the world, refrain from meddling.
If you meddle you cannot conquer the world.
