The one whose courage comes from being fearless
Gets killed.
The one whose courage comes from being fearful
Stays alive.
Both kinds of bravery lead to benefit or harm.
If one of them heaven detests who knows the reason why?
Even the sage is unable to explain this.

The Tao of heaven excels at overcoming without competing,
At responding without speaking,
At drawing to itself without beckoning,
At laying plans without hurrying.

Heaven's weapons are crude, its targets strewn wide
Yet when it takes aim it won't miss the mark.
