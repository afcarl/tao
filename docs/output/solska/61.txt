A big country is like a low-lying land.
It's like the meeting ground of the world.
It's like the female of the world.
The female always defeats the male with calmness.
Because she is calm, she remains low.

Thus if the big country is below the small country
It conquers the small country.
And if the small country is below the big country
It conquers the big country.
Thus some win by becoming low
And some win by remaining low.

What the big country wants
Is to unite people and nourish them.
What the small country wants
Is to serve people and find shelter for them.
Both can get what they want
If it's the big country that becomes low.
