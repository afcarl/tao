Why are the people starving?
Because those above them put heavy taxes on them
And eat up their grain.
That's why the people are starving.

Why are the people difficult to rule?
Because those above them are meddlesome.
That's why the people are difficult to rule.

Why are the people are unconcerned about death?
Because those above them care too much about life.
That's why the people are unconcerned about death.

It is better to disregard life
Than to exalt it too much.
