Tao gave birth to the One.
One gave birth to the Two.
Two gave birth to the Three.
The Three gave birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things have their backs in shadows
Their faces bask in the light.
Through the blending of life forces they achieve harmony.
"orphaned," "lonely" and "worthless"
Are conditions which people detest
Yet the nobles describe themselves with those names.

Thus sometimes by losing we gain.
And sometimes by gaining we lose.

What others teach I also teach:
"The violent have earned their death."
This is the source of my teaching.
