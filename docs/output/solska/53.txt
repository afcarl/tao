If my knowledge were really minute
While following great Tao,
I' only fear that I might drift from it.

Tao is easy to follow.
Yet people prefer to stray from it.
They keep the halls of authority in splendor,
But the fields remain untilled
And the granaries stand empty.
Clad in fineries, they carry sharp swords.
They eat too much and possess to excess.
What they do is thievery.
Thievery is not Tao.
