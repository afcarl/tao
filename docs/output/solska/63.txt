Act without taking action.
Be busy without busy-ness.
Taste what cannot be tasted.
Magnify the small
Multiply the few.
Repay injury with kindness.
Prepare for the difficult while it is still easy.
Work on the big thing while it is still small.

The difficult things of the world are initially easy.
The big things of the world are initially small.
The sage does not strive to achieve great things
So he is able achieve greatness.

Those who are quick to make promises
Are bound not to be trusted.
What may seem easy
Is bound to become hard.
The sage accepts his tasks as difficult.
Therefore they all become easy for him.
