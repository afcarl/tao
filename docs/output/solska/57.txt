To govern the state resort to what's regular.
To win a war resort to what's unusual.
But to conquer the world refrain from meddling.
How do I know of these methods?
I do because of what's within me.

The fewer the people's freedoms
the poorer the people become.
The more sharp weapons the people possess,
The greater disorder there is in the state.
The more diverse the people's skills,
The more unusual things they produce.
The more numerous the laws,
The more criminals there are.

Therefore, the sage says:
I take no action,
Yet people transform by themselves.
I prefer to remain calm,
Yet people by themselves become correct.
I refrain from meddling,
Yet people by themselves begin to prosper.
I have no desires,
Yet people by themselves become simple
Like uncut wood.
