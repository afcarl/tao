Tao is the source of the myriad things.
It is the treasure of those who are good.
It is the refuge of those who are bad.

Fine words can buy honor.
Fine deeds can serve as a gift.
Why reject those who are bad?

So when the emperor is installed,
And his ministers appointed,
Do not offer them precious stones and horses
But remain calm, offer the Tao.

Why did the ancients pay tribute to Tao?
Did they not use to say:
"Those who seek get what they seek thanks to Tao.
Thanks to Tao the offenders are saved"?
That is why Tao is the treasure to the world.
