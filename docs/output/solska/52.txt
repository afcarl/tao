The universe had a beginning.
This beginning is the mother of all.
When you know the mother,
You know her children, too.
When you know the children,
Go back to be with the mother
And throughout your life you will suffer no harm.

Close the passageways,
Lock the entryways
And throughout your life you will not get worn out.
Open the passageways,
Multiply your concerns
And throughout your life you will not be saved.

If you see the insignificant you have discernment.
If you can remain flexible you are strong.
Use the rays and return to the source of light.
Do not be the cause of your own distress.
This is the way of practicing the constant.
