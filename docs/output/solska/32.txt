Tao is invariably nameless.
Simple like uncut wood, it seems insignificant
Yet no one in the world can command it.
If kings and lords could follow it
The myriad things would salute them,
Heaven and earth would unite
And soft dew would fall,
People would live in harmony
Without any need for laws.

Begin to cut, begin to rule
And names will appear.
When names abound dividing must stop.
The Tao of the world is like rivers flowing into the sea.
