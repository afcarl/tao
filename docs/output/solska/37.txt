Tao invariably takes no action
Yet there is nothing left undone.
If kings and lords could follow it
The myriad things would transform by themselves.
And should they wish to take action once more
I'd quiet them
With nameless simplicity.
The nameless simplicity
Is like uncut wood:
It has no desires.
Without desires there is tranquility
And heaven and earth become stable by themselves.
