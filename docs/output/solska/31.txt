Fine weapons are the portents of evil.
Creatures seem to detest them.
So the people of Tao keep away from them.

In times of peace the wise favor the left side.
In times of war they favor the right.

Weapons are the portents of evil.
Not the tools of the wise.
Compelled to use them,
They do so without zeal.
Winning a victory,
They do not relish in it.
Those who delight in victory
Delight in the slaughter of people.
Those who delight in slaughter
Cannot attain their goals.

On happy occasions the left is the place of honor.
On mournful occasions - the right.
The rites of war are like the funeral rites:
The generals stand on the left,
The commander-in-chief on the right.

When multitudes are killed the mourners should grieve.
A war victory should be celebrated like a funeral.
