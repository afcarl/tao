In days of old these became whole:
Having become whole, heaven became clear.
Having become whole, earth became stable.
Having become whole, spirits became vibrant.
Having become whole, valleys became full.
Having become whole, the myriad things became alive.
Having become whole, the nobles set the realm right.
This is what they achieved by becoming whole.

If heaven had not become clear
It would likely break open.
If earth had not become stable
It would likely collapse.
If spirits had not become vibrant
They would likely cease to exist.
If valleys had not become full
They would likely become exhausted.
If the myriad things had not become alive
They would likely die.
If the nobles had not become esteemed
They would likely fall.

Thus the nobles have the commoners as their root.
And the high rank has the low rank as its base.
And the high rank has the low rank as its base.
That is why "orphans," "lonely" and "worthless"
Are the names kings and lords use for themselves.
Do they not have the commoners as their root?
Too much honor is no honor.
They don't wish to glitter like gemstones.
They prefer to rumble like rocks.
