When the best students hear of Tao
They follow it with all their might.
When average students hear of Tao
Sometimes they heed it sometimes they don't.
When the worst students hear of Tao
They laugh at it heartily.
Were it not laughed at,
Tao would not be what it is.

Thus it is said:
A path that is bright seems to be dim.
A path going forward seems to go back.
A path that is smooth seems to be uneven.
The highest virtue seems to be hollow.
The purest white seems to be sullied.
The amplest virtue seems insufficient.
The firmest virtue seems unsteady.
The genuine virtue seems to be fickle.
The greatest realm is without boundaries.
The finest talent matures late.
Harmonious music makes no noise.
The perfect form has no substance.

Tao is hidden and nameless.
Yet it is Tao that sustains all things
And brings them to completion.
