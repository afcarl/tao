Great Tao flows like a flood.
It can go left and right.
The myriad things depend on it for life
And it does not forsake them.
It does its work but lays claim to no merit.
It shields and nourishes the myriad things
And does not act as their lord.
Always desireless it may seem insignificant,
Yet the myriad things return to it
And it does not act as their lord.
Thus it may seem to be great.
The sage, too, does not strive to be great
So he is able to achieve greatness.
