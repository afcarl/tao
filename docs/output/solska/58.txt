When the government is dull and not meddlesome
The people are pure and honest.
When the government is shrewd and meddlesome
The people are restless and poor.

Good fortune leans on disaster.
Disaster lurks in good fate.
Is there a way to end this?
Is there a norm of what's right?
What's normal becomes abnormal.
What's good becomes evil.
With each passing day people grow more confused.

That is why the sage is sharp but he does not cut.
He burnishes but he does not harm.
He straightens but he does not break.
He shines but he does not dazzle.
