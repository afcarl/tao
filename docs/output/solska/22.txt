Be broken and you'll become whole.
Be fallen and you will stand tall.
Be empty and you will fill up.
Be worn and you'll become new.
Have little and you will gain.
Have much and you'll be confused.

Therefore the sage clings to the One
And serves as a guide for the world.
He does not flaunt himself, so he shines bright.
He does not insist on being right, so he is renowned.
He does not brag, so he succeeds.
He does not boast, so he lasts long.
He contends with no one,
So no one can contend with him.

The ancients used to say:
"Be broken and youâ€™ll become whole."
Are these but hollow words?
If you are truly whole everything will come to you.
