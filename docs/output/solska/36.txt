If you wish to make something small
You have to expand it.
If you wish to make something weak
You have to strengthen it.
If you wish to make something fall
You have to promote it.
If you wish to make something gone
You have to provide it.
This is called
Darkening what's bright.

What's soft and weak defeats what's hard and strong.
Fish should not be taken away from the ocean.
Sharp weapons of the state
Should not be shown to the people.
