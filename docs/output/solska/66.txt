How can rivers and oceans be king of one hundred valleys?
They excel in staying below them.
That is why they can become their king.

Thus if the sage wishes to be the people's master
He has to talk to them like their servant.
If he wishes to lead them
He has to follow behind them.
This way he can be their master
Without oppressing them.
He can precede them
Without blocking their way.
That is why the whole world is willing to praise him
And never tires of doing so.
He contends with no one,
So no one can contend with him.
