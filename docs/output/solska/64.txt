What is at rest is easy to hold.
What has not yet begun is easy to stop.
That which is flimsy is easy to shatter.
That which is tiny is easy to scatter.
Confront the events before they begin.
Set things in order before there is trouble.

A tree bigger than a grown man's embrace
Was once a tiny sprout.
A tower nine stories high
Was built on a lump of dirt.
A journey of a thousand miles
Begins right under your feet.

It's those who take action that fail.
It's those who hold on to things that lose them.
Therefore the sage takes no action,
And so he does not fail.
He doesn't hold on to things,
And so he doesn't lose them.
People always fail when their work is nearly done.
So be cautious when you start
And be cautious when you finish.
That is why the sage desires not to desire
And does not value rare things.
He learns what cannot be learnt
And returns to what others pass by.
He could help the myriad things
Follow their true nature
Yet he dares not do it.
