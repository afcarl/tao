There is something, complete and embracing all,
Born before heaven and earth took form,
Soundless and void,
Standing alone, unchanging,
Moving ahead, unceasing.
It seems to be the mother of the universe.
I do not know its name so I call it Tao.
Compelled to give it a name, I would call it Great.

Being great, it reaches far.
Reaching far, it flows everywhere.
Flowing everywhere, it returns to its source.

Indeed, Tao is great.
Heaven is great.
Earth is great.
Mankind is great, too.
These four are great in the universe
And mankind is one of them.

Mankind follows the rules of the earth.
The earth follows the rules of heaven.
Heaven follows the rules of Tao.
Tao follows its own rules, too.
