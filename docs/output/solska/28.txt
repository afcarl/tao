Be aware of what's masculine in you,
But preserve what is feminine in you,
And serve as a conduit for the world.
When you serve as a conduit for the world
Your true virtue will never be gone.
And you'll return again to the state of a newborn child.

Be aware of what is bright in you,
But preserve what is dark in you,
And serve as a guide for the world.
When you serve a guide for the world
Your true virtue will never falter,
And you'll return again to the state of boundlessness.

Be aware of what's praiseworthy in you,
But preserve what is base in you,
And serve as a valley for the world.
When you serve as a valley for the world
Your true virtue will grow ample enough,
And you'll return again to the simplicity of uncut wood.

Divided, the wood becomes a rod.
Used by a sage, the rod becomes a ruler's staff.
A great ruler keeps things whole; he does not divide.
