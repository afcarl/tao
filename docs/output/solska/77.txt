The Tao of heaven is like the bending of a bow.
What is high is brought down.
What is low is sent high.
What's excessive is reduced.
What's insufficient is increased.

The Tao of heaven takes from those who have too much
And gives to those who are in want.
The people's way is not like that.
They take from those who are in want
And give to those who have too much.
Yet who is able to have enough to give it to the world?
Only the one who has Tao.

Therefore the sage toils but expects no praise.
He does his work but does not dwell on it.
He does not wish to make a display of his merit.
