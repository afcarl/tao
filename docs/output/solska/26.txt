Being solid is the foundation of lightness.
Being calm is the ruler of haste.

Thus, the sage, when traveling all day,
Never parts with his luggage.
Seeing beautiful sights,
He remains unconcerned and calm.

Will the ruler of the myriad chariots
Let himself be frivolous?
If he's frivolous he will lose his foundations.
If he's rash he will lose rulership.
