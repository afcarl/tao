True words are not beautiful.
Beautiful words are not true.
Good people do not argue.
Those who argue are not good.
Those who know are not learned.
The learned do not know.

The sage accumulates nothing.
The more he does for others, the more he has.
The more he gives to others, the more he receives.

The Tao of heaven
Is to benefit, not harm.
The Tao of the sage
Is to act for others, not to contend with them.
