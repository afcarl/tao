Those who know do not speak.
Those who speak do not know.

Close the passageways,
Lock the entryways,
Blunt the sharp edges,
Untangle the knots,
Dim the bright light,
Unite earthly dust.

This is called
The secret unity.

Then there will be no way to like you
And no way to dislike you.
There'll be no way to assist you
And no way to harm you.
There'll be no way to honor you
And no way to shame you.
You'll then obtain the highest prize in the world.
