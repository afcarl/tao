Praise and condemnation both cause dismay.
Honor and great pain are bound up together.

Why do praise and condemnation both cause dismay?
Praise makes us low.
We're dismayed when we get it.
And we're dismayed when it's taken away.
That's why praise and condemnation both cause dismay.

Why are honor and great pain bound up together?
I'm bound to be in pain because I care about myself.
If I did not care about myself, what pain could I suffer?

If you respect the world as you respect yourself
You're ready to tend the world.
If you care about the world as you care about yourself
You're ready to rule the world.
