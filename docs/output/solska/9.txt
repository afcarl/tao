Fill a pot to overflowing
And you you'll wish you had stopped in time.
Hone a sword to the very sharpest
And it won't stay sharp for long.
Fill your halls with gemstones
And you won't be able to guard them.
Be proud with wealth and status
And you will cause your own fall.
Withdraw when your work is done.
This is the way of heaven.
