Seeking life we find death.
There are thirteen passageways of life.
There are thirteen passageways of death.
People take those thirteen passageways of death
And their lives proceed toward death.
Why? People care too much about life.

It has been said:
Those who are good at staying alive
Meet no buffaloes or tigers in the wilderness,
They've no use for armor and weapons on the battleground.
A buffalo can find no place to mark in them.
A tiger can find no place to claw.
A weapon can find no place to cut.
Why? There is no place for death in them.
