When people have no fear of what they should fear.
Something really fearsome will come on them.

Do not constrict their living space.
Do not reduce their means of livelihood.
If theyâ€™re not pestered they will not get weary.

Therefore the sage knows himself
But does not flaunt himself.
He loves himself
But does not exalt himself.
He chooses what truly has value,
Spurns what only seems that way.
