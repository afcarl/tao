The ancients who excelled at following Tao
Did not enlighten people
But kept them free from cleverness.

If people are too clever they are difficult to rule.
To rule the state with cleverness
Is to rob the state;
But to rule the state without cleverness
Is to benefit the state.

These are the two forms of rulership.
To remain aware of them is to have the secret virtue.
The secret virtue reaches far and touches all.
It leads all things back to the great accord.
