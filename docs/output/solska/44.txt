Your name or your life: which do you hold dearer?
Your life or your wealth: which truly has value?
Victory or loss: which truly gives pain?
If you care to a fault you will certainly suffer.
If you pile up your wealth you're bound to take a loss.
If you are contented you meet with no disgrace.
If you are able to stop you are free from danger.
You can then last through all time.
