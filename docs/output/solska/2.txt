To everyone in the world
Beauty seems beautiful because there is ugliness.
Goodness seems good because there is wickedness

Thus having and not having beget one another.
Difficult and easy complement each other.
The long and the short give rise to each other.
The high and the low support each other.
The voice and the sound harmonize each other.
Front and back follow one another.

Thus the sage manages affairs without taking action
And spreads his teaching without using words.
The myriad things flourish where he is
And he does not forsake them.
The sage creates but he does not possess.
He toils but expects no praise.
He does his work but does not dwell on his achievements.
It's because he does not dwell on them
That his achievements lasts.
