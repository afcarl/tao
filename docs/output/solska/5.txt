Heaven and earth are impartial.
The myriad things have no lasting value for them.
The sage, too, is impartial.
The people have no lasting value for him.

The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows.
Though empty, it does not collapse.
Work it and it will always yield more.
Waste your breath and your strength is soon gone.
It is better to hold firm to the core.
