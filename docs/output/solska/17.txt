Of the best leaders people barely know they exist.
Next come the ones people love and praise.
Then the ones they fear.
Then the ones they disdain.
Those who don't trust receive no trust.

The best leader is sparing in his use of words.
When his task is accomplished, when his work done.
Everyone says: "We did it ourselves."
