Rule a big country
The way you'd cook a small fish.

If Tao is used to govern the world
Evil spirits have no power.
Their power is not gone
But it does not harm the people.
Their power does not harm the people
And it does not harm the sage.
As they suffer no harm
Their virtues unite and return to them.
