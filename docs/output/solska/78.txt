There is nothing in the world softer than water.
And there's nothing weaker.
Yet for attacking the hard and strong
There is nothing better.
There is no substitute for it.

What is weak defeats what's strong.
What is soft defeats what's hard.
This is something known to all.
Yet this knowledge is used by none.

That's why the sage declares:
"If you bear the country's dishonor
You become the lord of its shrines.
If you bear the country's misfortune
You become the king of the world."

True words seem to sound wrong.
