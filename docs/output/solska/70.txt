My words are easy to understand
And it is easy to follow them.
Yet they can be grasped by no one in the world
And there is no one who can follow them.

My words are of an ancient origin.
My actions are guided by reason.
Yet this remains unknown,
So I remain unknown, too.
Those who know me are few
This is what honors me.
The sage wears plain clothing.
His true wealth is concealed in his heart.
