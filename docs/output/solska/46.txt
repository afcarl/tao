When the world follows Tao
Carriage horses work on the farm fields.
When the world lacks Tao
War horses are bred outside city walls.

There is no greater fault Than having many desires,
No greater defect Than not knowing when one has enough.
No greater tragedy Than the desire to obtain.
Thus knowing when one has enough
Is to always have enough.
