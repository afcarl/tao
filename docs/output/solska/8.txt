The highest good is like water.
Water benefits the myriad things and does not contend.
It flows to the low places that people disdain.
Therefore it becomes like Tao.

The value of a house is in its location.
The value of a mind - in the clarity of thought.
The value of companionship - in kindness.
The value of words - in truthfulness.
The value of governing - in justice.
The value of a doing a job - in effectiveness.
The value of taking an action - in timeliness.

If there's no contention, there is no blame.
