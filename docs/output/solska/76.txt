Living people are supple and soft.
When they're dead they are rigid and hard.
Living plants are pliant and green.
When they're dead theyâ€™re unbending and dry.
Thus what's rigid and hard accompanies death
And what's pliant and soft accompanies life.

If a soldier's too strong, he will suffer defeat.
If a tree is too hard it will be cut down.
The strong and big go down.
The soft and weak go high.
