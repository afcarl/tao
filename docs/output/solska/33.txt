Those who know others are clever.
Those who know themselves are enlightened.
Those who conquer others have strength.
Those who conquer themselves are powerful.
Those who are contented have wealth.
Those who move ahead have purpose.
Those who don't run away from their posts endure.
Those who die but don't perish live on.
