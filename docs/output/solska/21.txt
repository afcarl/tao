It is the mark of great virtue to follow Tao alone.

What can one say of Tao?
It is elusive; it's like a shadow,
It is intangible; it is like haze.
Elusive like a shadow, yet it holds ideas within.
Intangible like haze, yet it holds entities within.
Mysterious and dim, yet it holds spirit within.

Throughout all time
Its name has been retained.
Thus we can view the origin of all things.
How do I know the origin of all things?
I do because of what's within me.
