When the follower of Tao assists the ruler,
He'll advise him
Not to conquer the world with the force of arms.
Such actions will certainly rebound.
Thistles spring up where armies camp.
Bad harvests follow in the wake of great wars.

Attain your goal, then stop
And do not abuse your force.
Attain your goal without boasting.
Attain your goal without bragging.
Attain your goal without pride.
Attain your goal without gain.
Attain your goal without violence.

What expands too much is bound to collapse.
This is not the way of Tao.
What goes against Tao soon declines.
