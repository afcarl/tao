The best ruler has no personal ideas
And what the people think is what he/she thinks.
He/She is good to people that are good.
He/She is also good to people that are not good.
It is the goodness typical of the Way server.
He/She trusts people that are trustworthy.
He/She also trusts people that are not trustworthy.
It is the trust typical of the Way server.
The best ruler gives each breath of his/her life to the world.
He/She holds to just a simple mind,
But is looked up to and listened to.
He/She takes the whole world to be his/her children.
