Favor is invited and disgrace is feared,
As if they are a disastrous matter of life and death.
One is surprised when favor is bestowed.
One is again surprised when favor is lost
Or when one is afflicted with disgrace.
But why could they mean so much to us?
I would say I can have disasters
Only because I treasure my own life too much.
But if I live beyond my physical existence,
What disaster can matter to me?
Therefore, we should value our own life only to the extent
That we are supporting the world,
And love our physical existence only to the extent
That the world has been entrusted to us.
