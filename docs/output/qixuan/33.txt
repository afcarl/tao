One who knows others is clever.
One who knows one's self is wise.
One who can defeat others has energy.
One who can defeat one's self is strong.
One who is easily satisfied is rich.
One who drives one's self forth has will.
One who never loses one's place lives long.
One who never vanishes after death is eternal.
