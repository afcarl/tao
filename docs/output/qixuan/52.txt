The earliest beginning we can trace
Can be taken as the mother.
When we have come to know the mother,
We can then trace the son.
When we have found the son,
We should go back to stay with the mother.
Staying with the mother,
We are on the safest spot for our life.
Shut the eyes and cover the ears,
And one can stay away from worry all one's life.
Opening the door and rushing about all the time
Will not help save one from cares and trouble.
One who understands subtle details is wise.
One who keeps weakness is strong.
By adopting that subtle insight in the world,
One can avoid any danger.
That is called the inheritance of what is eternal.
