What is adaptable can remain whole.
What is bendable can be straight.
What is empty can be replenished.
What is used can be renewed.
One is satisfied when one gets barely enough.
One is overburdened when one gets too much.
Therefore,
The wise keeps the humblest life style
As a basic model for the world.
Unoccupied with one's own views, one is objective.
Unoccupied with one's own merits, one is recommended.
Unoccupied with one's own deeds, one is successful.
Unoccupied with one's own superiority, one is obeyed.
One gets the most if one gets nothing for one's self.
The old saying about flexibility holds true.
One sticks to it heart and soul, and it will work.
