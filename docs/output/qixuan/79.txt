Suppression of an uprising does not eliminate the revolt.
How can one solve the problem by suppressing?
The wise person prefers to be the owner of debts
Who gives for ever but presses for no paying back.
The wise contractor gives but does not take.
The poor contractor takes but does not give.
The way of Heaven favors none.
It gives all the time and only the good ones can receive.
