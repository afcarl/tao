What is still is easy to keep.
What has not developed is easy to guide.
What is fragile is easy to break.
What is little is easy to scatter.
One starts a project before things develop otherwise.
One prevents tumults before they happen otherwise.
A huge tree starts from a small sprout.
A nine-story tower starts from the first shovel full of dirt.
A long journey starts from the spot under the feet.
One who willfully starts a cause will ruin it.
One who willfully ends a cause will lose it.
The wise person does nothing willfully
And will therefore neither ruin nor lose.
People often fail when they are about to succeed.
If one is careful from start to end, one will not fail.
The wise ruler therefore desires what none would desire,
Values what none would value, learns what none can learn,
Remembers the useful experiences and lessons of all,
And does nothing willfully so as to help cultivate the natural.
