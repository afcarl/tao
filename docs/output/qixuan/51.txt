Things are produced by the Way,
Cultivated by their accumulation through time,
Realized in their forms by substances,
And guided in their development
By the potential in specific circumstances.
Therefore, everything respects the Way
And values what has been accumulated in the culture.
In the respected Way and valued accumulation,
Things grow and develop
By following their natural courses.
That's why we say that things are produced by the Way,
And, through diachronic accumulation, reared,
Cultivated, developed, matured, and protected naturally.
That process is the basic moral model for providers:
Produce without possessing anything,
Achieve without showing off anything,
And lead without making personal decisions.
