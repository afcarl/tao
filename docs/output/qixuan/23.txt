The ruler by nature says few words.
A sudden wind cannot last the whole morning.
A sudden rain cannot last the whole day.
Who produces them?
Heaven and Earth.
Since even Heaven and Earth cannot start a lasting cause,
How can mankind achieve that?
Therefore,
Those choosing the Way identify themselves with the Way,
Those choosing uses identify themselves with using,
And those choosing losses identity themselves with losing.
One identified with the Way is gladly provided by the Way.
One identified with using is gladly provided with uses.
One identified with losing suffers from the loss of the Way.
One who does not believe will find one's self not believed.
