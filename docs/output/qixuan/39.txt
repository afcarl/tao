Achievement of oneness in the past includes:
The heaven that became clear,
The earth that became peaceful,
The soul that became sensitive,
And kings that became the world's leaders.
The following can be inferred:
The heaven will break
If it can by no means clear up;
The earth will be wasteland
If it can by no means be peaceful;
The soul will die out
If it can by no means be sensitive;
And kings will go rampant
If they can by no means lead the world.
Therefore,
Nobility is rooted in the ordinary people,
And the high is based on the low.
The kings take names
Like "the Isolated," "the Helpless," or "the Wicked,"
Just because they appreciate their roots and bases.
Therefore,
The most glorious does not seek after glory,
And the wisest does not seek to be the beautiful jade
But the unrefined rough rock.
