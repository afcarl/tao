To one who keeps the Way, nature bestows its richest gifts.
The working of the Way cannot be clearly stated,
But one can find an image in its vagueness,
Substance in its obscurity,
Essence in its vast, uncertain expanse,
And confirmable manifestations of that essence.
What existed at the earliest beginning
Is existing now, in the developments of all beings,
And that is what helps me to know the nature of all things.
