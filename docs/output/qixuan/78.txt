Nothing is softer and weaker
And, at the same time, stronger, than water
While it is attacking the strong and hard in the world.
Only water can keep being the weakest steadfastly.
All the world knows the weak defeats the strong
And the soft defeats the hard,
But none can be courageous enough to do it.
Therefore, the wise person says:
"One who bears the worst disgrace
Is the glorious lord of a land;
One who suffers the worst disaster
Is the greatest savior of a nation."
The most truthful words always seem the most absurd.
