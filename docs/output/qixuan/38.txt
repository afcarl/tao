The virtuous getter does not get,
And is therefore getting something better.
The worst getter does not give what he/she gets
And is therefore getting something worse.
The best getter does nothing for nothing.
The kind giver does something for nothing.
The faithful contractor does something for something.
The ceremony holder does things but is not responded to,
For ceremony means lack of faithfulness
And the start of social disorders.
Predictive knowledge is the turbulence of the Way
And the beginning of folly.
Therefore, the reasonable person
Will stay in the thick center of the Way
Instead of its tumbling thin edge,
And will prefer the solid spot of the Way
Instead of its turbulence.
