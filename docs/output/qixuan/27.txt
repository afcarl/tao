A good walker leaves no trace.
A good speaker uses no blasphemy.
A good calculator uses no counting aids.
A good door-keeper needs no bars.
A good knot uses no strings.
Similarly,
A wise saver will part with no one.
A wise user will waste nothing.
It is the subtle insight that gives such abilities.
The wise person will be seen as the teacher for the unwise.
The unwise will be regarded as the resources for the wise.
One may be a mental genius,
But if he appreciates no teacher or other resources,
He is only a blundering fool.
The key is such teaching/learning.
