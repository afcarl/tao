There is a mixture of substances
That is born before Heaven and Earth.
Quiet, far and wide, it turns round and round by itself.
It can be taken as the mother of Heaven and Earth.
I don't know what its name is,
But for the purpose here, let's call it the Way
And describe it as "big."
By "big," I mean it is the most expansive.
What is expansive extends the farthest.
What goes farthest will turn round.
Therefore, the Way is big,
The heaven is big,
The earth is big,
And mankind is big.
In the universe, there are four big growth domains,
With mankind being one of them.
Mankind's nature is determined by Earth,
Earth's nature is determined by Heaven,
Heaven's nature is determined by the Way.
And the Way, being the biggest of all,
Copies its own growth nature.
