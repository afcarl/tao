How is it
That you hold your soul and body together?
Is it like a quiet infant
That you soften your breath?
Is it without any dust
That you clear your mind as a metaphysical mirror?
Is it without willful actions
That you love and take care of your country and people?
Is it without any dark corner
That you sense what is happening in the world?
Is it without misguiding knowledge
That you understand the whole world?
The metaphysical getter is one
That lets be everything that is born,
Produces without possessing anything surplus,
Achieves successes without being proud of them,
And rules well without any executive power.
