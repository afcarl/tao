The ancient wise ones seemed unattainably profound.
Since they were such, I can describe them only this way:
Hesitant as if they were crossing a winter river;
Inhibited as if they were afraid of their neighbors;
Undisciplined like melting ice on flowing water;
Simple-minded like a piece of rough plank;
Void like a vast-spreading empty valley;
And unenlightened like a muddled pool.
If anyone keeps the muddled state still,
It will gradually clear up.
If anyone keeps it still for long,
There will gradually be new production.
One who keeps this Way will not try to become filled.
Keeping unfilled, one is always ready for new successes.
