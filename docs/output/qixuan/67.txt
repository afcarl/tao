It is said that my Way is the biggest
And nothing could be like it.
Because it is the biggest,
There can be nothing like it.
If there were anything like it,
It wouldn't have been the Way.
I have three things to keep it:
One is motherly love; one is frugality,
And one is the courage to lag behind.
Cherishing motherly love, one can be the bravest.
Being frugal, one can give the most.
Lagging behind, one can grow to the fullest.
The absurdity of today is this:
Foolhardiness is preferred more than motherly love;
Wastefulness preferred more than frugality;
Front positions preferred more than growing to the fullest.
The result can be nothing other than death!
Cherishing motherly love,
An army is invincible,
And unconquerable,
Because it is protected by Heaven with love.
