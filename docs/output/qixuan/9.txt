Rather than possessing more and more wealth,
One would do better to give it all up.
Rather than forging sharper and sharper weapons,
One would get better protection by throwing them away.
One who gets a whole house of gold can not keep it.
One who is proud of wealth and status will suffer for it.
It is in agreement with the spirit of the Way
That one duly withdraws with his successes achieved.
