Thirty strokes radiate from the axle,
And there is a good working cart when it is empty.
Clay is given shapes for holding things,
And there is a good working ware when it is not full.
Windows and doors have been made,
And there is a good working house when it is not occupied.
Therefore, in general principle,
Seeking after being is for profit,
Keeping non-being is for use.
