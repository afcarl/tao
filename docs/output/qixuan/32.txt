The eternal Way has no name.
The earliest simplicity has no significance,
But its function is supreme.
If kings and officials can keep the Way,
The whole world will become their guest.
Harmony between heaven and earth creates rains and dews,
Which all share equally without laws or rules.
With the growth of the earliest system,
There appeared names, which are therefore conventional.
Knowing what is conventional,
One can also understand where and when to stop.
Knowing where and when to stop,
One will never meet with countering forces.
The Way is to the world what rivers are to the ocean.
