When people revolt,
Governmental prestige ends.
The ruler should always bear this in mind:
Never narrow the roads of life;
Never cause people to be dissatisfied with their existence.
For, satisfied with life,
None would revolt against the government.
The moral for the ruler is:
Know one's own shortcomings
Instead of being occupied with one's own views.
Appreciate others' appreciation
Instead of imposing one's self upon others.
That is how the wise person makes choices.
