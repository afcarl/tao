The Way is the pacifier appreciated by all.
It is the treasure of the wise and the shelter for the unwise.
Eloquent words can win respect.
Kind deeds can win praises.
Since the unwise are not affected,
Why should they be given up as hopeless?
Therefore,
It is better to sit down and present the Way
Than to present a king and officials to the world
And to give them a precious jade
And a carriage and four horses at the ceremony.
Didn't the ancient wise ones rightly appreciate the Way
Because it can both satisfy our needs
And forgive us for our sins and folly?
That is why the Way is the most respected.
