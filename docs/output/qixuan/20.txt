How much difference can there be
Between praise and criticism?
How similar goodness is to evil!
Why must one want and do
What everyone else wants and does?
What an absurd expanse of culture!
People hustle and bustle everywhere
As if they were enjoying a grand feast
Or climbing a spring tower.
I sit here, alone, like an infant that cannot giggle yet
And look forlorn as if I am homeless.
Everyone else is acquiring, possessing,
But I seem to be losing all the time.
Am I not foolish, indeed?
While others are decisive,
I am muddled.
While others are quick in judgment,
I am dull-minded.
I am like an ocean that cannot be easily stirred,
Or a wind that has nowhere to dwell.
Other people are intelligent, strong-minded, longheaded,
But I seem simple, foolish, slow.
I am different in that
I value only what provides my nourishment.
