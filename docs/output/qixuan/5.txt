The universe benefits none
And takes every being for a straw dog.
The wise king benefits none
And takes all people for nothing dearer.
Should we say that
It is just like bellows between Heaven and Earth?
It is empty but well propped up,
And any stir in it will cause spilling.
After all moralization and calculation,
It is a better strategy to keep that bellows empty.
