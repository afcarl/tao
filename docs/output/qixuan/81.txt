Truthful words are not beautiful.
Beautiful words are not truthful.
Good words are not eloquent.
Eloquent words are not good.
One who knows will not show off.
One who shows off does not know.
The wise person accumulates nothing.
The more one does for others, the more one achieves.
The more one gives to others, the more one receives.
The way of Heaven benefits by harming nothing.
The way of the wise person achieves
And receives by accumulating nothing.
