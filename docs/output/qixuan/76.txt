Life is soft and weak, death is hard and strong.
Plants are soft or fragile while living
And wither and harden while dying.
Therefore death grows in strength and hardness,
And life grows in softness and weakness.
A strong army perishes and a strong tree breaks.
What is hard and strong should not be valued,
And "the Above" should keep soft and weak.
