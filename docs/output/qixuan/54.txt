A well-founded establishment cannot be uprooted,
And a well-preserved tradition can not be dissolved:
Each will go on generation after generation.
One has true being when one keeps the Way body and soul,
Effective being when one extends the Way over the family,
Long being when one extends the Way over the community,
Rich being when one extends the Way over a nation,
Universal being when one extends the Way over the world.
Therefore, one knows others by looking at one's self,
Other communities by looking at one's own community,
Other states through the comparison with one's own state
And other worlds by inferring from one's own world.
That's how I come to know the world.
