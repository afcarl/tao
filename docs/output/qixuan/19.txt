Advocate no sage knowledge,
And people can benefit one hundred times as much.
Advocate no public welfare,
And people will turn to good and kindly feelings again.
Advocate no art and profit,
And people will not commit theft.
Those three are just roughly relegated
And cannot be fully clarified through words:
The best policy is to strive for simplicity,
To reduce selfish desires,
And to apply no confusing knowledge.
