A true gentleman admires no martial arts.
An invincible warrior never resorts to anger.
A true winner never appears in any encounter.
A wise employer never looks superior.
Holders of the true Way struggle for nothing of their own,
And depend on resources of strength other than their own.
The best ability of all time matches that of the heaven.
