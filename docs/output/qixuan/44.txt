Which is more precious, the body or the name?
Which is more important, the body or the goods?
Which is more harmful, gains or losses?
One who cares for reputation pays more.
One who possesses much fears death most.
Therefore,
One who is easily satisfied is not a disgrace.
One who knows where to stop is not stopped in life.
