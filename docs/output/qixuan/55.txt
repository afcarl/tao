The truest being can be illustrated by the infant.
Infants are not attacked by poisonous insects
Or by the birds and beasts of prey.
Though they are weak and fragile,
They have a firm grasp.
Though they don't know about sexual intercourse,
The male penises can naturally erect
(Which is the best embodiment of energy).
Though they can cry the whole day,
Their voices never crack
(Which is the best function of harmony).
Keeping harmony is keeping eternity.
The keeper of eternity can attain true wisdom.
Exertion of will beyond harmony is strength.
What is strong will soon weaken,
What is weakening is against the Way.
What is against the Way will die early.
