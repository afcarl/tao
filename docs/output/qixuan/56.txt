One who knows says nothing.
One who says knows nothing.
Cover the ears, close the eyes;
Blunt the sharpness, dissolve the currents;
Soften the light, blend the substances.
And the result is called the profound sameness.
One who holds that sameness cannot be
Approached too close,
Or estranged too far,
Or favored too much,
Or harmed too badly,
Or valued too high,
Or degraded too low.
And is therefore the most appreciated in the world.
