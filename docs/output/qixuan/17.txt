The best king rules so that people know that "there is a king."
The less wise king rules so that he is praised and loved.
The still less wise king rules so that he is feared.
The worst king rules so that he is cursed.
He who abides by nothing,
Who rules by saying and doing nothing misleading,
Achieves such political success that people all think
They are just following their own nature.
