Life and death co-exist in the same process.
The chance for life is thirty percent.
The chance for death is thirty percent.
The chance for death in the life's area is also thirty percent.
Why?
Because some live too actively for their lives.
It has been said that people good at living
Do not meet with tigers on land,
Or receive hits in battle.
Tigers can have no chance to apply their paws.
Weapons can have no chance to exert their edges.
Why?
Because people good at living have no chance of death.
