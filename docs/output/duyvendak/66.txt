That by which the River and the sea are able to be kings of the hundred valleys, is their fitness to be lower than these. That is why they are able to be the kings of the hundred valleys.
Therefore, if a Saint wishes to be above the people, he should, in his words, be lower. If he wishes to be in front of the people, he should in his person, be behind.
Therefore the Saint stays above but the people do not feel his weight; he stays in front but the people do not feel it as an injury.
Therefore All-under-heaven will gladly push him forward and will not weary (of him), Because he strives not, none are able to strive with him.
