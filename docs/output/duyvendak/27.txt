For a skilful traveller there are neither tracks nor traces.
For a skilful speaker there is neither blame nor praise.
A skilful reckoner used no counting-tallies.
A skilful 'closer' does not bar or bolt; yet to open (what he has shut) would be impossible.
A skilful binder does not twine or know; yet to loosen (what he has bound) would be impossible.
Thus the Saint is constantly good at saving men. Even of the not-good, who will be rejected?
He is constantly good at saving things: for he acts without rejecting things. This is called a twofold understanding. For a good man is the master of the not-good, and the not-good are the material for the good. However wise one may be, not to value one\s master, or not to be sparing of one's material, is a great error. This is called the chief wonder.
