Superior Virtue never asserts its virtue; therefore it has virtue.
Inferior virtue never abandons it virtue; therefore it has no virtue.
Superior Virtue neither acts nor aims.
Inferior Virtue acts and aims
Superior humanity acts but aims not.
Superior justice acts and aims.
(A man of) superior ritual conduct acts, and not finding response, he pulls up his sleeves and becomes aggressive.
Thus, once the Way is abandoned, thereafter Virtue is asserted; once Virtue is abandoned, thereafter humanity is asserted; once humanity is abandoned, thereafter justice is asserted; once justice is abandoned, thereafter ritual conduct is asserted.
Now ritual conduct is the thin shell of loyalty and good faith and the beginning of disorder. Foreknowledge is but a blossom of the Way and the beginning of folly.
Therefore, "the Great Adult" is concerned with what is think, and keeps not to what is thin; he is concerned with the kernel and keeps not to the blossom.
Therefore he rejects that and chooses this.
