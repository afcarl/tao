For governing men and serving heaven nothing is equal to moderation.
Just because there is moderation, this means applying oneself early (to the Way).
To apply oneself early is to garner a double (harvest of) Virtue, there is not a thing of which one is not capable, nobody knows the extreme limit (of that capacity). If nobody knows the extreme limit, one may possess a kingdom. The "mother" of possessing a kingdom may endure long.
This means that a deep root and a firm foundation are the way to long life and durability.
