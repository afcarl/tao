Attaining the utmost vacuity and earnestly observing quietness, while the ten thousand things all together are operating, I thus contemplate their return (to nothingness).
Indeed, things flourish luxuriantly, each to return again to the root (from which it sprang). To return to the root is called stillness; this may be described as surrendering one's trust.
Surrendering one's trust is called the constant (law). He who knows this constant (law), is called enlightened. He who does not know this constant (law), is foolishly active and comes to grief. He who knows this constant (law) forbears; forbeairng, he is unprejudiced; unprejudiced, he is all-embracing; all-embracing, he is great; great, he (knows) the Way; (knowing) the Way, he lasts; until the end of his life he is not in peril.
