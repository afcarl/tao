Abolish saintliness and reject knowledge: the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abolish humanity and reject justice: The people will return to filial piety and maternal affection.
Abolish skill and reject profit: thieves and robbers will disappear.
(Lest) these three be considered as (mere) words which are inadequate, let there be something to hold on to.
Display natural simplicity and cling to artlessness: decrease selfishness and diminish desires.
