Ruling a great state is like cooking a small fish.
If one governs All-under-heaven according to the Way, the manes (of the dead) will not manifest themselves as spirits. It is not that these manes are not spirits, but these spirits will not harm men. Just as the spirits will not harm men, the Saint will not harm the people.
If indeed these two do not harm one another, their Virtue will converge towards a common end.
