A great state is downstream. It is the converging point (of the water) of All-under-heaven. It is the female of All-under-heaven. The female always overcomes the male by stillness; by stillness she is underneath.
Therefore, by getting beneath a little state, a great state gains a little one, and by abasing itself to a great state, a little state gains a big one. The one gains by becoming low, the other by being low. A great state only wishes to unite men and feed them; a little state only wishes to be received and to serve others. So that each shall get what is wishes, the great must become low.
