In olden times those skilful in the Way had wonderful subtlety and mysterious penetration, so profound that it is impossible to understand them. Since, indeed, it is impossible to understand them, one can only try to the best of one's ability to describe their appearance.
How hesitant, like one who wades a stream in winter!
How circumspect, like one who fears his neighbours on all sides!
How reserved, like one who is a guest!
How fluid, like ice about to melt!
How solid, like uncarved wood!
How wide, like a valley!
How turbid, like muddy water!
What may allay the muddiness? Through stillness it will gradually become clear.
What may make repose lasting? Through movement it will gradually ensue.
Those who observed this Way did not desire to be full. Indeed, because they were not full, they could wear out without renewal.
