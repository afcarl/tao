When the Empire has the Way, (even) coursers will be stabled for the sake of their dung.
When the Empire is without the Way, warhorses will be raised in the suburb.
No guilt is greater than to approve of desire.
No disaster is greater than not to know what is enough.
No fault is greater than the desire to acquire.
For, to know that enough is enough is to have always enough.
