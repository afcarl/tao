The weakest thing in the whole world dashes against the hardest in the whole world. There is in all the world nothing softer or weaker than water, but in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it. Without substance it penetrates where there is no crevice; by what-is-not this becomes easy.
From this I know that non-action profits.
The doctrine without words and the profit of non-action, few in the world will attain to these.
Therefore the Saint abides by the practice of non-action, and professes the doctrine without words.
