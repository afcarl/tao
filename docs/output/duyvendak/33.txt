He who knows others, is knowing; he who knows himself, is enlightened.
He who vanquishes others, has power; he who vanquishes himself, is strong.
He who acts forcefully, has determination; he who knows contentment, is rich.
He who departs not from his allotted place, will last; he who dies without perishing, will have long life.
