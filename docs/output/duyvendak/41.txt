When a gentleman of top grade hears about the Way, he does his best to put it into practice.
When a gentleman of middle grade hears about the Way, he seems now to keep it, now to lose it.
When a gentleman of bottom grade hears about the Way, he will laugh loudly at it.
If it were not laughed at, it would not be worth regarding as the Way.
For there is an established saying:

"The bright Way looks dark.
The progressive Way looks retrograde.
The level Way looks rugged.
The highest Virtue looks like a valley.
Sheer white looks soiled.
The widest Virtue looks inadequate.
The firmest Virtue looks feeble.
The truest substance looks pitted.
The greatest square has no corners.
The greatest vessel is the last completed.
The greatest music has the rarest sound.
The greatest Image has no form.
The Way is hidden and without names. Indeed, just because the Way is able to lend it is able to complete."
