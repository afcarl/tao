All the world says that my Way, though great, seems unconventional.
Indeed, just because it is great, it seems unconventional. If it were unconventional, it would long ago have become minute.
I have three treasures which I hold and preserve.
The first is forbearance.
The second is moderation.
The third is not daring to be first in the world.
Having forbearance, I am able to be courageous.
Having moderation, I am able to be liberal.
Not daring to be first in the world, I am able to become the chief of all the "vessels".
If to-day one rejects forbearance but is only courageous, if one rejects moderation but is only liberal, if one rejects being last but is only first, it is death!
Truly, he who fights with forbearance, conquers; he who guards himself with it is safe.
Him, whom heaven would save, it protects with forbearance.
