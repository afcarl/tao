In highest (antiquity) one did not even know there were (rulers).
Next one loved them and praised them.
Next one feared them.
Next one despised them.
If good faith (of the prince towards the people) is inadequate, good faith (of the people towards the ruler) will be wanting.
Thoughtful were (the sage rulers), valuing their words!
When the work was done and things ran smoothly, the people all said: "We have done it ourselves!"
