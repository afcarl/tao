How ambiguous is the great Way! It may go left or it may go right.
The ten thousand things depend on it for their existence, and it denies them not.
When a work has been completed, it does not appropriate it.
It clothes and nourishes the ten thousand things, but it does not act as their master.
It may be named with the smallest things.
The ten thousand things revert to it, but it does not act as their master.
It may be named with the greatest things.
Because it never asserts its own greatness, therefore it is able to achieve its proper greatness.
