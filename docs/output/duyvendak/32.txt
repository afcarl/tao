The Way has the simplicity of the nameless. As soon as it is carved, there are names.
Since the names also exist, the Saint will now where to abide. He who knows where to abide, may be without peril.
The relation of the Way to All-under-heaven may be compared to that of torrents and valleys to the River and the sea.
