The plenitude of one who contains Virtue within himself, may be likened to that of an infant.
Poisonous insects will not sting it, fierce beasts will not seize it, nor will birds of prey claw it. Though its bones are weak and its sinews soft, it has a firm grip. Though it knows not yet of the union of male and female, its male member will stir. This is because the fine essence (in it) has attained the utmost (potency). Though it may scream all day long, its voice will not become hoarse. This is because the natural harmony (in it) has attained the utmost (potency).
To understand the natural harmony means being constant.
To understand being constant means being enlightened.
To increase life means inviting evil.
To control the vital breath with the mind means rigidity.
When things have matured they age. (Such control) is contrary to the Way. What is contrary to the Way will soon end.
