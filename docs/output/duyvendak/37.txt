If the vassal kings could abide by this, the ten thousand things would develop of themselves. If in this development desire should stir, I would suppress it by the (natural) simplicity of the nameless.

If the vassal kings could abide by this, the ten thousand things would flock to them of themselves. Heaven and earth would unite to send down sweet dew and the people, at no one's command, would spontaneously share alike.
Truly, they would become without desire. Being without desire they would be quiet, and All-under-heaven would of itself be settled.
