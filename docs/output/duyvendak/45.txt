Treat the most flawless (vase) as cracked, and it will not wear out in use.
Treat the fullest (vase) as empty, and it will not run dry in use.
Treat the straightest as crooked, the cleverest as clumsy, the most eloquent as stammering.
Stamping may overcome cold, but stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and stillness are what rectifies All-under-heaven.
