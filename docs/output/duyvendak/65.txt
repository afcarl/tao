Of old those who were well versed in the practice of the Way, rather than use it to enlighten the people, they used it to stultify the people.
If people are hard to rule, it is because of too much knowledge.
Therefore he who rules a state by means of knowledge, is like a robber of the state. He who will not rule a state by means of knowledge, is a boon for the state.
He who knows these two things, scrutinizes also the Measure.
Always to know how to scrutinize the Measure is called Mystic Virtue. Mystic Virtue is profound, is far-reaching, and operates contrariwise to things, till in the end it attains the Grand Conformity.
