A State may be ruled by rectification and a war may be fought by stratagems, but the Empire is gained by non-action.
The Empire is gained by remaining constantly in non-action. As soon as one becomes active, one is unable to gain the Empire.
How do I know that this is so? By this:
The more taboos and prohibitions there are in the Empire, the poorer the people will be.
The more useful implements the people have, the more state and dynasty will be in confusion.
The more cunning craftsmen there are, the more bizarre contrivances will spring up.
The more laws and ordinances are promulgated, the more thieves and robbers will there be.
Therefore a Saint has said:
"If I practice doing nothing, the people will of themselves be correct.
If I love stillness, the people will of themselves be correct.
If I practice non-action, the people will of themselves become rich.
If I practice being without desires, the people will of themselves become simple."
