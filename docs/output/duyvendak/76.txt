Man at birth is soft and weak; at death he is hard and rigid.
The ten thousand things, plants and trees, while alive, are soft and fragile; at death they are dry and withered.
For, what is hard and rigid is a follower of death; what is soft and weak is a follower of life.
Therefore, is a weapon is too rigid, it is destroyed; if a tree is too rigid, it breaks.
What is hard and rigid is placed below; what is soft and weak is placed above.
