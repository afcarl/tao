Those who of old attained the Unity (are the following):
Heaven attained unity and became clear.
Earth attained unity and became tranquil.
The spirits attained unity and became animated.
The valleys attained unity and became filled.
The ten thousand things attained unity and were produced.
The feudal kings attained unity and became rectifiers of All-under-heaven.
all this is effected (by unity).
If, by this, heaven were not clear, it is to be feared it might burst.
If, by this, earth were not tranquil, it is to be feared it might quake.
If, by this, the spirits were not animated, it is to be feared they might dissolve.
If, by this, the valleys were not filled, it is to be feared they might be exhausted.
If, by this, the ten thousand things were not produced, it is to be feared they might become extinct.
If, by this, the feudal kings were not noble and exalted, it is to be feared they might trip.
For the noble has the vile as its root; the exalted has the lowly as its base.
Therefore feudal kings call themselves "the Orphan", "the Lonely one", "the Destitute one". Surely this is because they regard the vile as their root!
For supreme honour attained is without honour.
Its desire is not to be finely carved like jade, but to be scattered like gravel.
