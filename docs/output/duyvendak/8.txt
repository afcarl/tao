The highest goodness is like water. The goodness of water consists in benefiting the ten thousand things without ever striving. It stays in the (lowest) place which all men loathe. Therefore it comes near to the Way.
What one values in a dwelling is the location;
What one values for the heart is depth;
What one values in human relations is humanity;
What one values in speaking is good faith;
What one values in ruling is good order;
What one values in serving others is ability;
What one values in action is timeliness.
Indeed, just because there is not striving, one may remain without blame.
