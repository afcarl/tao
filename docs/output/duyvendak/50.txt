Coming forth (man) is born, entering he dies.
Followers of life there are three in ten; followers of death there are three in ten; and men who, while regarding life as life, in their every act tend towards the death-spot, there are also three in ten.
Why is that? Because of the excessive manner in which they regard life as life.
For indeed, I have heard that one who has a firm purchase on life, when travelling overland, meets neither tiger no rhinoceros, and when going into battle, he wears no cuirass no does he bear arms. A rhinoceros would find nowhere to butt its horn, a tiger would find nowhere to fix its claws, weapons would find no room to enter their blades. Why is that? Because he has no death-spot.
