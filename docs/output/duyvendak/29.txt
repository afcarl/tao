Those who would seize All-under-heaven by means of action, - I have seen to what plight they come!
The spiritual vessel of All-under-heaven cannot me made. He who makes it, spoils it; he who holds it, loses it.
Therefore the Saint does nothing and so spoils nothing; he holds nothing and so loses nothing.
For things sometimes go forward, sometimes they lag behind; sometimes they breathe gently, sometimes they pant violently; sometimes they are strong, sometimes they are feeble; sometimes they start afresh, sometimes they decay.
Therefore the Saint avoids too much emphasis; he avoids extravagance; he avoids excess.
