The Way of heaven, how like the bending of a bow it is! What is up is pressed down, and what is down is raised up; the surplus is reduced, want is supplied.
The Way of heaven reduces where there is a surplus and supplies where there is want. The Way of men however is not thus; they reduce where there is want and proffer where there is a surplus.
Who is able to proffer his surplus where there is want? Only he who has the Way.
Therefore the Saint, when he acts, does not rely (on the results); when the work is accomplished, he does not rest in it.
The Saint does not hoard. Having regarded everything as belonging to others, he has greater abundance himself. Having given everything to others he has the more himself.
The Way of heaven brings profits but not harm. The Way of the Saint is to act but not to strive.
He has no desire to display his ability.
