Do by not doing, act by nonacting, taste the taste-less, regard the small as great, much as little.
Plan what is difficult where it is easy; do what is great where it is minute.
The hardest things in the world begin with what is easy; the greatest things in the world begin with what is minute.
Therefore the Saint never does anything great and so is able to achieve the great.
Now, he who promises lightly, will have but little faith. He who finds much easy, will find much hard.
Therefore the Saint, while finding even (the easy) hard, will in the end have nothing that is hard.
