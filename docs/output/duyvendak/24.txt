On tiptoe one does not stand.
Straddle-legged one does not go forward.
He who displays himself, shines not.
He who asserts himself, is not manifest.
He who boasts, succeeds not.
He who is conceited, does not become chief.
(Of such an attitude) in regard to the Way it may be said: "Superfluous food and redundant actions are loathed by all. Therefore, he who has the Way, does not concern himself with them."
