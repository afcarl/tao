He who is brave in daring, is killed.
He who is brave in not-daring, will live.
Of these two course the one is profitable and the other harmful. Who knows the cause of what heaven hates?
It is the Way of heaven not to strive and yet be able to conquer; not to speak and yet be able to respond; not to call and yet let things come of themselves; to be slow and yet be able to plan well.
Heaven's net is wide; though its meshes be far apart, nothing escapes it.
