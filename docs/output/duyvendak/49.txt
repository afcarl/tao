The Saint has no fixed mind. He makes the mind of the people his own, (saying): "The good I treat well, and the not-good I also treat well; thus I obtain goodness. Those of good faith I treat with good faith, and those not of good faith I also treat with good faith; thus I obtain good faith."
The Saint in Al-under-heaven makes no distinctions; he makes his heart impartial towards All-under-heaven. The people rivet their ears and eyes on him, and the Saint treats them all like infants.
