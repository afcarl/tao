The Way for the ten thousand things is like the southwest corner of the house.
It is the treasure of the good and the refuge of the not-good.
Fine words may buy honours, fine conduct may raise one above others.
Therefore, when the Son of Heaven is inaugurated or the Three Ducal Ministers are installed, though they may hold a jade disk and are preceded by a chariot and four, it would be better for them to sit still and make progress in the Way.
Why did the ancients prize this Way so highly? Did they not say: "he who seeks, finds by it; he who trespasses, escapes by it"?
Therefore it was the most prized in All-under-heaven.
