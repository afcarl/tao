Suppose that with only the least scrap of knowledge I were to walk the great Way, I would only fear turning aside. Though the great Way is quite level, people love bypaths.
When the Court is well purified, but the fields are full of weeds and the granaries are empty, (the rulers) wear decorated and embroidered robes, gird themselves with sharp swords, glut themselves with food, and have superfluous possessions; - this I call robbing and bragging.
It is certainly contrary to the Way.
