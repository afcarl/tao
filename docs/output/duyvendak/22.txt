What is bowed, becomes whole.
What is crooked, becomes straight.
What is hollow, becomes filled.
What is worn, becomes new.
He, who has little, acquires.
He, who has much, is deluded.
Therefore the Saint clings to the One and makes it into the measure of All-under-heaven.
He does not display himself; therefore he shines.
He does not assert himself; therefore he is manifest.
He does not boast; therefore he succeeds.
He does not feel conceit; therefore he becomes chief.
Indeed, just because he does not strive, in All-under-heaven there is none that can strive with him.
The old saying: "what is bowed, become whole", is surely not an empty word? It implies all that is truly whole.
