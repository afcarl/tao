A small country with few inhabitants where, though there be tools which can do the work of ten or a hundred men, (the people) may be induced not to use them!
Where the people may be induced to regard death gravely and not to move to distant places!
Where, though there be boats and carts, there would be nothing to load them with and where, though there are cuirasses and arms, there would be nowhere to drill in them!
Where the people may be induced to revert to the use of knotted cords, to savour their own food, to admire their own clothing, to take their ease in their own homes and to delight in their own customs!
Where, though a neighbouring country may be within sight, so that they hear each other's cocks crowing and dogs barking, yet the inhabitants, till they die of old age, would never meet one another!
