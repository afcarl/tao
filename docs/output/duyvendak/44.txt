Name or person; - which is nearest?
Person or goods; - which counts most?
Gain or loss; - which is worse?
For, the greater sparing the greater spending; the more hoarding the more loss.
He who knows contentment, will not be ashamed.
He who knows where to abide will be without peril.
He will last long.
