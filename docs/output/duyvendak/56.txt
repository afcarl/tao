He stops his apertures, he closes his doors.
"He blunts his sharpness, he unravels tangles, he dims brightness, he levels tracks.
This is called the mystic equality.
For in getting him one cannot come close nor remain distant, one cannot profit by him nor be harmed by him, one cannot gain honour by him nor suffer disgrace by him.
Therefore he is the most prized in All-under-heaven.
