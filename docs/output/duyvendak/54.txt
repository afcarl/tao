If one practices (the Way) in one's person, its Virtue will be genuineness.
If one practices it in one's family, its Virtue will be abundance.
If one practices it in one's village, its Virtue will be durability.
If one practices it in one's state, its Virtue will be prosperity.
If one practices it in the Empire, its Virtue will be universality.
From the standpoint of one's own person one views other persons, from that of one's own family other families, from that of one's own village other villages, from that of one's own state other states, from that of the Empire the Empire.
How do I know that it is like this for the Empire?
By this.
