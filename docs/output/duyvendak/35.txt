To him who holds the great Image, All-under-heaven will resort.
Those who resort to him, will suffer no harm, but will dwell in peace and union (with heaven and earth).
Music and dainties will make a passing stranger halt his steps.
But the words which are uttered about the Way, - how insipid and without flavour are they!
Looked at, it is not worth seeing.
Listened to, it is not worth hearing.
But used, it cannot be exhausted!
