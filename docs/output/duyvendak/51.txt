The Way produces them, Virtue rears them, things lend their form, environment completes their development.
Therefore the ten thousand things there is none but honours the Way and values Virtue.
Honouring the Way and valuing Virtue is not at somebody's behest but is always spontaneous.
For the Way produces, Virtue rears. They grow, feed, prosper, lead, support and shelter.
They produce and rear: they produce but do not appropriate, they act but do not rely (on the result), they grow but do not control.
When a work has been accomplished they do not rest in it. Indeed, just because they do not rest in it, they do not withdraw.
This is called the mystic Virtue.
