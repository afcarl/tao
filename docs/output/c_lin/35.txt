He who abides by the great Simulacrum (Truth) finds the people of the whole world eager to follow him.
By following him they are rendered free from harm, and peace prevails.
Like music and baits, he attracts all passers-by.
The utterance of Truth is insipid.
It cannot be seen with the eyes;
it cannot be heard with the ears;
it cannot be exhausted from constant use.
