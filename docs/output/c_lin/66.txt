That the rivers and seas are the lords of all waterways is because they occupy the lowest position, which fact is the cause of their lordship.
Wherefore, he who wishes to be above the people must be content to be at the bottom.
He who wishes to be at the head of the people must be content to be in the rear.
Thus the Sage occupies a superior position, and the people do not find it burdensome.
He occupies a leading position, and the people do not find it irksome.
Therefore the whole Empire takes delight, and is never weary of paying him homage.
Because he himself does not strive for superiority, there is none in this world who can contend with his superiority.
