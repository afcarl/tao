There is nothing in this world more supple and pliant than water.
Yet even the most hard and stiff cannot overcome it.
This is an irrefutable truism.
That the meek can overcome the strong, just as the supple can overcome the hard, is known to all people.
Only they fail to practise it.
A Sage once said:
"He who can suffer humiliation for the sake of his country is qualified to rule over a State.
He who can suffer calamities for the sake of his country is qualified to rule over an Empire."
