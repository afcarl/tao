Those who raise themselves on tiptoe cannot stand firm;
those who walk with long steps cannot travel far.
Those who are self-complacent are not enlightened.
Those who are self-important are not illustrious.
Those who are self-conceited are not successful.
Those who are self-assertive are not supreme.
Those who abide by Truth say:
"When one has a surplus of food and an excess of clothing, he causes envy in other men.
Therefore, the followers of Truth eschew these."
