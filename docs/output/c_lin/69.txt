One of the ancient strategists said:
"I do not venture to fight an offensive war;
I prefer to be on the defensive.
I dare not advance an inch;
I prefer to retreat a foot."
This indicates the futility of possessing armaments,
the reluctance to send armed expeditions,
the inexistence of casus belli,
the absence of foes.
Nothing can be more calamitous than an underestimation of the enemy's strength.
To underestimate the enemy's strength may cost a man his life.
In the event of war, those who regard it as a lamentable necessity will win.
