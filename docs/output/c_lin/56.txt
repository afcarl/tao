Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.
Stop up all the orifices of lust,
shut out all forms of distraction,
repress all manner of cunning,
unravel all causes of confusion,
eliminate all opportunities for rivalry,
remove all kinds of inequality,
- then there is great harmony.
When there is no cause for favour or disfavour, gain or loss, honour or disgrace,
the world will become rectified.
