Truth is the abode of the whole of creation.
It is treasured by good men, and it should also be treasured by bad men.
Good words enable one to obtain honour, and good conduct enables one to receive respect.
When a man is bad, why should we spurn him?
Wherefore, it is better to advance toward Truth than to be an Emperor, or a Grand Minister, or a royal messenger wearing precious jades and riding in fine carriages.
Why did the ancients esteem Truth?
Was it not for the reason that by following Truth men could obtain what was desirable and avoid what was undesirable?
Because of Truth they could rule the whole Empire.
