When one desires to win over an Empire by action, I find that he will never have a moment of rest.
The possession of an Empire is something ordained by the gods.
It cannot be gained by action, or held.
Those who try to gain by action are sure to fail;
those who try to hold are sure to lose.
As regards the things of this world, they are constantly alternating:
they lead, they follow;
they inhale, they exhale;
they are strong, they are weak;
they rise, they fall.
Wherefore, the Sage eschews that which is excessive, extravagant, or superfluous.
