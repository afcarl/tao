The most perfect appears as though he were imperfect, and his beneficence is inexhaustible.
The most complete appears as though he were incomplete, and his usefulness is limitless.
The most upright appears as though he were crooked.
The most skillful appears as though he were stupid.
The most eloquent appears as though he were inarticulate.
Calm can overcome unrest; heat can overcome cold.
With purity and quiescence of mind, one may rule supreme in this world.
