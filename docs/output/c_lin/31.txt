The weapons of war are implements of disaster, and they should not be employed by the rulers except when it is unavoidable.
They should not show enthusiasm for their employment, and even when they are victorious, they should not glorify them.
To glorify them means taking delight in the killing of men.
Those who take delight in the killing of men cannot win the approval of the whole Empire.
The weapons of war are the implements of disaster, and they are detestable.
Therefore they are spurned by the followers of Truth.
Ordinarily the ruler esteems the left hand, but in war he esteems the right hand.
On joyful occasions, the left-hand side is the place of honour,
but on mournful occasions, the right-hand side is the place of honour.
The general second in command is seated on the left-hand side, and the general-in-chief is seated on the right-hand side.
All these indicate that war should be regarded as a mournful occasion.
When many people are killed, it should be an occasion for the expression of bitter grief.
Even when a victory is scored, the occasion should be regarded as lamentable.
