When one wishes to expand, one must first contract.
When one wishes to be strong, one must first be weak.
When one wishes to rise, one must first fall.
When one wishes to take, one must first give.
This is called mere truism.
Meekness can overcome hardness, and weakness can overcome strength.
Fishes cannot survive after leaving deep waters.
The State must not leave the weapons of war in the hands of the people.
