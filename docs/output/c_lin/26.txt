That which is weighty has its source in that which is light.
That which is tranquil can subdue that which is disquiet.
Wherefore, the Sage always conducts himself gravely and tranquilly.
Though he may be surrounded by splendour and comfort, he is always reposeful and disinterested.
When the ruler conducts himself lightly, he loses the respect of his ministers.
When he conducts himself with disquietude, he loses the support of his people.
