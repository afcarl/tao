True words may not be specious, and specious words may not be true.
Good words may not be convincing, and convincing words may not be good.
Wise men may not be learned, and the learned may not be wise.
The Sage gives without reservation.
He offers all to others, and his life is more abundant.
He helps all men alike, and his life is more exuberant.
The way of Heaven is to benefit, and not to harm.
The way of the Sage is to give, and not to strive.
