When one is daring to the point of recklessness, he will meet with violent death.
When one's daring is tempered by caution, he will find his life secure.
Of these two types, one is beneficial and the other harmful.
Who knows the cause of Heaven's preference?
The way of Heaven is victorious, and there is no strife convincing, and there is no speech;
responsive, and there is no compulsion;
sure of success, and there is no haste.
The rule of Heaven is extensive and comprehensive, slow but sure.
