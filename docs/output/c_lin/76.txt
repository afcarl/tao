When a man is alive, his body is supple and pliant.
When he is dead, it is hard and stiff.
When a plant is alive, it is supple and pliant.
When it is dead, it is dry and brittle.
Therefore,
to be hard and stiff is the way of death;
to be supple and pliant is the way of life.
A stiff weapon may break, just as a stiff tree may crack.
That which is hard and stiff occupies a disadvantageous position.
That which is supple and pliant occupies an advantageous position.
