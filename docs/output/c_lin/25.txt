There is something evolved from chaos, which was born before heaven and earth.
It is inaudible and invisible.
It is independent and immutable.
It is all-pervasive and ceaseless.
It may be regarded as the mother of heaven and earth.
I do not know its name and call it Truth or Daw.
If I must describe it, I will say that it is great, active, far-reaching, and cyclical in its motion.
Thus Truth is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great.
Within the universe there are four great ones, and the king is one of them.
The king must follow the examples of earth, heaven, Truth, and Nature.
