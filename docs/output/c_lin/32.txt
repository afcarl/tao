Truth is the name given to that which was originally nameless and simple.
Though small, the whole world cannot subjugate it.
When the rulers abide by it, all animate creation will of their own accord become their servants.
Because heaven and earth are one with Truth, they produce rains and dews which benefit all mankind alike without their asking.
The name was fabricated by man.
Since it has been given a name, the rulers ought to know it.
When they know it, they will be free from danger.
Truth is to the universe as rivers and seas are to the earth.
