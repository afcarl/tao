Good conduct leaves behind no traces.
Good words afford no room for criticism.
Good mathematicians require no calculating apparatus.
Good lids need no bolts, and they cannot be opened.
Good fasteners need no cords, and they cannot be released.
The Sage, by his abiding goodness, saves mankind because he spurns no one.
He, by his abiding goodness, saves the inanimate creation because he spurns nothing.
This is called mutual understanding.
Wherefore,
the good man should be the teacher of the bad man;
the bad man should serve as a lesson for the good man.
When one fails to esteem his teacher, or the other fails to value his lesson, each is under a great illusion, though each may possess erudition.
This is called obscure conception.
