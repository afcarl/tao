Man begins with life, and ends with death.
During the span of man's existence,
three-tenths of it are passed in the processes of growth;
three-tenths are passed in the processes of decay.
That which is meant for the development of life but which is passed in the processes of decay also constitutes three-tenths.
Why is this so?
Because man over-taxes the life force.
It has been said that he who knows how to preserve life avoids the rhinoceros and tigers when travelling by land;
dodges arms and weapons when engaged in battle with a hostile army.
He sees to it that the rhinoceros have no opportunity to use their horns;
that tigers have no opportunity to use their claws;
that enemies have no opportunity to use their weapons.
Why is this so?
Because man avoids the risks of death.
