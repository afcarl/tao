With learning one aims at constant augmentation.
With Truth one aims at constant diminution.
The diminution continues and continues until the state of inaction is reached.
Because of inaction, nothing is left undone.
When one constantly abides by inaction, he can win an Empire.
If he does not abide by inaction, he will never be able to win an Empire.
