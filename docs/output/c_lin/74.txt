When the people are not afraid of death, why try to frighten them by capital punishment?
If the people are really afraid of death and when the wrongdoers are promptly executed, who will dare to do wrong?
There should be a certain authority to decide on the death of men.
If the decision of death is given to other men than the qualified party, it is comparable to asking a novice to do the work of a master-craftsman.
In so doing, the novice seldom escapes injuring his hands.
