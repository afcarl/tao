The Sage has no fixed prejudices, but always regards the hearts of all mankind as his own.
Those who are good, he treats well;
those who are not good, he also treats well.
Thus he finds only good men.
Those who are sincere, he believes;
those who are not sincere, he also believes.
Thus he finds only sincere men.
The Sage wishes that all men in this world will soon return to simplicity.
While people in general strain their ears and eyes, the Sage wishes to have them all sealed.
