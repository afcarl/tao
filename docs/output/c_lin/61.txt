In order to govern a large State, one must practise humility.
The father of an Empire should behave as though he were the mother.
The female willing to occupy a subordinate position uses quietude to subjugate the male.
Thus,
when a large State is humble, it can win over the small States;
when a small State is humble, it can win over the large States.
In the case of the large States, humility makes them desirous of protecting all men, and no more.
In the case of the small States, humility makes them desirous of serving all men, and no more.
These obtain what they desire because they practise humility.
