The great Truth is all-pervasive and may be found everywhere.
It gives life to all animate creation, and yet it does not claim lordship over them.
It accomplishes all things, and yet it does not claim anything for itself.
It embraces all things, and yet it has no fixed abode.
It abides by inaction, and may be considered minute.
It is the ultimate destiny of all animate creation though it is not conscious of it, and it may be considered great.
Because it is never conscious of its greatness, it becomes truly great.
