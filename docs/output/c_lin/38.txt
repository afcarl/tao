The most virtuous is not conscious of being virtuous, and therefore he attains virtue.
The least virtuous is always afraid of losing virtue, and therefore he fails to attain virtue.
The most virtuous abides by inaction, and nothing is left undone.
The least virtuous is always employed with action, and much is left undone.
When benevolence is most highly esteemed, people practise it for its own sake.
When righteousness is most highly esteemed, people practise it for their own good.
When propriety is most highly esteemed, people practise it because they are compelled to.
Thus,
virtue becomes fashionable when people fail to follow Truth;
benevolence becomes fashionable when people fail to attain virtue;
righteousness becomes fashionable when people fail to practise benevolence;
propriety becomes fashionable when people fail to practise righteousness.
The rules of propriety are brought about by the lack of loyalty and sincerity, and by the prevalence of confusion.
Learning is pushed to the fore when Truth is disregarded as a matter of no importance, and when hypocrisy begins to prevail.
Therefore the truly great men dwell in what is fundamental, and shun what is trivial;
they abide by what is real, and discard what is ornamental.
