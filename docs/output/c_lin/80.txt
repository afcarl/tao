The State should be small, and its inhabitants should be few.
Its ruler should teach the people to shun arms and weapons even though they are available.
He should teach the people to avoid the risks of death, and to be reluctant to travel in distant countries.
Thus though there might be ships and carriages, they would have no need to mount them.
Though there might be arms and weapons, they would have no need to use them.
He should make the people return to the state of pristine simplicity where the system of knotting threads was used.
Then they would relish the food they eat;
consider beautiful the clothes they wear;
regard as comfortable the houses they dwell in;
enjoy the customs they have.
The State may be so closely situated that the barking of dogs and the crowing of cocks in one may be heard in the other.
Thus the people would be content to live in their own country from the time of their birth until their death without thinking of foreign intercourse.
