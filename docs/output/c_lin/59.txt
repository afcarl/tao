In governing men and serving Heaven, there is nothing better than temperance.
In order to practise temperance, one must first follow Truth, and this means adherence to the inherent qualities.
When one adheres to the inherent qualities, he becomes invincible.
When he is invincible, he also becomes unfathomable.
When he is unfathomable, he also becomes one with Truth.
When he is one with Truth, he becomes everlasting.
This is the way to attain immortality.
