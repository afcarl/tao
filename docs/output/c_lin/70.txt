My teaching is very easy to understand and very easy to practise.
Yet the world does not understand or practise it!
My teaching has its basis, and my conduct has its reason.
Because the world is ignorant of them, I am misunderstood.
There are few who understand me, and those who abuse me are placed in positions of honour.
Therefore the Sage must dress in coarse robes while hiding precious jewels within his breast!
