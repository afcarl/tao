When chaos has not yet appeared, it is easy to maintain peace.
When portents have not yet appeared, it is easy to devise measures.
When a thing is brittle, it can be easily broken.
When a thing is minute, it can be easily dispersed.
Measures should be adopted to forestall future emergencies.
Action should be taken to safeguard against possible confusion.
A giant tree whose trunk measures several feet in diameter is grown from a tiny seed.
A tall tower nine storeys high is built upon basketfuls of earth.
A long journey of a thousand lii is covered step by step.
Those who try to gain by action are sure to fail;
those who try to hold are sure to lose.
Because the Sage abides by inaction, he does not fail.
Because he does not try to hold, he does not lose.
Men often fail in their undertakings when they are on the verge of success.
If the same care is exercised towards the end as at the beginning, they can never fail.
Wherefore, the Sage has no desires, covets not rarities, and acquires not learning in order that he may avoid the faults of the multitude.
He promotes the spontaneous development of all things, and does not venture to interfere by his own action.
