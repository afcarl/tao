The way of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow!
The bulge is levelled;
the depression is raised;
the excess is diminished;
the deficiency is replenished.
The way of Heaven is to diminish excess, and replenish deficiency.
The way of man is the opposite.
He robs the poor to serve the rich.
Who can give all he has to serve the world?
Only the follower of Truth.
Thus the Sage gives without the wish for return;
he achieves without claiming credit.
Is this not because he wishes to conceal his worth?
