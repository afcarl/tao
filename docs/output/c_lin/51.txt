It is Truth that gives both life and form to things.
The nature of a thing determines its individuality and perfection.
Therefore, as regards all things, Truth and Nature are the most important.
The importance of Truth and Nature is a matter of course, and requires no comment.
Truth gives birth to life.
Nature determines the individuality, growth, development, completion, maturity, protection, and security of a thing.
The mysterious Nature is that which lives without the desire for ownership, gives without the wish for return, rules without claiming lordship.
