Boisterous gales do not continue unabated from morn till eve.
Torrential rainfalls do not continue unabated throughout the day and night.
Who is it that produces these phenomena?
Heaven and earth.
Since these phenomena cannot last for ever, how much less can the work of man!
Those who follow the way of Truth will meet in Truth.
Those who follow the way of virtue will meet in virtue.
Those who follow the way of Heaven will meet in Heaven.
Those who meet in Truth become one with Truth, and they rejoice in it.
Those who meet in virtue become virtuous, and they rejoice in it.
Those who meet in Heaven become heavenly, and they rejoice in it.
