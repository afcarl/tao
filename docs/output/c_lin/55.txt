When the inherent qualities are completely preserved, one is like a new-born babe.
Poisonous insects will not bite him, ferocious beasts will not crouch in wait for him, predatory birds will not attack him.
Though his body is weak and supple, yet he has a firm grip.
Though he is ignorant about the reproductive organs, yet he possesses them all.
This is because he is full of the elemental force.
He may cry all day, yet he never loses his voice.
This is because he attains the perfect harmony.
When the elemental force is in perfect harmony, there is normalcy.
When one knows normalcy, there is enlightenment.
When one tampers with life, there is calamity.
When the heart is subservient to the will, there is compulsion.
