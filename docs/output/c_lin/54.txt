He who knows how to establish himself cannot be uprooted.
He who knows how to hold fast cannot lose his grip.
The descendants of such a man will worship him without cease.
When one's conduct is in accordance with Truth, the inherent qualities become real.
When a whole family follows Truth, the inherent qualities become abundant.
When a whole village follows Truth, the inherent qualities become enduring.
When the whole State follows Truth, the inherent qualities become superabundant.
When a whole Empire follows Truth, the inherent qualities become universal.
Thus,
one man is the measure of other men,
one family is the measure of other families,
one village is the measure of other villages,
one State is the measure of other States,
and one Empire is the measure of other Empires.
