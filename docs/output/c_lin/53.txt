If I am truly enlightened and travel the way of great Truth, I should always feel apprehensive lest I deviate from it.
The way of great Truth is most easy to travel, yet men prefer the by-paths.
The Court is very corrupt, the fields are much neglected, the granaries are much depleted;
yet there are men who still don expensive dresses, carry sharp swords, gorge themselves with food and wine, and wallow in superfluous wealth.
These men may be called the captains of robbers.
