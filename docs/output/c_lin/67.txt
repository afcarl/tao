The world thinks that Truth which I describe is so great that it seems unreal.
It seems unreal because it is indeed so great.
If it were considered real, then it must be small.
There are three treasures which I cherish as the most precious.
The first is compassion.
The second is frugality.
The third is humility.
Because of compassion, there is courage.
Because of frugality, there is liberality.
Because of humility, there is supremacy.
Perdition will be the lot of those who choose courage, and abandon compassion;
who choose liberality, and abandon frugality;
who choose supremacy, and abandon humility.
When there is compassion, one can be victorious in an offensive war, and hold his position in a defensive war.
Because of the compassion of such a man, Heaven will deliver and protect him.
