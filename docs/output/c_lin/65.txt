The ancients who knew Truth well did not make the people acquire learning, but kept them in the state of simplicity.
The people become difficult to govern when they are full of wiles.
Therefore,
the ruler who relies on learning does harm to the State;
the ruler who relies not on learning does good to the State.
These two ways are the ways of government.
When one always follows the right course, he acts in accordance with the mysterious Nature.
The mysterious Nature is profound and far-reaching.
When things revert to it, there is great concord.
