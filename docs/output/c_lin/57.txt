When one rules the State with uprightness, and uses stratagem in war,
he cannot hope to win over a whole Empire.
How do I know that this is true?
Because of the following:
When there are many prohibitory statutes in the Empire, the people become the more impoverished.
When the people possess numerous weapons of war, the State becomes more chaotic.
When men possess much skill and cunning, there is an increase of fanciful goods.
When there is a profusion of laws and regulations, banditry becomes rife.
Therefore, one of the Sages said:
"I abide by inaction, and the people reform themselves.
I esteem quietude, and the people rectify themselves.
I make no effort, and the people enrich themselves.
I have no desires, and the people of their own accord practise simplicity."
