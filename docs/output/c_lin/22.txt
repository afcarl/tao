The imperfect becomes perfect.
The old becomes new.
The crooked becomes straight.
The empty becomes full.
Loss means gain.
Plenitude means confusion.
Wherefore, the Sage holds fast to Truth and thereby sets an example for the world.
Because he is not self-complacent, he becomes enlightened.
Because he is not self-important, he becomes illustrious.
Because he is not self-conceited, he becomes successful.
Because he is not self-assertive, he becomes supreme.
Because he himself does not strive for superiority, there is none in the world who can contend with his superiority.
There is an old saying:
"The imperfect becomes perfect."
How true are these words!
In order to revert to the whole, one must abide by what is normal and natural.
