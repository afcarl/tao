Fame and life, - which is the more precious?
Life and property, - which is the more important?
Gain and loss, - which is the more to be preferred?
Inordinate love will surely result in abandonment.
Over-hoarding will surely end in heavy loss.
He who knows contentment will not suffer disgrace.
He who knows when to stop will not incur danger.
