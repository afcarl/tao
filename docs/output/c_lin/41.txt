When the highest type of men hear of Truth, they forthwith sedulously practise it.
When the average type of men hear of Truth, they are unimpressed.
When the lowest type of men hear of Truth, they greatly deride it.
Indeed, if these men do not deride it, it is surely not Truth.
Wherefore it is said in the Book of Jiann-Yan:
"The one who understands Truth appears as though he did not understand it.
The one who advances toward Truth appears as though he were retreating from it.
The one who finds the way of Truth easy appears as though he found it difficult."
The most virtuous appear as though they were devoid of virtue.
The virtuous who can impart virtue to others appear as though they were incapable.
The virtuous who are strong appear as though they were weak.
The virtuous who are solid appear as though they were unreal.
The most pure appears as though it were impure.
The perfect square is cornerless.
The greatest achievement is slow of completion.
The highest note is inaudible.
The great Simulacrum is formless.
The great Truth is nameless.
It is only Truth that excels both in giving and achieving.
