Abide by inaction.
Do not crave for accomplishment.
Discard learning.
Regard great, small, much and little as the same.
Deal with what is easy as though it were difficult;
with what is trivial as though it were important.
The world's difficult tasks may appear easy in the beginning, just as the world's great achievements may appear small in the beginning.
Because the Sage does not go about great undertakings, he is able to accomplish great things.
He who lightly makes promises will surely be found wanting in good faith.
He who often underestimates difficult tasks will surely be beset with difficulties.
Because the Sage is always aware of the existence of difficulties, he never encounters difficulties.
