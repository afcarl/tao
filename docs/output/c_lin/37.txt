Truth abides by inaction, and yet nothing is left undone.
If the rulers abide by Truth, all animate creation will of their own accord come under their influence.
When they of their own accord come under their influence, and if selfish desires arise, I would tranquillize them with the nameless simplicity (Truth).
Once tranquillized by the nameless simplicity, they will again be free from selfish desires.
Thus free from selfish desires, they will be calm, and the world will of its own accord become peaceful.
