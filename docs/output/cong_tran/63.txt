Do non-doing.
Carry out no-work.
Taste the tasteless.
Make the small big.
Make the little much.
Render Virtue to enmity.
Plan the difficult when it is still easy.
Accomplish the great when it is still small.
Difficult things in the world can be achieved in what is easy.
Big things in the world can be achieved in what is minute.
Thus, the sage never does big things, yet by that he is capable of achieving them!
He who promises lightly must rarely fulfill it.
He who thinks a thing easy will find it difficult.
Therefore, the sage, who regards everything as difficult, meets with no difficulties in the end.
