Nothing in the world is softer and weaker than water; but, for attacking the hard and strong, there is nothing like it!
For nothing can take its place.
The weak overcomes the strong, and the soft overcomes the hard.
This is something known by all, but practiced by none.
Therefore, the sage says: To receive the blame of a country is to be the lord of its soil-shrines.
To bear the calamities of a country is to be the king of the world.
Indeed, the truth sounds like its opposite!
