Governing a big state is like cooking a small fish.
When a man of the Way reigns over the world, demons no longer have spiritual powers.
Not that the demons have no spiritual powers, but the spirits themselves do no harm to men.
Not that the spirits do no harm to men, but the sage himself does no harm to his people.
If the sage and his people refrain from harming each other, Virtue will return.
