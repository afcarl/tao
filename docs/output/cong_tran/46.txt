When the world is reigned by the Way, the galloping horses are led to fertilize the fields with their droppings.
When the world is wayless, war horses breed themselves on the suburbs.
There is no greater calamity than not knowing "enough".
There is no greater evil than will to gain.
Therefore "enough" of knowing "enough" is constant "enough".
