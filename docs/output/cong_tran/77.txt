Is the Way of Heaven similar to a stretched bow?
The upper part is pressed down, while the lower is raised.
The overfull part is reduced, the deficient part is supplemented.
The Way of Heaven is to reduce what is overfull and to supplement what is deficient.
The way of man is different: it reduces what is deficient and supplements what is overfull.
Who, except the man of the Way, can put his excessive riches to the service of the world?
Therefore, the sage does his work without saying it is done by him, accomplishes his task without dwelling upon it.
He does not want his merits to be seen.
