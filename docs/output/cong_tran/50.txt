"Out" is life; "In" is death.
Three in ten are followers of life.
Three in ten are followers of death.
Three in ten live as man but act in the realm of death.
How is this?
Because they all crave life.
It is said that he who knows well how to live meets no tigers or rhinoceroses on his road, and comes into the battlefield untouched by the weapons.
For, in him, a rhinoceros would find no place for his horns, a tiger no place to lay his claws upon, and a weapon no place to lodge its point.
How is this?
Because there is no room for death in him.
