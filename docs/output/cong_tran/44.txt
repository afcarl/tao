As for your name and your self, which is the dearer?
As for your self and your wealth, which is the more to be prized?
As for gain or loss, which is more painful?
Thus, extreme love leads to great cost.
Much storage leads to heavy loss.
To know when to have enough is to be immune from disgrace.
To know when to stop is to be preserved from danger.
Only thus can you last long.
