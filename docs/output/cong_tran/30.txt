He who knows how to guide a ruler in the path of the Way does not try to override the world with force of arms.
It is in the nature of arms to turn against its wielder.
Wherever armies are stationed, thorny bushes grow.
After a great war, bad harvests follow.
After victory, to protect efficiently one's own state, one should not to rely on force.
Victory without claiming ability.
Victory without claiming success.
Victory without being proud.
Victory but saying it is not one's will.
Victory with no longer relying on force.
A thing at its strength begins to become old; this is against the Way; what is against the Way will soon cease to be.
