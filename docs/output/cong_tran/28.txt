To know the masculine, to keep to the feminine, that is to be the brook of the world.
To be the brook of the world is to move constantly in the path of Virtue without swerving from it, and to return again to infancy.
To know the white, to keep to the black, that is to be the model of the world.
To be the model of the world is to move constantly in the path of Virtue without erring a single step, and to return again to infinite nothingness.
To know the glorious, to keep to the humble, that is to be the fountain of the world.
To be the fountain of the world is to live the abundant life of Virtue, and to return again to the uncarved block.
When the uncarved block stops being uncarved, it becomes useful vessels.
When the sage uses them, they become officials.
Hence, "A great tailor does not cut."
