In the remote past there were those who attained the One.
Attaining the One, heaven is clear.
Attaining the One, earth is calm.
Attaining the One, God is holy.
Attaining the One, the cave is full.
Attaining the One, ten thousand creatures come into life.
Attaining the One, kings and princes become sovereign rulers of the world.
All of them are what they are by virtue of the one.
If heaven were not clear, it would fall to pieces.
If earth were not calm, it would quake.
If God were not holy, he would cease from being.
If the fountain were not full, it would dry up.
If ten thousand creatures did not come to life, they would perish.
If kings and princes were not supreme, they would stumble and fall.
Hence, humility is the root of greatness.
The high is built upon the foundation of the low.
That is why kings and princes style themselves "the solitary one," "the little one," and "the worthless one".
Is this not enough to prove that humility serves as root?
Therefore extreme honor means no honor.
Do not wish to shine like jade and be aloof like stone.
