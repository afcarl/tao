Great Virtue shows itself only in following the Way.
The Way is something elusive and evasive.
Elusive and evasive, and yet it contains within itself an image.
Elusive and evasive, and yet it contains within itself a substance.
Unfathomable and hidden, and yet it contains within itself an essence.
The essence is very real, and contains within itself an unfailing sincerity.
Throughout the ages its name has been preserved because through it we see the beginning of all things.
How do I know the beginning of all things?
Through it.
