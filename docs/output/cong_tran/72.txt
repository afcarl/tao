When the people no longer fear power, it is a sign that a great power is coming.
Do not constrict their dwelling, nor lay heavy burdens upon their life.
Only when you do not weary them, they will not be wearied of you.
Therefore, the sage knows himself, but makes no show of himself; loves himself, but does not exalt himself.
He prefers what is within to what is without.
