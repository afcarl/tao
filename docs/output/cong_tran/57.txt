You govern a state by straightness.
You engage in war by rare operations.
It is by non-doing that you win the world.
How do I know that this is so?
By the fact it is so.
The more restrictions and inhibitions there are in the world, the poorer the people become.
The sharper the weapons the people possess, the more disordered the nation is.
The more skills the people have, the more strange things happen.
The more articulate the laws and rules, the more thieves and robbers there are.
Therefore, the sage says:
I do not do, and the people transform themselves.
I love quietude, and the people become straight by themselves.
I do not engage myself in anything, and the people grow rich by themselves.
I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.
