Do not exalt the talented, and the people cease from rivalry and contention.
Do not prize goods hard to get, and the people cease from robbing and stealing.
Do not display what is desirable, and the people's hearts remain undisturbed.
Therefore, the sage's way of governing is: emptying the mind, filling the belly, weakening the will, toughening the bones.
In this way he will cause the people to remain without knowledge and without desire, and prevent the knowing ones from any doing.
Doing "non-doing", and everything will be in order.
