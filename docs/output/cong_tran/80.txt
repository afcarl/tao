[Suppose] there is (we establish) a small country with a small population.
Therefore there are enough tools of war for a troop or a battalion, but the people have no use for them.
So the people mind death and refrain from migrating to distant places.
Even though there are boats and carriages, they do not ride them; even though there are weapons and armor, they do not carry and wear them.
The people return to the use of the knotting cords.
They find relish with their food, beauty with their clothing, peace with their houses, and merriment with their ways of living.
There is another country in the neighborhood.
The two countries are so close that they are within sight of each other and the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs in one place can be heard in the other.
Yet throughout their lives the two peoples do not travel to and fro.
