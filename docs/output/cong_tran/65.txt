In the old days, those who were well versed in the practice of the Way did not try to make the people know, but rather to keep them in the state of simplicity.

Because they are clever.

He who governs his state without resorting to cleverness is its benefactor.
To know these two principles is to possess a rule and a measure of governing.
To know the rule and the measure is mysterious Virtue.
Deep and far-reaching is mysterious Virtue!
It leads all things to return to great harmony.
