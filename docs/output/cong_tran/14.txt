Look at it but you cannot see it; its name is formless.
Listen to it but you cannot hear it; its name is soundless.
Grasp it but you cannot get it; its name is incorporeal.
These three attributes are unfathomable; therefore they mingle into one.
Its upper side is not bright; its under side not dim.
It continues endlessly, it is unnamable.
Until it returns beyond the realm of things, it is called the formless form, the non-material image; it is called the vague.
Confront it and you do not see its face!
Follow it and you do not see its back!
He who keeps with this timeless Way can dominate present events.
To know the timeless origin is to go into the Way.
