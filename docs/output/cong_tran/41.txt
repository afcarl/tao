When a man of high learning hears the Way, he diligently practices it.
When a man of ordinary learning hears the Way, he seems to remember it and not to remember it.
When a man of little learning hears the Way, he laughs loud.
If this man did not laugh, the Way would not be enough to be the Way.
Hence, the men of old have truly said:
"The Way that is bright seems dull.
The Way that advances seems to move backward.
The Way that is smooth seems rugged.
High Virtue seems like an abyss.
Great whiteness seems spotted.
Abundant Virtue seems deficient.
Rigorous Virtue seems shabby.
Real essence seems empty.
Great squareness has no corners.
Great vessel takes long to complete.
Great voice has no sound.
The great image is formless."
The Way is hidden and nameless.
Yet it alone knows how to render help and to fulfill.
