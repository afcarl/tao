One on tip-toe cannot stand.
One astride cannot walk.
One who displays himself does not shine.
One who justifies himself has no glory.
One who boasts of his own work has no merit.
One who is proud of himself will not endure.
From the point of view of the Way, these things are called "unwanted food and extraneous growths," which are loathed by all things.
Hence, a man of the Way does not set his heart upon them.
