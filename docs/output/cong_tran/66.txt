How do the river and the sea become the king of all streams?
Because they place themselves in low positions, they are the kings of all streams.
Therefore, to reign over the people, one must use humble words.
To wish to stand in front of the people, one must put oneself in back of them.
Therefore the sage is above the people, and they do not feel the heaviness of his weight; he stands in front of them, they do not feel hurt.
Therefore all the world is glad to adore him without getting tired of him.
Just because he contends with nobody, nobody contends with him.
