The great Way is all-pervading, it can reach the right or the left.
All things depend on it, and none is excluded.
It does its work, but it makes no claims for itself.
It clothes and feeds all things, but it makes no claims to be their master.
Because it does not have desire, it may be called "the little."
All things return to it as to their home, but it does not lord over them: Thus, it may be called "the great."
It is just because it does not attempt to be great that its greatness is fully realized.
