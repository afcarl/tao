He who knows men is intelligent.
He who knows himself has insight.
He who conquers men is strong.
He who conquers himself is vigorous.
He who knows how to be enough is rich.
He who goes on assiduously is a man of steady will.
He who does not lose his dwelling endures long.
He who dies but perishes not has a long life.
