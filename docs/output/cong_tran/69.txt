The strategists have a saying: I dare not be a host, but rather a guest; I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.
This is called going without marching, rolling up one's sleeves without baring one's arms, capturing the enemy without confronting him, holding a weapon that is invisible.
There is no greater calamity than to underestimate the enemy.
To underestimate the enemy is to lose your treasure.
Therefore, when opposing troops meet in battle, victory belongs to the grieving side.
