The Way does not do, but does do (does not do nothing).
If kings and princes can cling to it, all things will change by themselves.
When they change and tend to stir, it is time to keep them in their place by the aid of the nameless uncarved.
It is the uncarved that curbs the desires.
Without desires, there will be stillness; the world will be in peace by itself.
