If only I had a slight wisdom, I should walk in the great Way, and my only fear would be to stray from it.
The great Way is very smooth and straight; and yet the people prefer circuitous paths.
Nowadays people like circuitous paths, even though these paths bring many evil crimes.
The court is extremely elegant; but the fields are extremely weedy and wild, and the granaries are extremely empty.
They wear gorgeous clothes, they carry sharp swords, they surfeit themselves with food and drink, they possess more riches than they can use.
This is boastful robbery.
And it is indeed against the Way.
