One who is enriched with Virtue is like the new-born babe.
Wasps and poisonous serpents do not sting him.
Nor fierce beasts seize him, nor birds of prey maul him.
His bones are tender, his sinews soft, but his grip is firm.
He has not known the union of the male and the female, but he grows in his wholeness, and his spirit is at its highest point.
He screams all day long without getting hoarse, because he embodies supreme harmony.
To know harmony is to be constant.
To know the constant is to have insight.
To hasten life is harmful.
To use the belly to direct the ether is to suppress it.
Things become big, thus they will be old soon.
That is against the Way.
To be against the Way is to die soon.
