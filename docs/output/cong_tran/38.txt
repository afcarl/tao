The man of high virtue does not do and has nothing to do.
The man of low virtue does and has something to do.
The man of high benevolence does, and has nothing to do.
The man of high righteousness does, and has something to do.

Propriety is the merest husk of faith and loyalty, and the beginning of disorder.

Hence, he drops what is without and keeps what is within.
