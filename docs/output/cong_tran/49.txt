The sage has no heart of his own, but takes the heart of the people as his own.
He is good to the good; he is also good to the not-good: for Virtue is good.
He is faithful to the faithful; he is also faithful to the unfaithful: for Virtue is faithful.
In the midst of the world, the sage recoils.
For the sake of the world he keeps his heart nebulous.
All the people strain their ears and eyes: he treats them as innocent children.
