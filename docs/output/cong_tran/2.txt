When the entire world recognizes beauty as beauty, there is ugliness.
When the entire world recognizes good as good, there is evil.
Indeed, "nothing" and "being" give birth to each other.
Difficult and easy complement each other.
Long and short exhibit each other.
High and low set measure to each other.
Voice and sound harmonize each other.
Back and front follow each other.
Therefore, the sage manages his affairs by "non-doing", and spreads his teaching by "non-talking".
The Way makes all things and denies nothing; it gives birth to them, but lays no claim to them; it does its work, but does not say by its work; it accomplishes his work, but does not dwell on things.
And yet it is just because he does not dwell on things that nobody can ever take them away from it.
