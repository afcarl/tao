The Way is like an empty bowl, which is never used up.
Fathomless, it seems to be the origin of all things.
It blunts all sharp edges; it unties all tangles; it harmonizes all lights; it unites the worldly dusts.
Hidden in the deeps, yet it seems to exist forever.
I do not know whose child it is; it seems to be the common ancestor of all, the father of things.
