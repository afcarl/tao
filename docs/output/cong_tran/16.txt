Attain to utmost emptiness.
Cling single-heartedly to stillness.
While all things are stirring together, I only contemplate the return; all things flourish, but each of them will return to its root.
To return to the root is to be still; that is to return to one's destiny.
To return to one's destiny is to return to the constant Way.
To know the constant Way is called enlightenment.
If one does not know the constant Way, one is blind and runs into disasters.
If one knows the constant Way, one is all-embracing.
If one is all-embracing, one is just.
To be just is to be king.
King is Heaven.
Heaven is the Way.
The Way is eternal.
It is safe all life.
