In order to shrink it, it must first be stretched out.
In order to weaken it, it must first be made strong.
In order to throw down it, it must first be set on high.
In order to obtain it, it must first be given.
That is subtle and wise.
The soft overcomes the hard.
The weak overcomes the strong.
The fish cannot leave the deep.
The useful instruments of the nation must not be displayed to the people.
