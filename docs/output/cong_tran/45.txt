The greatest perfection seems imperfect; yet its use is inexhaustible.
The greatest fullness seems empty; yet its use is endless.
The greatest straightness seems bent.
The greatest skill appears clumsy.
The greatest eloquence seems stammering.
Active overcomes cold.
Calmness overcomes heat.
Tranquillity is the norm of the world.
