There was something chaotic and yet complete in itself, born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and empty, standing alone and unchanging, pervading everywhere and inexhaustible, it may be regarded as the mother of the world.
I do not know its name, so I simply call it "the Way".
I reluctantly call it "the great."
To be great is to go on.
To go on is to go far.
To go far is to return.
Hence, "The Way is great. Heaven is great. Earth is great. Man is great." Thus, man is one of the great four in the universe.
Man follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Way, the Way follows Nature.
