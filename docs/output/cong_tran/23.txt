Few words fit Nature.
For a whirlwind does not last a whole morning, nor does a sudden shower last a whole day.
Who is their author?
Heaven and earth.
Even Heaven and earth cannot make their things last long; how is it possible for the works of men?
Hence, he who cultivates the Way is one with the Way; he who practices Virtue is one with Virtue; and he who loses the Way is one with Loss.
To be one with the Way: the Way welcomes it.
To be one with Virtue: Virtue welcomes it.
To be one with Loss: Loss welcomes it.
If it is not enough to get faith, there is no faith.
