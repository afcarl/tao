The Way is the shelter of all things, the treasure of the good, and the refuge of the bad.
A beautiful word may bring admiration.
A precious deed may bring a high rank.
That a man is not good is not a reason that he should be cast away.
Hence, at the enthronement of an emperor, or at the appointment of the three ministers, the offering of jade and four-horsed carriages is not as good as the kneeling presentation of the Way.
Why did the ancients prize the Way?
Is it not because they said that "by virtue of it he who seeks finds, and the guilty are forgiven"?
That is why it is such a treasure to the world.
