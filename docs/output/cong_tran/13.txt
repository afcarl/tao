"Welcome disgrace as a fright. Prize calamities as your own body."
Why do we say "welcome disgrace as a fright"?
Welcome denotes "in the low place": Getting "welcome" is a fright, and so is losing it!
That is why we say "welcome disgrace as a fright".
Why do we say "prize calamity as your own self"?
Because our self is the very source of our calamity.
If we have no self, what calamities can we have?
Hence, only he who is willing to give his self for the sake of the world is fit to be entrusted with the world.
Only he who can love to give his self for the sake of the world is worthy of being the steward of the world.
