All the world says that my Way is great, but seems queer, like nothing on earth.
But it is just because my Way is great that it is like nothing on earth.
If it were like anything on earth, it would have been small from the very beginning.
I have three treasures, which I hold fast and watch over closely.
The first is compassion; the second is frugality; the third is not daring to be first in the world.
Being compassionate, I can be brave; being frugal, I can be generous; daring not be first, I can be the chief.
If a man forsakes compassion for courage, forsakes frugality for expansiveness, forsakes the rear position for front position, he is only courting death!
Compassionate to engage in war, one wins; in defense, one is secure.
When Heaven wants to help a man, it takes compassion to protect him.
