In ancient times the wise men of the Way were subtle, divine, comprehensive and too profound to be known.
Because they are unfathomable, we try to describe their picture as following:
Hesitant like one crossing a stream in winter.
Timid like one afraid of his neighbors on all sides.
Serious like a guest.
Thawing like ice on the point of melting.
Simple like an uncarved block.
Hollow like a cave.
Muddled like muddy water.
Who knows he is muddled and settles down, then quietly and gradually becomes clear?
Who knows to move from inertia and gradually become living?
He who keeps the Way does not want to be full.
Precisely because he is never full, he can always remain hidden, and does not become new.
