The world has its root.
This root is the mother of the world.
If you know the mother, you know her children.
If you know the children, you should go back and hold on to the mother.
In so doing, to the end of your days you will incur no risk.
Block all the passages, shut all the doors: to the end of your days you will not be worn out.
Open the passages, multiply your activities: to the end of your days you will remain helpless.
To see the small is to have insight.
To hold on to weakness is to be strong.
To use the lights, to return to insight, not to bring calamities upon oneself, this is the way of cultivating the constant.
