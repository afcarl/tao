My words are very easy to understand, and very easy to practice.
But the world cannot understand them, nor practice them.
My words have a root.
My deeds have a lord.
Because people are not aware of this, they do not understand me.
Those who understand me are few, those who follow me are honored.
Therefore, the sage wears coarse clothes, while keeping the jade in his bosom.
