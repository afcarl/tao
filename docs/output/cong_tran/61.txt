A great country is like the low stream.
It is where the world flows together.
It is the feminine of the world.
The feminine always conquers the masculine by her quietness; she is in a lower place by her quietness.
Hence, if a big state is below a small state, it will win over the small state.
If a small is below a big state, it will win over the big state.
The one wins by lowering itself; the other, by remaining low.
What a great state wants is simply to embrace and protect more people.
What a small country wants is simply to participate and to submit its patron.
Thus, each gets what it wants.
But it behooves a big state to lower itself.
