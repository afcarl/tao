When a man is living, he is soft and supple.
When he is dead, he becomes hard and rigid.
When a plant is living, it is soft and tender.
When it is dead, it becomes withered and dry.
Hence, the hard and rigid belongs to the company of the dead; the soft and supple belongs to the company of the living.
Therefore, a mighty army will not win, just as hard tree is ready for the axe.
The mighty and great are below; the soft and weak are above.
