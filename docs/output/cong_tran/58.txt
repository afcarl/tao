Where the government is dull, the people are simple.
Where the government is sharp, the people are deceitful.
Bad fortune is what good fortune leans on.
Good fortune is what bad fortune hides in.
Who knows the ultimate end of bad fortune and good fortune?
Is there the right?
The right changes into the strange.
The good changes into the monstrous.
Long indeed have the people been ignorant.
Therefore, the sage squares without cutting, sharpens without disfiguring, straightens without straining, enlightens without dazzling.
