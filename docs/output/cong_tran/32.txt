The Way is always nameless.
Small as it is in its uncarved block, it is inferior to nothing in the world.
If only a king or a prince could abide with it, all things in the world will render homage to him.
Heaven and Earth are in harmony and send down sweet dew.
Without being commanded to do so, the people live in peace and order.
When the original diversifies, different names arise.
When names arise, one should know it is time to stop.
To know when to stop is to be free from danger.
The Way is to the world what a great river or an ocean is to the streams and brooks.
