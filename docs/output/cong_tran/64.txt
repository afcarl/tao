What is still is easy to keep.
What does not manifest yet is easy to deal with.
What is fragile is easily broken.
What is small is easily scattered.
Deal with a thing before it occurs.
Repair a thing before it is in disorder.
A tree as big as a man's embrace springs from a tiny sprout.
A nine story tower begins with a basket of earth.
A journey of a thousand miles starts from where one stands.
To do is to fail.
To grip is to lose.
Therefore the sage does not do and so does not fail, does not grip and so does not lose.
In handling affairs, people often fail just at the point of completion.
Be as careful at the end as at the beginning, then there will be no failure.
Therefore, the sage desires no-desire, does not prize rare goods, learns non-learning, helps the masses return from their ignorance.
He wants to help all creatures to live by their own nature, and does not interfere with them.
