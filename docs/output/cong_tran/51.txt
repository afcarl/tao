The Way gives birth [to all things]; Virtue nourishes; matter shapes; environment perfects.
Therefore all things without exception revere the Way and honor Virtue, although they are not commanded, but left to do so naturally.
Hence, the Way gives birth; Virtue nurses, grows, fosters, shelters, comforts, nourishes, and guards.
It gives birth but does not claim as its own; it does but does not claim its doing; it grows but does not claim to be master.
This is called hidden Virtue.
