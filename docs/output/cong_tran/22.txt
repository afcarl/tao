Bent but then whole.
Curled but then straight.
Empty but then full.
Worn but then new.
Little but then gain.
Much but then doubtful.
Therefore, the sage embraces the One, and becomes an example for the world.
He does not make a show of himself, hence he shines.
He does not justify himself, hence he becomes known.
He does not boast of his ability, hence he gets his credit.
He does not brandish his success, hence he endures.
He does not compete with anyone, hence no one can compete with him.
Indeed, the ancient saying "Bent but then whole" is not an empty word.
If you have really attained wholeness, everyone will flock to you.
