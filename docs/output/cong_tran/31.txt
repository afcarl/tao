Good weapons are instruments of evil.
Even things seem to hate them.
Therefore the man of the Way does not set his heart upon them.
A superior man prefers the left side when at home, prefers the right side when in war.
Weapons are instruments of evil.
They are not the instruments of the superior man.
He uses them when he has no choice.
He prefers peace and quiet.
To him victory is not beautiful.
To glorify a victory is to rejoice over killing men.
If one rejoices over killing men, one will not conquer the will of the world.
Many people have been killed, one should weep over them with sorrow.
A victory is also a funeral.
