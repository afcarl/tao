In governing a people and in serving Heaven, there is nothing like frugality.
To be frugal is to return early.
To return early is to accumulate an abundance of Virtue.
Accumulating an abundance of Virtue, everything can be overcome.
Overcoming everything, the unknown height is reached.
He who has reached an unknown height can reign a state.
He who reigns a state from its root can last long.
This is the Way of the deep root and the firm foot, of the of long life and not-getting-old.
