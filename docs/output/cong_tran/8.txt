The man of the highest goodness is like water.
Water knows how to benefit all things without striving with them.
It stays in places loathed by all men.
Therefore, it comes near the Way.
In choosing your dwelling, know how to keep to the earth.
In cultivating your mind, know how to dive in the abyss.
In dealing with others, know how to be in relation to benevolence.
In speaking, know how to keep faithfulness.
In controlling the affairs of the state, know how to maintain good governing.
In working, know how to be suitable to ability.
In acting, know how to be suitable to time.
If you do not strive with others, you will be free from error.
