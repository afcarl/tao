Drop sagacity, abandon intellection, and the people will be benefited a hundredfold.
Drop benevolence, abandon righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and paternal kindness.
Drop shrewdness, abandon profit, and robbers and thieves will cease to be.
These three, being external adornments, are not enough.
Therefore, there must have something to which the people attach themselves: see the pure, embrace the unadorned, diminish the self and curb the desires.
