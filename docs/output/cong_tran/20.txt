Give up learning, and you will have no more worry.
How great is the difference between "yes" and "no"?
What is the distinction between "good" and "evil"?
Must I fear what others fear?
What abysmal nonsense this is!
All men are joyous and beaming, as though feasting upon a sacrificial ox, as though mounting a spring terrace.
I alone am placid and get no mark, like a babe that has not yet smiled.
I alone am forlorn as one who has no home to return to.
All men have more than enough.
I alone appear to possess nothing.
What a fool I am!
What an obscure mind I have!
All men are shining.
I alone am dull.
All men are sharp.
I alone am blunt, riffling like the endless ocean, rambling like the ceaseless wind.
All men have their things.
I alone am stubborn and stupid.
But wherein I am most different from others is in knowing to prize my nourishing mother.
