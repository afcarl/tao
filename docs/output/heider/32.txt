Tao cannot be defined. One can only say that it is the single principle responsible for every event or thing.
When the leader has regard for this principle, and for no lesser theories, the group members trust the leader. Because the leader pays equal attention to everything that happens, there are no prejudices to divide the group into faction. There is unity.
Because the group work is grounded in an obvious and natural righteousness, rules and regulations are not needed to make people behave.
Even though the single principle cannot be defined, it is possible to explain what is happening in a group. We speak of gestalt formation, of polarities, of flows and blocks, of interventions that either hinder or facilitate, and so on.
But too much theoretical talk distracts the group from what is happening, from the process itself. Talking about process is one way to block process and lower the energy of the group field.
When that happens, the wise leader returns once again to an awareness of what is happening and to the single principle that lies behind what is happening.
In the long run, focusing on this single principle is the most potent aspect of leadership. From this unity, we learn how things happen.
