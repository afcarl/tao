Gentle interventions, if they are clear, overcome rigid resistances.
If gentleness fails, try yielding or stepping back altogether. When the leader yields, resistances relax.
Generally speaking, the leader's consciousness sheds more light on what is happening than any number of interventions or explanations.
Few leaders realize how much how little will do.
