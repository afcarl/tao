Can you learn to become open and receptive, quiet and without desires or the need to do something? Being open and receptive is called Yin, the feminine, or the valley.
Imagine that there is a pond in this valley. When no fears or desires stir the surface of the pond, the water forms a perfect mirror.
In this mirror, you can see the reflection of Tao. You can see God and you can see creation.
Go into the valley, be still, and watch the pond. Go as often as you wish. Your silence will grow. The pond will never run dry.
The valley, the pond, and Tao are all within you.
