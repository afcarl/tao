The wise leader knows that the true nature of events cannot be captured in words. So why pretend?
Confusing jargon is one sure sign of a leader who does not know how things happen.
But what cannot be said can be demonstrated: be silent, be conscious. Consciousness works. It sheds light on what in happening. It clarifies conflicts and harmonizes the agitated individual or group field.
The leader also knows that all existence is a single whole. Therefore, the leader is a neutral observer who takes no sides.
The leader cannot be seduced by offers or threats. Money, love, or fame - whether gained or lost - do not sway the leader from center.
The leader's integrity is not idealistic. It rests on a pragmatic knowledge of how things work.
