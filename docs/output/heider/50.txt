Existence consists of both life and death. Favouring either life or death denies existence and creates tension. Tension causes people to make mistakes in critical situations. Mistakes are far more deadly than existence itself.
Thirty percent of the people love life and fear death.
Another thirty percent prefer death and avoid life.
Another thirty percent fear both life and death.
Ninety percent of the people suffer the tension that comes from the tension that comes from ignorance of how polarities work. Even though life and death are opposites, they are inseparable. Preferences are futile.
Only ten percent have the wisdom to accept both life and death as facts and simply enjoy the dance of existence. After all, growth and decay are everywhere, all the time.
The wise leader knows that everything comes and goes. So why grasp or cling? Why worry or cringe? Why live in a fantasy of what might happen?
The ferocious dog bites the excited person. The conscious and centered person walks by unharmed.
The wise leader exists without either loving death or fearing death. This freedom keeps the leader safe from harm.
