Our job is to facilitate process and clarify conflicts. This ability depends less on formal education than on common sense and traditional wisdom.
The highly educated leader tends to respond in terms of one theoretical model or another. It is better simply to respond directly to what is happening here and now.
Make sure that any model you do have is compatible with traditional wisdom; admire the wise of all religions.
For example, most people act in order to fill their desires. They believe that the world serves them. But the wise leader serves others and is relatively desireless, even defenseless.
Most people are plagued by endless needs, but the wise leader is content with relatively little. Most people lead busy lives, but the wise leader is quiet and reflective. Most people seek stimulation and novelty, but the wise leader refers what is common and natural.
Being content permits simplicity in life. What is common is universal. What is natural is close to the source of creation.
This is traditional wisdom.
