The wise leader, learning how things happen, lives accordingly.
The average leader also learns how things happen, but vacillates, now acting accordingly and then forgetting.
The worst leaders learn how things happen and dismiss the single principle as total nonsense. How else could their work be so futile?
After all, they say, any principle that does not get you love or money or power must be useless. A silent mind is a dumb mind. Selflessness is no way to get ahead. Virtue is for fools. Kindness is weakness. And so on.
This is a problem: because the wise leader's only allegiance is to how things happen, people who do not see how things happen naturally think that the wise leader's behaviour has no basis in reality. Also, the leader's silence and manner of being are disturbing. Because the leader's motives are obscure, the leader is hard to figure out.
The problem comes back to the fact that the principle is not a thing and cannot be defined. That does not make sense to some people.
It is not easy to understand a person whose foundation is invisible.
