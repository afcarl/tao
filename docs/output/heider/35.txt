Do not get carried away by the group process.
Stick to the single principle. Then you can do good work, stay free from chaos and conflicts, and feel present in all situations.
The superficial leader cannot see how things happen, even though the evidence is everywhere. This leader is swept up by drama, sensation, and excitement. All this confusion is blinding.
But the leader who returns again and again to awareness-of-process has a deep sense of how things happen. This leader has a simple time of it. The sessions flow smoothly, and when the group ends, the leader is still in good spirits.
