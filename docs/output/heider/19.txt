Forget those clever techniques and self-improvement programs, and everyone will be better off.
Do not promise to cure people, to make people feel good, to make life sane or fair or humane. Do not offer programs that appeal to selfishness, programs that teach how to be rich, powerful, sexy - and greedy, paranoid, an manipulative.
No teacher can make you be happy, prosperous, healthy, or powerful. No rules or techniques can enforce these qualities.
If you wish to improve yourself, try silence or some other cleansing discipline that will gradually show you your true selfless self.
