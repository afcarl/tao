The leader who is centered and grounded can work with erratic people and critical group situations without harm.
Being centered means having the ability to recover one's balance, even in the midst of action. A centered person is not subject to passing whims or sudden excitements.
Being grounded means being down-to-earth, having gravity or weight. I know where I stand, and I know what I stand for: that is ground.
The centered and grounded leader has stability and a sense of self.
One who is not stable can easily get carried away by the intensity of leadership and make mistakes of judgement or even become ill.
