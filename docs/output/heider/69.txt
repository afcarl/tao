If a group member wants to fight with you, consider the strategy of the guerrilla commander: Never seek a fight. If it comes to you, yield; step back. It is far better to step back than to overstep yourself.
Your strength is good intelligence: be aware of what is happening. Your weapon is not a weapon at all. It is the light of consciousness.
Advance only where you encounter no resistance. If you make a point, do not cling to it. If you win, be gracious.
The person who initiates the attack is off center and easily thrown. Even so, have respect for any attacker. Never surrender your compassion or use your skill to harm another needlessly.
In any event, the more conscious force will win.
