When you cannot see what is happening in a group, do not stare harder. Relax and look with your inner eye.
When you do not understand what a person is saying, do not grasp for every word. Give up your efforts. Become silent inside and listen with your deepest self.
When you are puzzled by what you see or hear, push less, open out and be aware. See without staring. Listen quietly rather than listening hard. Use intuition and reflection rather than trying to figure things out.
The more you can let go of trying, and the more open and receptive you become, the more easily you will know what is happening.
Also, stay in the present. The present is more available than either memories of the past or fantasies of the future.
So attend to what is happening now.
