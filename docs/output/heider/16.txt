To become more profound, give up your selfishness. Let go of your efforts to be perfect or rich or secure or admired. Such efforts only limit you. They block your universality.
Letting go is like dying. Everything emerges, becomes formed, and dies. You, too.
When you die, you give up selfishness. You become one with everything else.
My deeper self knows that I am one with everything else anyway. All creation is a single whole which works according to a single principle.
I let my selfishness go and give up the illusion of being separate. I act in behalf of the whole. I benefit me and I benefit you. I am at odds with no one. I am at peace, and have energy to spare, because I am not resisting what is happening.
Death is not frightening, because I know how to let go, and I know the nature of the Eternal.
