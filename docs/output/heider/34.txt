The single principle can be found everywhere, all the time. Everything works according to it. Every life unfolds according to it. The single principle does not say yes to this and no to that.
Even though Tao is the source of all growth and development, nothing profits Tao. Tao benefits all without return and without prejudice.
Neither is the single principle private property. You cannot own it. It does not own you.
Its greatness lies in its universality. It is all inclusive.
The wise leader follows this principle and does not act selfishly. The leader does not accept one person and refuse to work with another. The leader does not own people or control their lives. Leadership is not a matter of winning.
The work done in order to shed the light of awareness on whatever is happening: also, selfless service, without prejudice, available to all.
