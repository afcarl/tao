The group will not prosper if the leader grabs the lion's share of the credit for the good work that has been done.
The group will rebel and resist if the leader relies on strict controls in an effort to make things come out a certain way.
The group members will become deadened and unresponsive if the leader is critical and harsh.
The wise leader is not greedy, selfish, defensive, or demanding. That is why the leader can be trusted to allow any event to unfold naturally.
