If you want to be free, learn to live simply.
Use what you have and be content where you are. Quit trying to solve your problems by moving to another place, by changing mates or careers.
Leave your car in the garage. If you have a gun, put it away. Sell that complex computer and go back to using pencil and paper. Rather than read every new book that comes along, reread the classics.
Eat food grown locally. Wear simple, durable clothing. Keep a small home, uncluttered and easy to clean. Keep an open calendar with periods of uncommitted time. Have a spiritual practice and let family customs grow.
Of course, the world is full of novelty and adventures. New opportunities come along every day.
So what?
