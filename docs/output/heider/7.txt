True self-interest teaches selflessness.
Heaven and earth endure because they are not simply selfish but exist in behalf of all creation.
The wise leader, knowing this, keeps egocentricity in check and by doing so becomes even more effective.
Enlightened leadership is service, not selfishness. The leader grows more and lasts longer by placing the well-being of all above the well-being of self alone.
Paradox: By being selfless, the leader enhances self.
