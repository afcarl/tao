The wise leader does not impose a personal agenda or value system on the group.
The leader follows the group's lead and is open to whatever emerges. The leader judges no one and is attentive to both 'good' and 'bad' people. It does not even matter whether a person is telling the truth or lying.
Being open and attentive is more effective than being judgmental. This is because people naturally tend to be good and truthful when they are being received in a good and truthful manner.
Perhaps the leader seems na√Øve and childlike in this uncritical openness to whatever emerges. But openness is simply more potent than any system of judgements ever devised.
