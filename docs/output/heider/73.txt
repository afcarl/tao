Imagine that there are two kinds of courage. One is an active courage that gets people killed. The other is an inner courage that keeps people alive. Which of these two is better?
No one can answer that for you. Each has its benefits and its drawbacks. Tao has no preferences.
Keeping in mind that Tao means how: how things happen. But how-things-happen is not the same as what-should-I-do. No one can tell you what to do. That is your freedom. That is your responsibility.
Instead of asking for advice, learn to become more conscious of what is actually happening. Then you will be able to see for yourself how things happen. You can make your own decisions about what to do.
Tao does not preach sermons or dictate behaviour. What people do is their own responsibility. But the pattern of their behaviour follows natural law.
This law is so general, it covers every possible event. It is so specific, it applies to every instance of every event.
But no one can decide for you what to do in a given situation. That is up to you.
