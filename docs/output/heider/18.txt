Do not lose sight of the single principle: how everything works.
When this principle is lost and the method of meditating on process fails, the group becomes mired in intellectual discussion of what could have happened, what should have happened, what this technique or that might do. Soon the group will become quarrelsome and depressed.
Once you leave the path of simple consciousness, you enter the labyrinth of cleverness, competition, and imitation.
When a lesser person forgets that all creation is a unity, allegiance goes to lesser wholes such as the family, the home team, or the company.
Nationalism, racism, classism, sexism: all arise as consciousness of unity is lost. People take sides and favour this versus that.
