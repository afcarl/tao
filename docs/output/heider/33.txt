To know how other people behave takes intelligence, but to know myself takes wisdom.
To manage other people's lives takes strength, but to manage my own life takes true power.
If I am content with what I have, I can live simply and enjoy both prosperity and free time.
If my goals are clear, I can achieve them without fuss.
If I am at peace with myself, I will not spend my life force in conflicts.
If I have learned to let go, I do not need to fear dying.
