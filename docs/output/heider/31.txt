There are times when it seems as if one must intervene powerfully, suddenly, and even harshly. The wise leader does this only when all else fails.
As a rule, the leader feels more wholesome when the group process if flowing freely and unfolding naturally, when delicate facilitations far outnumber harsh interventions.
Harsh interventions are a warning that the leader may be uncentered or have an emotional attachment to whatever is happening. A special awareness is called for.
Even if harsh interventions succeed brilliantly, there is no cause for celebration. There has been injury. Someone's process has been violated.
Later on, the person whose process has been violated may well become less open and more defended. There will be a deeper resistance and possibly even resentment.
Making people do what you think they ought to be do does not lead toward clarity and consciousness. While the may do what you tell them to do at the time, they will cringe inwardly, grow confused, and plot revenge.
That is why your victory is actually a failure.
