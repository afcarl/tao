All power and effectiveness come from following the law of creation. There is no substitute for knowing how things happen and for acting accordingly.
Everything, like it or not, is bounded by this principle. The principle is like the blueprint for everything.
All power derives from conscious or unconscious cooperation with the principle.
The single principle is manifest everywhere, all the time.
All birth and growth and death that ever happened, or is happening today, or will happen in the future behaves according to this one rule of existence.
To be sure, new forms do emerge with the passage of time, but they still conform to the same old principle.
How do I know that Tao is universal?
I cannot answer that rationally. I know it from being silent. I know it by virtue of God.
