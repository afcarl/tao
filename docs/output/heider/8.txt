The wise leader is like water.
Consider water: water cleanses and refreshes all creatures without distinction and without judgement; water freely and fearlessly goes deep beneath the surface of things; water is fluid and responsive; water follows the law freely.
Consider the leader: the leader works in any setting without complaint, with any person or issue that comes on the floor; the leader acts so that all will benefit and serves well regardless of the rate of pay; the leader speaks simply and honestly and intervenes in order to shed light and create harmony.
From watching the movements of water, the leader has learned that in action, timing is everything.
Like water, the leader is yielding. Because the leader does not push, the group does not resent or resist.
