Natural law is blind, its justice evenhanded. The consequences of one's behaviour are inescapable. Being human is no excuse.
The wise leader does not try to protect people from themselves. The light of awareness shines equally on what is pleasant and what is not pleasant.
People are not better than the rest of creation. The same principle which underlies human beings underlies everything equally.
Neither is one person or one people better than the rest of humanity. The same principle is everywhere. One person is as worthy of the next. Why play favourites?
Everything demonstrates the law. Just because God is not a thing does not mean God is nothing. A little humility is in order.
Knowing this, the leader does not pretend to be special. The leader does not gossip about others or waste breath arguing the merits of competing theories.
Silence is a great source of strength.
