Pay attention to silence. What is happening when nothing is happening in a group? That is the group field.
Thirteen people sit in a circle, but it is climate or the spirit in the center of the circle, where nothing is happening, that determines the nature of the group field.
Learn to see emptiness. When you enter an empty house, can you feel the mood of the place? It is the same with a vase or a pot; learn to see the emptiness inside; which is the usefulness of it.
People's speech and actions are figural events. They give the group form and content.
The silences and empty spaces, on the other hand, reveal the group's essential mood, the context for everything that happens. That is the group field.
