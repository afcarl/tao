The wise leader speaks rarely and briefly. After all, no other natural outpouring goes on and on. It rains and then it stops. It thunders and then it stops.
The leader teaches more through being than through doing. The quality of one's silence conveys more than long speeches.
Be still. Follow your inner wisdom. In order to know your inner wisdom, you have to be still.
The leader who knows how to be still and feel deeply will probably be effective. Bu the leader who chatters and boasts and tries to impress the group has no center and carries little weight.
Tao works for those who follow Tao. God serves those who serve God. When you are in touch with the single principle, your actions will be effective. But if you are simply being egocentric, or if you are just trying to be dramatic, you will neither do good nor look good.
Remember that the method is awareness-of-process. Reflect. Be still.
What do you deeply feel?
