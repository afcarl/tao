The greatest martial arts are the gentlest. They allow an attacker the opportunity to fall down.
The greatest generals do not rush into every battle. They offer the enemy many opportunities to make self-defeating errors.
The greatest administrators do not achieve production through constraints and limitations. They provide opportunities.
Good leadership consists of motivating people to their highest levels by offering them opportunities, not obligations.
That is how things happen naturally. Life is an opportunity and not an obligation.
