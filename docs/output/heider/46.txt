The well-run group is not a battlefield of egos. Of course there will be conflict, but these energies become creative forces.
If the leader loses sight of how thing happen, quarrels and fear devastate the group field.
This is a matter of attitude. There is nothing to win or lose in group work. Making a point does not shed light on what is happening. Wanting to be right blinds people.
The wise leader knows that it is far more important to be content with what is actually happening than to get upset over what might be happening but isn't.
