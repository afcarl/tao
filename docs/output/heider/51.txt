Everything, every behaviour, is a vibratory pattern or process. Such process emerges, develops, and decays, according to the single principle.
People have a natural reverence for the principle, and they naturally love the vibratory energy which obeys the principle.
The vibratory energy and the principle make a partnership, which produces an infinite variety of forms. But the partnership takes no profit from its productivity. Neither does it get its power by making things happen in a coercive manner. There are simply no alternatives; there is no other way.
This partnership between principle and process is the first fact of life and of our work.
