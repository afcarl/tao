A good group is better than a spectacular group. When leaders become superstars, the teacher outshines the teaching.
Very few superstars are down-to-earth. Fame breeds fame, and before long the get carried away with themselves. Then they fly off center and crash.
The wise leader settles for good work and then lets others have the floor. The leader does not take credit for what happens and has no need for fame.
A moderate ego demonstrates wisdom.
