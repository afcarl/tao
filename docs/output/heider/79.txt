If you get into an argument with a group member, and it does not come out the way you wish it would, do not pretend to compromise while withholding your true feelings.
Yield your position gracefully. Return to facilitating what is happening.
It is not your business to be right or to win arguments. It is not your business to find the flaws in the other person's position. It is not your business to feel belittled if the other person wins.
It is your business to facilitate whatever is happening, win or lose.
Because we are all one, there are no sides to take. When all is said and done, the wise leader goes along with what is happening anyway.
