The best work often seems idiotically simple to group members who are unaccustomed to this sort of leadership. Yet a great deal happens.
Perhaps it looks as if the leader is only sitting there and has no idea of what to do. But it is just this lack of needless intervention that permits the group to grow and be fertile.
Perhaps some disappointed group members expected an expert who would expound freely. But what this leader says is so obvious, it often sounds simple-minded. Even this leader's honesty seems strangely perplexing.
Appearing foolish does not matter. When you are cold, flap your arms about to get warm. But when you are overheated, you keep still. That is common sense.
The leader's stillness overcomes the group's agitation. The leader's consciousness is the primary tool of this work.
