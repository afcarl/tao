When humankind strayed from the natural way of life,
relative social disciplines began to appear.
When intelligence and cleverness of mind are admired,
great hypocrisy is born.
When disharmony manifested in family relations,
children who respected their parents and parents who loved their children became rare examples.
When chaos prevailed in the country,
only a few loyal ministers were recognized.
Let all people return to their true nature.
Love, kindness, wisdom, family harmony, and loyalty should not be taught one by one,
separately from an honest life.
Then, once again, people will regain the natural virtue of wholeness.
The world will be naturally ordered.
There will be no one who singly and cunningly works for personal interest alone.
