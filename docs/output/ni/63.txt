Do that which is not done by doing.
Make that which is not made by making.
Taste that which cannot be distinguished by taste.
Hold the same regard for the few and the many.
Requite the unkind with kindness.
Thus, one of subtle virtue desires what is not connected with desire,
sets no value on the rare goods of the world,
learns what is not learned through learning,
and induces people to return to that which they have overlooked.
