The subtle Way of the universe: is it not expressed in the stretching of a bow?
The high it presses down.
The low it lifts up.
The excessive it takes from.
The deficient it gives to.
It is the nature of this subtle truth to take from what is excessive and give to what is deficient.
The way of man, however, is otherwise.
It takes from those in need to give to those who already have more than enough.
Only one of whole virtue always has something to give to others.
Therefore, one of whole virtue does things, but does not keep them for himself;
accomplishes his tasks, but does not cling to them.
He has no desire to trade his virtue for people's worship.
