When the subtle Way of the universe is taught, people know where to go and what to learn,
because they know that they will not be harmed but will receive great peace.
The teacher of the universal Way is like one who gives real food to people.
He does not feed them colorful bait with the intention of catching them.
The subtle Way of the universe is flavorless, with nothing much to offer the mouth.
Neither does it offer much to be enjoyed by the eyes or entertain the ears, yet its usefulness is inexhaustible.
