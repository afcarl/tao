As for your fame and your life, which matters more?
As for your life and your wealth, which is more precious?
As for gain or loss, which is more damaging?
He who is most endeared to something must pay dearest for it.
He who has hoarded much will suffer great loss.
He who knows when enough is enough saves himself from humiliation.
He who knows when to stop protects himself from peril.
To know this is to be long enduring.
