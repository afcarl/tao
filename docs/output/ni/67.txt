The world may say that the subtle Way of the universe which I describe is great,
but that it has little bearing on worldly life.
Truly, it is just that it is not definable, like the small ways of the world, thus it is indeed great.
There are three treasures which I embrace and follow closely:
the first is to be kind;
the second is to be simple;
the third is to not put one's own importance first in the world.
Because kindness and compassion can produce courage,
simplicity can thus be broadened to contain the world.
By not putting your own importance first in worldly affairs,
you will not impede the natural growth of all things.
If a person endeavors to be brave without first being kind,
great purposed, without first simplifying his life,
an authority, without first denying himself,
he cannot evolve freely from strife, and is only courting destruction.
Kindness can help to win a war.
Kindness can help to defend a fortification.
Kindness will invite the corresponding energy of kindness from Heaven through all the divine beings who support and protect.
