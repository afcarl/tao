Nothing in the world is softer or more yielding than water.
But, for wearing down the hard and strong,
there is nothing like it.
That yielding overcomes the strong and softness overcomes the hard is something that is known by all,
but is practiced by few.
An ancient developed one said:
"He who can take the troubles of the people of the world is qualified to rule the world.
He who can tend to calamities for the sake of all beings is the right person to be the sovereign of the world."
Indeed, truth seems paradoxical!
