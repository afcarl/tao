The utterance of the universal subtle law is too loud to be audible.
Look at this: a squall does not last the whole morning, nor does a torrential shower last the whole day.
What determines this?
Even Nature cannot make such violence last for long.
How long, then, can the violent actions of human beings last?
Hence, one who follows gentleness becomes one with universal truth.
One who follows wholeness becomes one with universal virtue.
One who separates himself from universal nature and from universal virtue becomes separate and lost.
When one is one with universal nature,
universal nature is one with him.
When one is one with universal virtue,
universal virtue is one with him.
When one deviates from universal nature,
deviation keeps him from universal nature.
If one does not know and believe that the subtle law manifests in his own life,
how can he have faith that it pervades the entire universe?
