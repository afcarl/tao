When the people of the world live in accord with the subtle Way of the universe,
horses are used for agricultural purposes.
When the people of the world do not live in accord with the subtle Way of the universe,
then horses, even pregnant mares, are driven into the battlefield and bred there.
There is no greater calamity for a nation, or for an individual,
than not finding contentment with one's own sufficiency.
There is no greater mistake for a nation, or for an individual,
than to be covetous.
Hence, when one is content within one's own nature, one will always have enough.
