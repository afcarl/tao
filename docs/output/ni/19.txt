Abandon the separate concepts of holiness and unholiness.
Then all people will be benefitted a hundredfold.
Abandon the separate concepts of justice and humanism,
and all people will return to a natural state of harmony.
Abandon the cunning and cleverness of the mind,
and people will cease to rob and deceive one another.
These things are based on artifice and are thus inadequate to express the natural virtue of wholeness.
Hence, return to the true self to embrace only the one, unadorned nature.
Refine personal preference and desire.
End the endless search for segmented, intellectual knowledge,
and set your mind above worry and vexation.
In this way, one may restore one's unity with the perfection of one great universal life.
