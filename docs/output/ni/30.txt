One who assists a leader with the subtle truth of the universe advises him not to use the force of arms to try to conquer the world,
for such things will always rebound.
It is generally the nature of weapons to turn against their wielders.
Whenever armies touch the land,
they turn it into a wasteland.
Moreover, plague and death invariably follow in the wake of a great war.
Therefore, a leader should be allowed to effect only a right purpose and not rely on the force of arms once his goal has been achieved.
He effects his right purpose,
but does not take pride in it.
He effects his right purpose as a regrettable necessity.
He effects his right purpose,
but does not delight in violence,
for he knows that to be excessively strong is to hasten decay and that violence is against the integral nature of the universe.
Whoever goes against the nature of the universe will soon perish.
