Managing a big country is like cooking small fish.
The more you stir them, the less their shape can be maintained.
When one applies the subtle Way of the universe to the world,
all high spirits unite and harmonize their potencies.
Thus, they do not harm people.
All the world's leaders know to merge with the great Oneness,
thus all people are preserved from harm.
When the subtle Way of the universe is all pervading,
there is no longer any distinction between subject and object,
between spiritual and material,
between holy and unholy.
All energies merge into harmonious Oneness.
