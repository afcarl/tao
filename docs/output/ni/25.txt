Before Heaven and Earth are born, there is something formless and complete in itself.
Impalpable and everlasting,
silent and undisturbed,
standing alone and unchanging,
it exercises itself gently,
and generates itself inexhaustively in all dimensions.
It may be regarded as the Mother of all things.
Far beyond humankind's relative conception,
it cannot be referred to by a specific name,
yet it may be identified as the subtle essence of the universe.
In the absence of an accurate word,
I shall call it "the Great."
Being great, it extends itself without limit.
Extending itself without limit, it is far-reaching.
Being far-reaching, it ultimately reverts to itself,
returning to its self-sufficient origin.
Indeed, it had never really left itself!
This indefinable subtle energy flow is truly the greatest of all.
Expressing its integral nature,
the universal subtle essence remains intangible, yielding, and uncontrollable:
the ultimate expression of the cosmos.
As an expression of its unceasing creativeness,
it manifests as the spaciousness of the sky.
As an expression of its receptiveness,
it manifests as the great massiveness of galaxies, stars, and planets.
As an expression of harmonious reintegration,
it manifests as human life.
Thus, in the natural flow of energy transformation, human life becomes one of the four great expressions of the subtle essence of the universe.
It is the way of universal subtle integration.
Humankind conforms to Earth.
Earth conforms to the sky.
The sky conforms to the Subtle Origin.
The Subtle Origin conforms to its own nature.
These are the four peaks of manifestation from the great transformation of one universal subtle energy.
Taking an individual human life as example,
the intangible body with its fluids and nervous system construct a field of intangible, but functioning mind and super consciousness.
