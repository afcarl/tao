Can you always embrace Oneness without the slightest separation of body and mind?
Can you maintain undivided concentration until your vital force is as supple as a newborn baby's?
Can you clarify your inner vision to be flawless?
Can you love your people and serve your state with no self-exaltation?
As Life's Gate opens and closes in the performance of birth and death,
can you maintain the receptive, feminine principle when yin and yang are changing?
After achieving the crystal clear mind,
can you remain detached and innocent?
Give birth to and nourish all things without desiring to possess them.
Give of yourself, without expecting something in return.
Assist people, but do not attempt to control them.
This is how to realize the deep virtue of the universe.
