When people of the highest awareness hear the subtle Way of the universe,
they cultivate themselves diligently in order to live in accord with it.
When mediocre people hear the subtle Way of the universe,
they are unimpressed.
When people who are low hear the subtle Way of the universe,
they break into loud laughter.
If it were not laughed at,
it would not be the subtle Way of the universe.
Thus there is a traditional saying that he who understands the subtle Way of the universe seems dull of comprehension.
He who approaches the subtle Way of the universe seems to move away from it.
He who moves on the smooth path of the universe seems to go up and down as if traveling a rough road.
The deeply virtuous are like an empty, receptive valley.
The innocent appear to be sullied.
The abundant appear to be deficient.
The perfect appear to be defective.
The honest appear to be corrupt.
Hence, great space has no corners.
Great talent ripens late.
Great eloquence is silent.
Great form is shapeless.
The subtle essence of the universe is hidden and indefinable, yet its benefit is always subtly bestowed.
