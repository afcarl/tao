The yielding are preserved whole.
The crooked become straight.
The empty become filled.
The depleted are renewed.
What has little will gain.
What has much will become confused.
Therefore, one with a whole mind holds fast to the one essence and thereby becomes an example to the rest of the world.
Because he does not flaunt his brightness,
he becomes enlightened.
Because he is not self-important,
he becomes illustrious.
Because he does not boast of his accomplishments,
he becomes successful.
Because he is not self-assertive,
he becomes supreme.
Because he does not strive for superiority,
there is no one in the world who can contend with his superiority.
Indeed, the ancient teaching that "the yielding are preserved whole" is no empty saying.
Truly, they are preserved whole in order to attain one universal life.
