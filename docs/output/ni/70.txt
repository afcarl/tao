My words are very easy to understand and easy to practice,
yet the world can neither understand nor practice them.
My words have only one source: the subtle truth of the universe.
My deeds have only one master: the natural virtue of the universe.
The people of the world have no knowledge of this.
Thus, they have no knowledge of me.
The fewer the persons that know me,
the nobler are they that follow me.
Therefore, the one of whole virtue wears coarse clothes superficially,
but holds a precious treasure within.
