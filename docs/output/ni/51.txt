The natural essence of the universe gives life to all things.
Virtue nurses them.
Matter shapes them.
The natural environment brings them to maturity.
Therefore, all things without exception revere the subtle essence and honor virtue.
Though the subtle essence deserves reverence,
it does not demand it.
And though virtue ought to be honored,
it, too, does not demand it.
Thus, it is the subtle essence that gives life to all things, and with its virtue nurses them, grows them, fosters them, shelters them, comforts them, nourishes them and embraces them.
It does all this, yet it claims no possession,
expects no gratitude, and desires no lordship.
This is called the subtle virtue of the universe.
