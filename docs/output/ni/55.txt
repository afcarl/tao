One who is steeped in natural virtue is akin to a newborn babe.
Wasps and poisonous serpents do not sting it.
Fierce beasts do not seize it.
Birds of prey do not maul it.
Its bones are tender, its muscles soft, yet its grip is firm.
It has not known the union of male and female, yet its male member will stir naturally.
This is because its vitality is perfectly whole.
It can howl and scream all day long without becoming hoarse.
This is because it embodies perfect harmony.
To know harmony is to know natural virtue.
To recognize the natural virtue of the universe is to have insight.
To overprotect one's life is to invite danger.
To follow the fantasy of the mind is to drain away one's life energy.
To hasten growth is to hasten decay.
All of this is against the Way of natural virtue.
Whatever is against the Universal Way of life soon ceases to be.
