In high truth, is there any difference between yes and no?
Between good and evil, is there any absolute distinction?
Must one fear what everyone fears?
It is still too early for the subtle truth to dawn on those who are so self-assertive.
The people of the world run about excitedly as if they were going to miss the yearly, royal, sacrificial feast,
or as if they were going to be the last one to climb a high tower on a beautiful spring day.
I alone remain quiet and indifferent.
I anchor my being to that which existed before Heaven and Earth were formed.
I alone am innocent and unknowing, like a newborn babe.
Unoccupied by worldly cares, I move forward to nowhere.
The people of the world have more than enough.
I alone appear to have nothing.
The people of the world appear shrewd and wise.
I alone look foolish.
I like to be forgotten by the world and left alone.
Indeed, I have the mind of a single person!
Calm and self-contained, I am like the vast ocean.
Free and seemingly aimless, I am like a gentle wind.
Everyone seems so clever and self-assured.
I alone appear unlearned and original,
insistent upon a different direction than other people pursue.
I alone value taking my sustenance from the Mother.
