Tackle difficulties when they are easy.
Accomplish great things when they are small.
Handle what is going to be rough when it is still smooth.
Control what has not yet formed its force.
Deal with a dangerous situation while it is safe.
Manage what is hard while it is soft.
Eliminate what is vicious before it becomes destructive.
This is called "attending to great things at small beginnings."
A tree so big it can fill the span of a man's arms grows from a tiny sprout.
A terrace nine stories high rises from a shovelful of earth.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Thus, one of integral virtue never sets about grandiose things,
yet he is able to achieve great things.
Lightly made promises inspire little confidence.
Making light of things at the beginning,
one will meet with failure in the end.
Being prepared for hardship, one will not be overcome by it.
In handling their affairs, people often ruin them just as they are on the verge of success.
With heedfulness in the beginning and all the way through to the end,
nothing is ruined.
