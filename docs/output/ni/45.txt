The great perfection seems imperfect, yet its usefulness is unfailing.
The great fullness appears to be void, yet its usefulness is boundless.
The great accomplishment seems unfinished.
The ultimate straightness appears crooked.
Profound skillfulness appears clumsy.
Fluent eloquence seems mute.
Movement overcomes cold.
Stillness overcomes heat.
Maintain clarity and purity,
and be a model of deep virtue for all people.
