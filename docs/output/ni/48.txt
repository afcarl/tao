Learning builds daily accumulation,
but the practice of the Way of spiritual integration with the subtle essence of the universe builds daily simplification.
Simplify and simplify, until all contamination from relative, contradictory thinking is eliminated.
Then one does nothing, yet nothing is left undone.
One who wins the world does so by not meddling with it.
One who meddles with the world loses it.
