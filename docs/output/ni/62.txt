The subtle essence of the universe supports all things.
It is a treasure to virtuous people,
yet it is a refuge for unvirtuous people too.
Good words will find their market.
Good deeds may be presented as a gift to another.
Though a person has strayed from the right path,
the all-encompassing subtle essence of the universe will never abandon him.
Hence, at the enthronement of an emperor,
or the appointment of the three highest ministers of the empire,
rather than present them with discs of jade and teams of fine horses,
show them the priceless subtle Way of the universe.
Why did the ancients esteem the subtle Way of the universe?
Didn't they say that a seeker will find nothing,
but that he can be free from all transgression?
That is why it is such a treasure to the world.
