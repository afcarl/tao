When people lack a sense of pure spiritual piety toward natural life,
then awful things happen in their life.
Therefore, respect where you dwell.
Love your life and livelihood.
Because you do not disparage your life and livelihood, you will never become tired of life.
Thus, one of natural whole virtue respects his own life, but is not egotistical.
He loves his life, but does not exalt himself.
He holds a sense of spiritual serenity for all things, and disparages nothing.
Hence, he does what is right and gives up what is not right.
