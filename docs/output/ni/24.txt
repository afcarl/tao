One who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firmly.
One who strides cannot walk far.
One who flaunts himself is not illumined.
One who insists that he is right is self-righteous.
One who boasts of his accomplishments undoes his merit.
One who takes pride in himself impedes his own growth.
These things are normally detested by people who nurture virtue and the truthfulness of life,
for they do not set their eyes and hearts upon anything that is equal to "the greed for excessive food which fosters morbid growth."
Thus, such things are not agreeable to them.
