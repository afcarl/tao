The strategist who has achieved excellence says: dare not to be the host, but rather be the guest.
Dare not to be the restless aggressor, but rather be the calm defender.
Dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.
March forward where there is no obstacle.
Stretch out your arm only where there is no confrontation.
Charge an opponent where there is no resistance.
Hold a weapon that is invisible.
There is no greater mistake than to underestimate the power of an opponent.
To underestimate the power of an opponent may cost a man his life.
Therefore, when opposing troops meet in battle,
it is the side with the greatest caution that wins.
