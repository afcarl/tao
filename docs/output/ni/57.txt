When serving the public, use upright means.
When commanding troops in war, employ the principle of surprise.
To win the world, do nothing to interfere with it.
Why?
Because the more prohibitions and inhibitions that are imposed on people,
the more difficult their lives become.
The more destructive weapons a nation or its people possess,
the poorer the people of that country become,
and the greater is the chaos that occurs in the world.
The more clever and crafty people become,
the more often strange things happen.
The more laws and ordinances there are,
the more criminals and dissidents will arise.
Therefore, the ancient sages of natural virtue said:
"I do nothing, and people's contention dissolves by itself.
I enjoy serenity, and people rectify themselves.
I make no effort, and people enrich themselves.
I have no desire, and people return to simplicity."
