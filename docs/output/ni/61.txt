A great country is like the lower regions of a river: a place where all the streams of the world unite.
She is the mother of the world.
The peaceful and feminine always overpowers the masculine.
Being peaceable, one takes the lower position.
Hence, if a great country can lower itself to greet a small country,
it will win the friendship and trust of the small country.
If a small country can lower itself to greet a great country,
it will win the friendship and support of the great country.
One wins by taking the lower position,
while the other wins by remaining low.
Thus, if each is to find its proper place,
the one that is great must place itself low and offer help.
