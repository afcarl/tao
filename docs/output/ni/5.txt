The subtle virtue of the universe is wholeness.
It regards all things as equal.
The virtue of the sage is wholeness.
He too regards all things as equal.
The universe may be compared to a bellows.
It is empty, yet it never fails to generate its products.
The more it moves, the more it brings forth.
Many words lead one nowhere.
Many pursuits in different directions bring only exhaustion.
Rather, embrace the subtle essence within.
