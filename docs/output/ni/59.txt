In managing people and serving Heaven, there is nothing better than sparing unnecessary activities and expense.
To be thrifty means to return to the simple essence of life.
To return to the simple essence of life is to nourish subtle virtue.
To nourish subtle virtue is to be able to overcome any difficulty.
Being able to overcome difficulties,
one can break through all limitations.
One's limitlessness is derived from whole and boundless virtue.
The source of such virtue can support one to serve a nation.
Then one's benevolence can be enduring.
This is the way to firmly plant and deeply root oneself in the subtle path of universal integration.
This is the achievement of the Way of immortality.
