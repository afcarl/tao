Even after settling a great dispute, some resentment is likely to remain.
Can this be considered a true settlement?
Only by cultivating the virtue of wholeness and by returning injury with kindness can there be true harmony.
Therefore, one of deep virtue always gives without expecting gratitude.
One whose virtue is deep treats the world as if he were the debtor,
holding the left side of the tally.
He willingly repays the world through serving his fellow man.
One who is partially virtuous treats the world as if he were the creditor,
holding the right side of the tally.
He thinks the world owes him something and should repay him.
Although the subtle Way of the universe holds no favoritism or partiality,
it always supports those who are naturally virtuous.
