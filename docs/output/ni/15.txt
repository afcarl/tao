The ancient ones who knew how to live with the subtle essence of the universe were gentle and flexible, profound and indistinguishable.
They were too deep to be known, thus we can only describe their appearance.
They did not rush into anything,
as if fording an icy stream in early winter.
They were retiring and hesitant, not assertive,
as if they were shy of people.
They were reverent in demeanor to everyone,
as if meeting honored guests.
They did not insist on imposing their views on others or interfering in worldly affairs,
as if they were passing travelers.
They adapted themselves to a circumstance like melting ice.
Simple and genuine, they were like virgin timber.
Empty and receptive, they were like a huge cave.
Comprehensive and unprejudiced,
they were equally kind to all things;
like the water of a stream flowing down a mountain, they benefitted all things.
Who else could move constantly from the gross and heavy to the light and pure?
Who else could evolve steadily from the inert and stagnant to everlasting life?
Those who hold fast to the subtle essence of the universe do not desire to extend themselves in climax.
Because there is no climax to one's extension and expansion, life is continually renewing itself.
