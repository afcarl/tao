The subtle essence of the universe is omnipresent.
It may go to the left or the right.
All things derive their life from it,
and it holds nothing back from them,
yet it takes possession of nothing.
It accomplishes its purpose,
but it claims no merit.
It clothes and feeds all,
but has no ambition to be master over anyone.
Thus it may be regarded as "the Small."
All things return to it, and it contains them,
yet it claims no authority over them.
Thus it may be recognized as "the Great."
The wise one who never attempts to be emotionally great and who accomplishes each small task with full devotion,
as if it were the greatest of tasks, is naturally recognized as great.
