How does the sea become the queen of all rivers and streams?
By lying lower than they do!
Hence, it is the queen of all rivers and streams.
One who humbles himself, therefore, can serve all people.
By putting himself last, he comes to be their leader.
Thus, when one of subtle virtue is set above people,
they do not feel that he is their burden.
And, when he stands in front of people,
they do not feel that he is an obstruction to them.
Therefore, the world follows one of subtle virtue joyfully,
and never tires of doing so.
He does not compete with anyone,
thus he is above all competition.
