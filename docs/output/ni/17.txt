High beings of deep universal virtue work unassertively.
They help all people,
yet people are barely aware of their existence.
Leaders of great achievement earn the friendship and praise of people.
Leaders of great strength make people afraid.
People despise and defy a leader who is untrustworthy.
One cannot inspire confidence in people through words alone;
it must be accompanied by correct deeds.
When one of subtle virtue has accomplished his task, all the people will say:
"It is we ourselves who made it so."
