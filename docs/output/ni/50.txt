That one's physical life will begin with birth and end in death seems a surety.
Also, in an individual life, the special opportunities of life and death are very much equal.
When there is an opportunity for death,
there is an opportunity for life also.
When there is an unusual opportunity for life,
it pulls one's life closer to death.
Aside from such opportunities,
there is the personal effort to maintain normalcy.
This is much more reliable than the special opportunities which place one's life on the verge of life and death.
People of awareness value normalcy and forsake seeking special opportunities which hold the promise of increasing the strength of living.
Such things are eventually only ways to speed up one's life.
One who can enjoy his natural life is content with the life of simple normalcy.
As I was told, one who knows how to tend his life with simple normalcy,
does not meet wild animals on the road or know the touch of weapons during war.
The mighty horns of the rhinoceros,
the powerful claws of the tiger,
the sharp blades of weapons,
find nowhere to pierce him.
Why is this so?
Because his mind holds no uncanny thoughts he gives death no opportunity.
