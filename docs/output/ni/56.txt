One who knows does not speak.
One who speaks does not know.
The one who knows is the one whose doors are shut, whose openings are blocked, whose sharpness is blunted, and whose glare is softened.
He is one with the subtle truth of the universe.
Thus you cannot get close to such a person by your love to do so,
nor can you keep away from him by your desire to do so.
You cannot bestow benefit on him,
nor can you do him harm,
because he holds the subtle essence of the universe.
