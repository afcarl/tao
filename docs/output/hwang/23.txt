Lao Tze says,
Be less, this is the spontaneous rule.
Hence a gusty wind does not persist through all morning.
A sudden downpour does not persist through a whole day.
Who makes them so?
The Heaven and the Earth.
Even the Heaven and the Earth don't like to perform a long work, what more can be expected from men?
Thus,
Whoever devotes himself to the Tao will know the Tao's essence.
Whoever devotes himself to the Teh will know the Teh's essence.
Whoever devotes to the loss will know the loss's essence.
Whoever matches the Tao's essence will find pleasure in the Tao.
Whoever matches the Teh's essence will find pleasure in the Teh.
Whoever matches the loss will find pleasure in the loss.
Those men who can't believe what I said already have disbelieving hearts.
