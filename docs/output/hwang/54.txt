Lao Tze says,
He who is skillful in establishment shall establish the Tao in his heart so that no one can pluck it.
He who is skillful in enfolding arms shall enfold the Teh in his arms so that no one can take it.
From generation to generation his ancestral sacrifices shall be continued without fail.
When this precept is applied by whomever to instruct himself, his character will be made true;
applied to his neighborhood, his neighborhood will thrive;
applied to the state, his state will find good fortune;
applied to the world, the world will inherit with good traditions.
In this way he can observe the others in comparison with the self;
observe others' families in comparison with his own family;
observe others' neighborhoods in comparison with his own neighborhood;
observe others' states in comparison with his own state;
observe the world before in comparison with what it is now.
How do I know that this effect is sure to hold all in the world?
By observation.
