Lao Tze says,
If a king of men knows to regulate human affairs by using the way of Heaven, he should know there is nothing better than to be sparing.
It is only by being sparing that an early obedience to the Tao is effected.
That early obedience is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes.
With the repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the conquest of every obstacle in the way.
Of this conquest he knows not what shall be the limit, and when he knows not what the limit shall be, he is qualified to be the ruler of a state.
He who possesses this motherly method of governing may continue to hold his rulership.
This method may be compared to a giant tree with its roots deep and its flower stalks firm;
and it is also a way which leads to enjoy long life and eternal gazing.
