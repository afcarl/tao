Lao Tze says,
Which means more to you, fame or self?
Which brings more to you, self or property?
Which ails you more, gain or loss?
The cost of the thing which you love is dear.
The treasure unscrupulously laid up shall result in heavy loss.
However, the contented man will not suffer disgrace.
A man who knows his limitations will not incur danger.
Namely, he can survive forever.
