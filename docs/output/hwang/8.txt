Lao Tze says,
Ultimate goodness shall be found in water.
Water is good at helping all things, being free of conflict with them.
It stays in places that most people despise, so it is closest to the Tao.
It provides benefit wherever it stays,
illustrates the example of good men's hearts by forming the depth of the abyss,
distributes to the needy one to demonstrate benevolence,
reflects genuine images to interpret credibility,
removes dirty things to purify the government,
transforms to different shapes to display its capability,
moves as the seasons change to show timeliness.
Because water never competes with others, hence no one will resent it.
