Lao Tze says,
Gravity is the root of lightness.
Serenity is the ruler of hastiness.
Hence the sage practices the Tao all day long,
leaving no serene mind and heavy attitude.
Though a king can have seraglios and harems, he has to avoid approaching them.
Regretful are kings nowadays, they are very powerful, having ten thousand chariots and riders;
yet their attitude is light before the eyes of the people.
Light attitude will cause the loss of their subordinates;
hasty mind will cause the loss of their thrones.
