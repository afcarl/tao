Lao Tze says,
When the great Tao is not in use, benevolence and righteousness come into vogue.
When wisdom and shrewdness appear, there ensures great hypocrisy.
When six kinships no longer live at peace, filial piety and lenity find their manifestation.
When the state falls into chaos, loyal ministers appear.
