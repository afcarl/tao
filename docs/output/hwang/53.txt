Lao Tze says,
Make me have sudden enlightenment,
I can implement great Tao in government.
Still I am afraid I might go astray.
Great Tao is a smooth and easy highway,
My noblemen like to walk on its trails.
Your courtyards are new and pretty,
Your people's farms are still unfilled.
There is nothing in their barns.
You wear your embroidered gowns,
Walk with sharp-bladed swords.
You satiate with good food and drink,
Collect abundant wealth beyond your deserving.
I shall call you Taoku, the bandit's chief,
For you have never practiced the way of the Tao.
