Lao Tze says,
Since the beginning of the universe, there was the Tao which may be regarded as the mother of all existence.
When a man knows about the mother, he has to know about the son.
When he knows about the son, he proceeds to guard the mother that belongs to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril.
Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up his eyes, and all his life he will be exempt from toil.
Let him keep his mouth open, and his eyes be used to examine the affairs, and all his life there will not be safety for him.
The perception of smallness is clear-sighted;
the guard of the soft and tender grows strong.
He who uses his light reverting to become bright, will ward all blight from his eyesight.
This is the so-called learning of the absolute.
