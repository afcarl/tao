Lao Tze says,
He who has in himself abundant Teh, the attribute of the Tao, is like a baby.
Poisonous insects will not sting him;
fierce beasts will not seize him;
and birds of prey will not pounce upon him.
A baby is weak with tender bones and feeble sinews, but his grasp is firm and tight.
He doesn't know men and women's affairs, yet his virile member may be excited, showing the perfection of his vigor.
He cries all day long without his throat becoming hoarse, thus showing the perfection of his harmonious constitution.
When one knows harmony, he knows the absolute.
When he knows the absolute, he deserves to be called the enlightened.
But he who knows the life-increasing arts transforms himself by having an evil heart.
He who lets his emotions go through impulse is called strong.
When things become strong in maturity, they become old,
which may be said to be contrary to the Tao.
Whatever is contrary to the Tao ends soon.
