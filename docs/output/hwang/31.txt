Lao Tze says,
The strong military force is an unlucky emblem to the state, thus all living creatures would abhor it.
The Tao practicians should not promote it too.
The upright man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honorable place, but in time of war the right hand.
The military force is an unlucky emblem, it is not the emblem for the upright man.
It is manipulated on the compulsion of necessity.
Calm and repose should be prized;
victory is not regarded as a beautiful work.
Whoever regards victory as a beautiful work, he is one who takes delight in killing men.
Whoever likes to kill men will not succeed in his ambition to rule the world.
On occasion of rejoicing, precedence is given to the left;
on occasion of mourning, precedence is given to the right.
The second in command of an army has his place on the left;
the chief commander has position of the right;
this says: a funeral is taking place.
The lamentation is observed for the numerous dead who were killed on the battlefield.
Thus, a victory ceremony is being held in the funeral rite.
