Lao Tze says,
The Tao's accomplishment is constantly made through acting without the intent to control fate, yet leaving nothing undone.
If the king of men insists on practicing the Tao, all existence will transform themselves in their natural courses.
When they transform and go out of their way, the king of men should guide them back to a pristine simplicity which was unknown to the world before.
Namely, the pristine simplicity of being desireless.
To be desireless is cultivated by being still.
It is by this stillness that this world is settled down in peace naturally.
