Lao Tze says,
If sanctified tenets can be renounced, and craftiness given up, people will thus profit hundredfold.
If worship of benevolence can be renounced, and adoration of righteousness given up, people will resume filial piety and lenience.
If artful contrivance and scheming for gain can be given up, there will be no thieves or robbers.
These three epigrams may not be enough for guidance.
I'd bid even more as:
Sight the simplicity, arms enfold plain and true, extinguish selfish mind and eschew lust.
