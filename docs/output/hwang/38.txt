Lao Tze says,
The superior Teh is not conscious of virtue, thus it matches the essence of virtue.
The secondary Teh is conscious of virtue, thus it leaves the essence of virtue.
The man of the superior Teh works by acting without the intent to control fate; the people think he has done nothing else.
The man of the secondary Teh does work by acting with the intent to control fate and the people think he has done a lot of work.
The man of benevolence has done a lot of work, but through acting without the intent to control fate.
The man of righteousness has done a lot of work, this is through acting with intent to control fate.
The man of ritualism has done a lot of work, however he can't get the resonance of approval, thus he would force others to express their appreciation.
Therefore,
when the Tao is not in use, they seek benevolence;
when the benevolence is not in use, they seek ritualism.
However, the ritualism is the production of the lack of the loyalty and the faith, and it is even the beginning of confusion.
The above mentioned men understand Tao's extravagance only.
They are the founders of stupidity.
Henceforth, a true great man should choose Tao's abundance instead of Tao's deficiency.
He should choose Tao's essence instead of Tao's extravagance.
Thus, a Tao practician should learn to choose the former, and despise the latter.
