Lao Tze says,
The man who knows the way of nourishing his spirit shall attain immortality.
The man who has attained immortality used his nose and mouth well.
The outlet of the nose and mouth can breathe the elements,
which are the roots of the Heaven and the Earth.
In gentleness and perpetuity, he shall proceed to breathe.
By diligence and attention, he shall practice the exercise.
