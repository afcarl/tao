Lao Tze says,
In the highest antiquity, people only knew that there were rulers.
Next were those they loved and praised.
Then there were those they feared.
And finally there were those they despised.
Thus it was when the ruler was deficient in the Tao faith that his people ensured him with want of faith.
How irresolute are those who appreciate reticence.
Although the work was completed and the undertaking successful, all the people would say, 'it happened to us naturally.'
