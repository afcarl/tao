Lao Tze says,
He who stands on tiptoe can't persist long.
He who walks by striding can't go far.
He who sees everything in his eyes can never be shrewd.
He who claims self-righteousness will never be exalted by others.
He who steals others' feats for himself is a worthless person.
He who boasts of his merit can't enjoy a long life.
Viewed from the Tao's standpoint, these men are like remains of a meal, or a tumor on the body, which no one would like.
Hence, a Tao-practician should not become one of them.
