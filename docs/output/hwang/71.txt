Lao Tze says,
To know and yet think you don't know is the highest attainment;
not to know and yet think you know is sick-minded.
It is simply in being pained at the thought of having sick-mindedness that one is free from being sick-minded.
The sage is not sick-minded because he knows the pain that would be inseparable from sick-mindedness and therefore he is totally exempted from this sick-mindedness.
