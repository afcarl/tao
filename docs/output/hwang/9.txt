Lao Tze says,
A full utensil in hand has to be halted.
The blade sharpened to the thinnest edge, cannot be endured long.
A hall full of jewels and gold, can never be safely guarded.
A man who takes pride in richness and nobleness, has his downfall because of the seeds he sowed.
Recess at the day of success, such is the way of Heaven.
