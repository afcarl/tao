Lao Tze says,
When a reconciliation is made between two parties, surely a grudge still remains in one of them.
How can this be counted as a decent method?
Therefore the sage guards against this method.
He keeps the left-hand tally, and does not insist on the fulfillment of it by others.
So he who has the attribute of the Tao keeps the tally;
while he who has not the attribute of the Tao keeps the record of taxing.
In the way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love;
it is always on the side of a good man.
