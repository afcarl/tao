Lao Tze says,
He who is skillful as a good warrior assumes no martial posture.
He who is skillful as a good gladiator will not rise in anger.
He who is skillful in vanquishing his foes will keep apart from them.
He who is skillful in employing will keep a low profile.
All these are the attributes of non-contention,
the methods of using man's abilities,
the way of matching with Heaven's secret,
and the highest art of antiquity.
