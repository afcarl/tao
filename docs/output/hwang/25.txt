Lao Tze says,
There was something nebulous and complete which came into existence before the Heaven and the Earth.
It was soundless and formless, stood alone, and would not change, reached everywhere and was in no danger of being exhausted.
It is capable of being the mother of the world.
I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao, and it is further described as the great.
Being great it receded.
Receding, it became remote.
Having become remote, it turns back.
Therefore,
the Tao is great,
the Heaven is great,
the Earth is great,
and the Kingship is also great.
In the universe there are four elements that are great, and the Mankind is one of them.
The Mankind takes his law from the Earth,
the Earth takes its law from the Heaven,
and the Heaven takes its law from the Tao.
The law of the Tao is its being what it is.
