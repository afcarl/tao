Lao Tze says,
If there is a king who wishes to take over the world and establishes a man-made order, I can predict that he will not make it at all.
For the world is of divine entity and it can't be subjugated to a man-made order.
Whoever wants to try will result in failure.
Whoever insists on his point of view will plunge in loss.
Because,
when one wishes to march forward, others just follow reluctantly;
when one wishes to breathe making a thing warm, others blow it cold;
when one wishes to strengthen it, others wish to weaken it;
when one wishes to sustain it, others wish to destroy it.
Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence.
