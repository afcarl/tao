Lao Tze says,
That which remains still is easy to hold;
that which has not yet given indication of its presence is easy to measure against;
that which is brittle is easily broken;
and that which is minute is easily dispersed.
Deal with a thing before its disorder has made its appearance, and govern an affair before its confusion has begun.
A tree which fills the arms grows from a tiny sprout;
a tower of nine floors rises from a heap of earth;
a journey of a thousand li begins at one's feet.
He who acts with an intent to control fate does harm;
he who takes hold of a thing in the same way loses his hold.
The sage works without an intent to control fate, and therefore does no harm.
He does not lay hold so, and therefore does not lose his hold.
People who conduct their affairs often ruin them on the eve of their success.
If they are careful at the end, as they were careful at the beginning;
then there would be no ruined affairs.
Therefore, the sage desires what other men do not desire, and does not value objects which are difficult to obtain.
He learns what other men do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by.
Thus he assists all existence to develop in a natural course, and does not dare to act with an intent to control fate.
