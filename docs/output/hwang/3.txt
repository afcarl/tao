Lao Tze says,
When I don't promote those men of high character to the position of authority and give them gifts, then people will not strive to follow their examples.
When I don't value those things which are difficult to attain, then people will be kept from becoming thieves.
When I don't let people see things which will excite evil desires, their minds will be kept from becoming disordered.
Therefore, when a sage is in charge of the government, he prefers to humble people's minds, feed their stomachs, weaken their ambitions, and make their frames strong.
He constantly keeps them from knowledge and from desire, and those who have knowledge would not presume to act against this rule.
When practicing acting without the intent to control fate, there is no evil which can't be cured.
