Lao Tze says,
A man at his living is tender and weak and at his death adamant and strong.
Living creatures and plants at their living are soft and supple and at their death dry and withered.
Thus those who are adamant and strong are the concomitant of death;
and soft and weak, the concomitant of life.
Hence he who relies on the strength of his forces can not win,
and a tree which grows to be strong will invite the feller.
Hence the rule:
The big and the strong stay underneath and the soft and the weak exist above.
