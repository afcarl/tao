Lao Tze says,
Without stepping outside the door, a man can know what has taken place in the world.
Without looking out the window, a man can discern the Tao of Heaven.
The farther a man goes out, the less he knows.
Therefore, the sages got their knowledge not through visiting there;
gave their names to things not because they had seen them;
and accomplished their ends not because they ever had intent to control fate.
