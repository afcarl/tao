Lao Tze says,
The Tao in the void state works on everything.
It guards against fullness.
Its depth is unfathomable, as if it were the honored ancestor of all things.
It blunts the sharp points, sets in order the tangles, tempers the light, and agrees with the obscurity of others.
How pure and still the Tao is, as if it would ever stand.
I do not know its origin, and it seems to have existed before the coming of all gods.
