Lao Tze says,
The great Tao flows everywhere.
There is no discrimination of what is the right and what is the left.
All existence lives up to it, and it denies no one.
It doesn't claim credit, though there is achievement.
It loves and nourishes all existence but does not lord over them.
It appears ambitionless and is regarded as less important.
All existence returns to it, and it doesn't dominate them.
Certainly this is great.
This is the reason that the sage never regards himself as great,
thus he deserves to be titled as great.
