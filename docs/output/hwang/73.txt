Lao Tze says,
He who is fearless in his daring to do wrong goes against the Tao, and meets with death.
He who is fearless in his not daring to do so, remains alive.
Of these two cases one is apparently advantageous, and the other harmful.
But when Heaven's hate imposes on a man, who would know why?
On this account even the sage feels it is difficult to understand.
The way of Heaven does not contend yet skillfully excels in overcoming;
it does not speak yet skillfully responds to asking;
it does not summon yet attracts men to it.
It is unselfish and magnanimous, yet its plans are skillful and effective.
The net of Heaven spreads wide with its meshes far apart;
yet it lets nothing slip through.
