Lao Tze says,
Sincere words are not charming and charming words are not sincere.
Those who know the Tao do not like to dispute;
and the disputing persons do not know the Tao.
Wise men do not have to own vast knowledge, those with vast knowledge are not wise.
The sage doesn't like to accumulate things for himself.
The more he works for others, the more he possesses of his own;
and the more he gives to others, the more blessings he receives in return.
The way of Heaven is full of sharpness but injures no one.
The way of sages is to make an effort but to consider not the competition.
