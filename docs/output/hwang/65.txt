Lao Tze says,
In ancient times, those who learned the Tao in exercise of the government would work not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them ignorant.
The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much craftiness.
He who tries to govern a state by his craftiness is a scourge to the state;
and he who does not try to do so is a boon to the state.
He who knows these two different results finds in them an absolute rule.
Ability to know this absolute rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence.
Profound and far-reaching is this mysterious excellence;
showing indeed its possessor to be contrary to others, but leading him to be completely obedient to the Tao.
