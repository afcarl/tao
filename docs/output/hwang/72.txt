Lao Tze says,
The time when people do not fear punishment is the time when a great dread will descend upon them.
Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life.
Let them not act as if they are weary of what life depends on.
It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise.
Therefore the sage knows himself, but does not parade his knowledge;
loves himself, but does not value himself.
Therefore he rejects the punishment and accepts the gentility.
