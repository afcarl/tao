Lao Tze says,
Whoever seeks the extremity of the void will preserve genuine stillness.
When all existence alike goes through the process of transformation, it returns to its original state.
All existence is prosperous as prosperous flowers and leaves which finally decay and return to their roots.
This returning to their roots is what we call the action of being still;
and the action of being still is a response to the rule of relapsing to one's origin.
The rule of relapsing to one's origin is the absolute, the unchanging rule.
To know that unchanging rule is to be enlightened;
to know not the absolute rule leads to haphazard action and evil issues.
The knowledge of the absolute and the unchanging rule produces the capacity of inclusiveness, and the capacity of inclusiveness produces the character of justice.
The character of justice goes on to become the king-like character.
And the king-like character goes on to become the heaven-like character.
In that likeness to heaven, such character possesses the Tao.
He who possesses the Tao endures for a long time, and the end of his corporeal life is exempt from all danger of decay.
