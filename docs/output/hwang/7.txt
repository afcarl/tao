Lao Tze says,
The Heaven has endured a long existence, so has the Earth.
The reason they can last so long is that they never go out of their way to seek life, hence they can be everlasting.
The sage understood this secret, put himself last, and became first at length.
He treated himself as extraneous, preserving his person safe and sound.
Cannot one who is selfless fulfill the selfishness?
