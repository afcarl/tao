Lao Tze says,
May not the way of Heaven be compared to bending a bow?
The upper end is where Heaven presses down, and the bottom end is where Heaven lifts up.
So the extra length is shortened;
the insufficient width is expanded.
It is the way of Heaven to reduce from those that have too much, and increase to those that have not enough.
It is not so with the way of Man.
He takes away from those who have not enough to add to those that have too much.
Who can have too much and spare to give to the entire world?
Only he who is enlightened in the Tao.
Therefore the sage works without claiming his endeavor.
He achieves his task and does not rest arrogantly in it.
For he does not wish to display his superiority.
