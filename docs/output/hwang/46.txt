Lao Tze says,
When the world lives in accord with the Tao, racing horses are sent to the dung-cart.
When the world lives not in accord with the Tao, the war-horses breed on the border.
There is no sin greater than to sanction ambition;
no calamity greater than not being contented;
no fault greater than the wish to obtain.
Therefore, he who is content with contentment shall be always content.
