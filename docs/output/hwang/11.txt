Lao Tze says,
It takes thirty spokes to share one nave.
Because a nave is a void space, we can have the use of the cart.
People knead clay to make a bowl.
Because a bowl is void in the center, we can use the bowl.
People cut out of a wall to make a door and a window.
Because they are void spaces, we can have the use of apartments.
Thus, this is something we can gain, that the positive existence shall serve for profitable adaption,
and that which has no existence shall serve for its purpose.
