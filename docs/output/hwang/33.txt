Lao Tze says,
He who knows others is intelligent, while he who knows himself is enlightened.
He who conquers others has the power of muscles, but he who conquers himself is strong.
He who knows contentment is rich, but he who is determined has strength of will.
He who does not leave the resource will endure, but he who knows to keep as still as a dead body but remain dynamic will enjoy longevity.
