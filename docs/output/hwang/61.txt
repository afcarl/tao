Lao Tze says,
Like water, a large state should keep a low profile as it goes down stream, in order that it becomes the pivot of the world.
The female is the master of the world.
The female always overcomes the male by being still.
Stillness may be considered as a sort of abasement.
Thus a large state, by abasing itself to smaller states, annexes the small states;
while small states, by abasing themselves, affiliate themselves with larger states.
In one case the abasement leads to gaining allies, in the other case it procures favors.
The large state wishes only to increase population;
small states wish only to be guarded.
Each gets what it desires, but the large state must learn to abase itself first.
