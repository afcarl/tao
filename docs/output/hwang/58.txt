Lao Tze says,
When the government is dull and drowsy, its people are simple and sincere.
When the government is sharp and shrewd, its people are dishonest and deceitful.
Disaster is that by which side fortune is to be found.
Fortune is that beneath which disaster lurks.
Who would be able to know its ultimate results?
If a king of men cannot dispense with correction, correct subjects will in their turn become distorted, and a good government will in its turn become evil.
The delusion of the ruler on this point has indeed subsisted for a long time.
Therefore the sage inherits correctitude like a square symbol, but punishes no one.
He inherits honest property, but tells no tales.
He is straightforward, but allows himself no license.
He is bright, but does not dazzle.
