Lao Tze says,
Governing a great state is like cooking small fish.
The king of men knows to pacify his kingdom by using the Tao;
the dead men's ghosts will not manifest their spiritual energy.
Not only will those ghosts not manifest their spiritual energy, but they will not hurt men.
Not only will they hurt men, even the sage in exercise of his government will not disturb those ghosts.
As these two do not injuriously affect each other, so in the Tao's attribute, the living and the departed both find their rest places.
