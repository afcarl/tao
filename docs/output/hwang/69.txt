Lao Tze says,
A master of strategy once said,
'I do not dare to be the first to arouse a war.
I prefer to be passive to rise against an invasion.
I do not dare to march an inch.
I prefer to withdraw a foot.'
This is called proceeding to make an action without walking, to resist without lifting arms;
to dart without facing enemies, and to seize them without combating.
There is no calamity greater than to lightly engage in war.
To do that nearly results in the loss of the three precious things I mentioned before.
That is why when opposing armies meet, the sorrowful side conquers.
