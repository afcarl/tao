Lao Tze says,
He who practices acting without intent to control fate will find that there is no business which is troubling him to manage.
He who can taste a tasteless thing will learn to regard what is small as great, and a few as many;
and to recompense injury with kindness.
He will deal with things that are difficult while they are easy,
and handle things that would become great while they are still small.
All difficult things in the world arise from an original state of having been easy,
and all great things arise from an original state of having been small.
Therefore the sage never attempts to achieve a great feat.
He who makes promises lightly rarely keeps good faith.
He who likes to think things will be easy will find them difficult.
Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, so they are always free of difficulties.
