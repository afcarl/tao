Lao Tze says,
When the people in the world gain a knowledge of that which is beautiful,
they will also gain a knowledge of that which is ugly.
When they gain a knowledge of that which belongs to the realm of the good,
they will also gain a knowledge of that which belongs to the realm of the bad.
Existence and non-existence shall rotate to take place;
difficulty and ease impress people by the prepossession;
length long and short are acknowledged in comparison;
tallness and lowness confront to make contrast;
harmonious musical pieces, the notes and tones interdepend;
that which is before or behind leads or follows the other.
Therefore, there is a sage who likes to do business without the intent to control fate and conveys his instruction without speech.
All things make an effort to prosper, and there is no one who comes to interfere with them.
Moreover, the one who gives life to all things does not claim ownership of them;
works laboriously for them, and does not expect a reward in return;
establishes the feat for them, and does not confess the achievement.
Because it does not confess the achievement, no one can forget the achievement.
