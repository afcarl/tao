Lao Tze says,
The king of men should always think that his state is little, and his people a small population.
He would attribute the governing responsibility to ten or a hundred tribal elders.
His government would never consider to draft people's implements for government use.
Further, he would make his people's looking after departed ancestors estates an important duty, thus they would not move elsewhere.
Though the king of men has boats and carriages, he would have no occasion to ride on them.
Though he had buff coats and sharp weapons, he would have no occasion to use them.
He would make the people return to their pure custom which they used in antiquity - the knotted cord to remember events.
At that time, they thought their coarse food sweet;
their plain clothes beautiful;
their poor dwelling places restful;
and common simple ways sources of enjoyment.
There should be a neighboring state within sight, and the voices of fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from hither to thither, but the people to an old age, even to death, have no intention to visit each other.
