Lao Tze says,
The sage doesn't have an invariable mind, he takes people's minds as his own mind.
Those who are good to him;
he treats well;
and those who are not good to him;
he treats well too;
thus all become good to each other.
To those who are sincere;
he is sincere;
and to those who are not sincere;
he is also sincere;
thus all become sincere.
The sage in the world pays scrupulous attention to everything.
However, he treats his living with indifference.
The people all offer their eyes and ears to help him, and he deals with them all as his children.
