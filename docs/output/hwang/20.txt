Lao Tze says,
When knowledge is discarded, there will be no worries.
Yes, or pretending to say yes, how much are they different?
One is good the other is evil.
The difference is too great.
Most men fear the kings of knowledge, who are certainly formidable.
The world is full of fornication, and its motion cannot be discontinued.
Lasciviousness exceedingly holds people's minds, which they anticipate to enjoy as hungry men at full banquets, as men feel comfortable mounting towers in spring.
I alone keep quiet, as a baby who is not fully grown up, and has no desire in his mind.
To and fro, I walk; I can't find a place to stay.
People all have had sufficiency, while I still remain in destitution.
My behavior is like a fool in people's eyes.
Secular men are fast and make haste; but I do not intend to fetch anything.
Vast is the sea; its water flows to where there is no end.
People all seem to have had great achievement, while I am still naughty and stubborn.
I am different from others.
I rely on the Tao too much, as a baby longing for mother's milk.
