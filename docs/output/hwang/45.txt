Lao Tze says,
The greatest accomplishment seems to have blemishes, but when applied, it is long enduring.
The greatest fullness seems to be vacant, but when applied, it is inexhaustible.
The greatest straightness seems crooked.
The greatest craftiness seems stupid.
The greatest eloquence seems dumb.
Restlessness overcomes the cold;
being still overcomes the heat.
Purity and stillness give correct law to all in the world.
