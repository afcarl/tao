Lao Tze says,
My words are very easy to know and very easy to practice;
but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practice them.
In my words there is a traditional precept and a ruling art.
It is because that they do not know these, that men do not know me.
That is why there are few that know me, and there are even fewer that model after me.
There is a sage who wears coarse clothes and hides jade in his bosom, which anyone shall see.
