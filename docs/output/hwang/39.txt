Lao Tze says,
Old things which have the correctness are:
It is by correctness that
the Heaven becomes bright and pure, and the Earth firm and sure;
the spirits divine;
the valleys full;
all existence lively;
and the kings just for the world's model.
All these are the results of correctness.
If the Heaven were not so pure, it would soon rend.
If the Earth were not so sure, it would break and bend.
If the spirits were not so divine, they would lose their prophesy.
If the valleys were not so full, they would parch.
If all existence were not so lively, they would be extinct.
If the kings had no morality, they would collapse from their throne.
Therefore, dignity finds root in meanness, and the lofty find their stability in lowness.
Therefore, the kings self-styled themselves by the solitary, the unworthy, and the virtueless.
Didn't these mean that dignity finds its root in its meanness?
Didn't these?
So, when we analyze a cart's construction, we can't find a part named cart.
As for me, I would neither appreciate being regarded as a jade rare and expensive, nor as a stone popular and cheap.
