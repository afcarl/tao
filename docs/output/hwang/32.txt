Lao Tze says,
The Tao is not designated as a certain type.
The pristine simplicity is just a small display of the Tao.
Though it is small, whoever in exercise of this method, will make no man in the world daring to treat him as a servant.
If the duke or the king knows to exercise this method; all existence will express obedience and loyalty to him.
Heaven and Earth unite and send down sweet dew which without the direction of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord.
As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a way.
When it once has that way, men can know to rest in it.
When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error.
The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of great rivers and sea to streams and valleys.
