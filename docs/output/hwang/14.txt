Lao Tze says,
Something which we look at, and cannot see, shall be called 'invisible'.
Something to which we listen, and cannot hear, shall be called 'inaudible'.
Something which we seize, and cannot grasp, shall be called 'intangible'.
These things are not available to be researched for realization when taken singly;
hence when we unite them again, we obtain the true one.
Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure.
It works in its way perpetually without an end, but we can't know its motive.
Then this can be traced in the state of nothingness.
This is called the form of formlessness, and semblance of nothingness;
this is called the fleet of indeterminable.
We can neither retrace to see its beginning, nor can we expect to see its end.
When we hold the primordial Tao, we can rule today's being.
Since we can know the beginning of Heaven and Earth, we know the outline of the Tao.
