Lao Tze says,
A variety of colors (five colors) can blind the eyes.
A variety of sounds (five tones) can deafen the ears.
A mixture of flavors (five flavors) can vitiate the mouth of taste.
Hunting and horse chasing will make men's minds wild with excitement.
Goods hard to procure will bring character with harm.
Hence, the sage seeks to satisfy one's belly, rather than one's eyes.
Of the former one he does approve, of the latter he does reject.
