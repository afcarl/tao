Lao Tze says,
The Tao is the one to give existence;
and its attribute, the Teh, is responsible for nurturing it.
In this way all things are formed.
They are brought forth to maturity according to their condition.
Therefore, all existence without exception honors the Tao and exalts the Teh.
This honoring of the Tao and exalting of the Teh is not decreed through an authority, but through spontaneous tribute.
So it is that the Tao gives existence;
and its attribute, the Teh, completes, matures, maintains and shelters.
It gives life but doesn't claim the possession of it.
It carries all things through their processes but does not boast its ability.
It brings them to maturity, but does not control them.
This is called the mystic virtue.
