Lao Tze says,
The people do not fear death;
what purpose is in trying to frighten them with death?
Supposing the people are afraid of death;
I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death.
Who would dare to do wrong?
There is a regular one who presides over the execution of death.
He who would execute death on behalf of the executioner is what is described as chopping wood on behalf of the great carpenter.
Seldom is it that he who undertakes the chopping on behalf of the great carpenter does not hurt his own hands.
