Lao Tze says,
Honor and disgrace alike give rise to fear,
because this is the fear that the great calamity might fall upon the corporeal self.
What is honor?
And what is disgrace?
Honor means that he who was low before has been promoted.
Since he has been promoted, he is afraid of losing his promotion, which is disgrace.
Thus he who has been promoted lives in fear that he may be degraded.
And he who has been degraded is haunted by the dread that his degradation may last forever.
That is why honor and disgrace alike give rise to fear.
What is the meaning of fearing the great calamity coming upon the corporeal self?
How we can sense that the great calamity is due to the fact that we inherit corporeal self.
If we don't inherit the corporeal self, what kind of calamity can afflict us?
Therefore,
one who has regard for his personal health is more important than he who governs the world, and is eligible to be trusted with the world;
one who loves himself should be put before he who governs the world, and is qualified to be handed over the world.
