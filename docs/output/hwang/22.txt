Lao Tze says,
Be bendable, you will assure wholeness.
Be wronged, you will be proven right.
Be empty, you will be filled.
Be worn out, you will be renewed.
The scanty deserves to gain.
The superfluous becomes lost.
Thus the sage insists on recommending the true one for the world to model after.
A man sees clearly, because he doesn't claim self-righteousness.
A man gets credit because he doesn't boast his merit.
A man has longevity because he doesn't claim importance.
Therefore I say that whosoever gives up a contest, there will be no one who can compete with him.
The ancient epigram goes like this:
Be bendable, you will assure the wholeness.
Is this an airy saying?
Actually, this saying has already preserved many men.
