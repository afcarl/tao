Lao Tze says,
A man who wants his opponent to become a greedy man should allow him the chance to expand his benefit first.
He who wants to weaken his competitor should let his ambitions grow first.
He who wants to demolish his adversary should let him achieve first.
He who wants to plunder his enemy should let him have the storage place first.
These are subtle but effective stratagems.
The feeble will overcome the strong.
But fishes shouldn't leave the deep; a state's strategy shouldn't be shown to any person who is not concerned with it.
