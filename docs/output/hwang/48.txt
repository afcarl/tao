Lao Tze says,
He who devotes himself to learning from day to day increases his knowledge.
He who devotes himself to the Tao from day to day diminishes his intention.
He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing without intention.
Having arrived at this point of doing without intention, there is nothing left undone.
He who manages the world's affairs does so by giving himself no trouble.
If he troubles himself, he is not qualified to manage the world's affairs.
