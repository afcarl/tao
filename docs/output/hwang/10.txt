Lao Tze says,
By clothing a good frame and embracing the holy one, cannot your soul be kept from leaving?
In concentrating the breath and making the body supple, can't you turn into a baby again?
By taking the eyes' dirt and consulting scriptures, can't you become blemishless?
To love people and exercise government, can't this be kept from being publicly known?
Cannot your mouths, eyes, and ears, the gate of Heaven remain soft when opening and closing as females usually do?
When you understand the truth and fully discern them, do you not depend on acting without the intent to control fate?
The one which gives all things' lives, and thus rears them, gives the lives, but does not claim ownership;
it works laboriously for them, but does not expect reward in return.
Even when they are fully grown up, it does not dominate them.
I shall say this really can be regarded as the mystic virtue.
