Lao Tze says,
The skillful traveller leaves no wheel track;
the skillful speaker makes no slip of the tongue;
the skillful reckoner uses no tallies;
the skillful closer needs no bolts, while it is impossible to open what he has shut;
the skillful binder uses no strings or knots, while it is impossible to loosen what he has bound.
In the same way the sage is always skillful at saving men, and there is no rejected person;
he is always skillful at saving things, and there is no rejected thing.
This is called 'procuring enlightenment.'
Therefore the man of skill is a master of he who has no skill;
and he who has no skill is the servant of he who has skill.
If one does not value his master, and the other does not love his servant, intelligent as they are, they might be perplexed.
