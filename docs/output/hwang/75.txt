Lao Tze says,
The people suffer from hunger because their superior agencies have imposed a heavy tax, thus they are hungry.
The people are difficult to govern because their superior agencies are too fond of meddling, thus they are difficult to govern.
The people make lightly of dying because of the excessive costs in seeking the means of living, thus they think lightly of dying.
Therefore the benevolent should be those who do not interfere with people's living;
instead of those who value people's living.
