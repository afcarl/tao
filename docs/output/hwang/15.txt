Lao Tze says,
The Tao-practitioners of old times had subtle wisdom and depth of understanding, and could comprehend the will of Heaven.
They were so profound that they could not be understood:
I will make an effort to describe what sort of men they appeared to be.
Cautiously observed, they were like those in enemy territory;
dignified like a guest;
self-effacing like ice that is melting away;
unpretentious like a piece of undressed wood;
open-minded like a valley;
and mixing freely like turbulent water.
Who can make the turbulent water still and let it gradually become clear?
Who can settle down the perpetual movement and let the condition of rehabilitation gradually arise?
They are those who preserve this Tao guard against overdoing.
It is through guarding against overdoing that their previous possessions are not lost, and they will again procure newness.
