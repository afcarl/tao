Lao Tze says,
There is nothing in the world softer and weaker than water,
and yet for attacking things that are hard and strong, there is nothing that can surpass it.
For there is nothing so effectual that can take its place.
Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard,
and the weak the strong, yet no one can put this knowledge into practice.
Therefore a sage has said,
'He who receives unto himself the calumny of the nation entitles himself to the lordship of the state;
he who bears the nation's direful woes shall be looked up to as the king of the world.'
Words that are strictly true seem to be opposed to common senses.
