Lao Tze says,
All the people in the world would say that my Tao is too great and that there is nothing similar to compare it with.
Now it is just because of its greatness that nothing similar can be compared with it.
If anything can be found similar to it, for long its smallness has been known.
At the same time, there are three precious things which I prize and hold fast.
The first is charity;
the second is economy;
and the third is shrinking from being the first of the world.
With that charity I can be bold.
With that economy I can be liberal.
Shrinking from being the first of the world, I can become a vessel of the highest value.
Present day kings give up charity, and are all for being bold;
give up economy, and are all for being liberal;
give up following behind, and rush in front;
of which the end is death.
For the result of using charity in battle is sure to be victory,
and firm maintenance of its ground in defense.
Heaven will save its possessor, his charitable attribute will protect him.
