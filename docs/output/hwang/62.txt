Lao Tze says,
The Tao is the refuge for all existence, a treasure to men of correctitude, and a guard of less capable men.
Its admirable words can purchase honor;
its noble deeds can raise a man above others.
The less capable man should not be rejected.
That's why there is the king being selected as the Son of Heaven, and three premier ministers are arranged on their positions.
Although riding chariots pulled by four horses and studded with precious stones is a great honor,
it is even more honorable to ride on a chariot which is made of the Tao.
Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much?
Was it not because it could be found by seeking, and the guilty could be pardoned by it?
This is the reason why the whole world considered it the most valuable thing.
