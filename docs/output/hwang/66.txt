Lao Tze says,
That the reason whereby the rivers and sea can be the lord of a hundred streams is because they know to afford a low level, thus they can be the lord of hundreds of streams.
Hence the sage who intends to lead the people from above has to speak humbly to the people.
He who intends to walk ahead to guide the people has to seek his own benefit after seeking the people's.
In this way,
although he has placed himself above the people, the people do not feel his weight,
and though he has his place before the people, the people will not feel it is an injury to them.
Therefore,
all in the world are glad to enthrone him to be the lord, and do not weary of him.
Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him.
