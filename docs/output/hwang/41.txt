Lao Tze says,
The students of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, try hard to put it into practice.
The students of middle class, when they hear about the Tao, seem to be aware and yet unaware of it.
The students of the lowest class, when they hear about it, laugh greatly at it.
If it were not thus laughed at, it would not be the Tao.
Therefore, I try to give a few words about the Tao-practicians:
Those who are advancing in the Tao seem drawing back.
The Tao's way is even but seems like a rugged track.
The superior Teh is inclusive to anything as a valley.
The purest character seems humiliating.
The abundant Teh seems destitute.
And the Teh is established secretly as a thief proceeding to do his work.
Its solid truth seems to undergo change.
Its largest square does no corner show.
The great masterpieces are slow in completion.
The hugest note is seldom sounded.
The greatest image has no certain form.
The Tao is hidden, and has no name, but it is adept at lending its power and bringing fulfillment.
