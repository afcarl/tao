Lao Tze says,
When the king of men holds the great image, the whole world's people turn to rally round him.
When people turn to rally round him, and do not commit loss and harm, then the world shall become peaceful and secure.
He who takes delight in the Tao, and enjoys it, the true one will stay with him.
The Tao's teaching is as dry as a course of tasteless dish.
It cannot be seen, nor can't be heard.
However, it will never be exhausted in its application.
