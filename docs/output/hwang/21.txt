Lao Tze says,
The great Teh is comprehensive, and it follows the ways of the Tao.
The Tao is that which is vague and uncertain.
Within the vague and uncertain, there are pictures.
Within the vague and uncertain, there is substance.
Feeble and unclear as it is, there is spirit within.
The spirit is genuine, with credibility within.
From ancient times until now, the Tao has never left this world; it lives with and looks after all things.
How do I know the Tao lives with all things?
From their daily conduct I know.
