Lao Tze says,
The softest thing in the world dashes against and overwhelms the hardest;
that which is without form can go through where there is no crevice.
Through this I know that acting without the intent to control fate can be advantageous.
The advantage of teaching without speech and acting without the intent to control fate is incomparable in the world.
