Lao Tze says,
From Tao arises one;
from one arises two;
from two arises three, and from three arise all things.
All things leave behind them the obscurity (Ying), and go forward to embrace the brightness (Yang) and inherit the blending property of the two harmonized polarities.
What men dislike is to be called solitary, unworthy, virtueless;
and yet those kings and princes regard them matching to their status.
So those things are benefitted by being harmed, others are harmed by being benefitted.
While other men have taught their precept, I have my own,
- the violent man shall die a violent death.
I will make this the basis of my teaching.
