Lao Tze says,
He who has manhood's strength and takes upon him the female's feebleness;
his inclusiveness is worthy of being looked up to as the world's dale.
Being the world's dale, absolute virtue will not leave him;
further he will enter into a baby's attribute.
He who has the reputation of the pure, and takes upon him the reputation of the unclean;
he is worthy of being looked up to as the world's model.
Being the world's model, absolute virtue will not be in short, further he will be able to attain extreme bliss.
He who has a glorious status, and takes upon himself a humble situation;
is worthy of being looked up to as the world's valley.
Being the world's valley, absolute virtue is sufficient in him;
he will enter into the state of pristine simplicity.
When pristine simplicity is broken off, it turns to appear in various utensil's shapes.
The sage who realizes the importance of pristine simplicity thereby selects the officers.
Therefore the great perfection shouldn't be cut into pieces.
