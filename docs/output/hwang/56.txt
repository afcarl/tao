Lao Tze says,
He who knows the Tao does not care to speak about it;
he who is ever ready to speak about it does not know it.
Therefore the Tao practician would rather close his eyes and shut up his mouth, in order to frustrate his ambition and untie the confused knot in his heart.
Further, he proceeds to temper his brightness, and brings himself into agreement with obscurity.
Then he deserves to be called the one in accordance with Heaven.
Such a one cannot be treated familiarly nor distantly, rendered with profit or injury, made noble or mean.
Hence he is regarded as the noblest one in the world.
