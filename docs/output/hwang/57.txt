Lao Tze says,
A state may be ruled by measures of justice;
the military force may be handled with tactics of surprise;
but the world is kept in peace by freedom from action and purpose.
How do I know that is so?
Through these:
In the world the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people.
The more assertions are put into influencing the people's thinking, the greater chaos there is in the state.
The more acts of crafty dexterity men possess, the more cunning things are produced.
The larger the number of statues displayed, the more thieves and robbers there are.
That is why a sage has said,
'I will do by acting without intent to control fate, and the people will be transformed of themselves.
I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will be righteous of themselves.
I will take no trouble about it, and the people will become rich of themselves.
I have no desire, and the people will strive for the pristine simplicity of themselves.'
