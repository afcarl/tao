Lao Tze says,
Men come forth from their mothers' wombs and live;
and they enter dust, and die.
Those men who depend on the three and ten to live;
die by the three and ten also.
Those who were living will be sent to the place of death by the three and ten.
And for what reason?
Because they made excessive stores to perpetuate their life.
For I have heard it is said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not shun the rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land, nor does he avoid buff coat and sharp weapon at entering a host.
The rhinoceros finds no place to fix its claw on him, nor the weapon a place to admit its point on him.
And for what reason?
Because there is no place of death on him.
