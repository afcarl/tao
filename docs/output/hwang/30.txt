Lao Tze says,
If the king assists himself with the Tao, he will not assert his mastery in the world by force of arms.
He always seeks a consummate result.
Whenever a host has encamped, there will be briars and thorns grown.
In the sequences of great armies there are sure to be bad years.
The skillful ruler knows to attain a good result, he doesn't dare continue his operations to complete his mastery.
In anticipating a good result, being self-opinioned is not appropriate.
In anticipating a good result, take action only when there is no alternative course.
In anticipating a good result, being masterful is not appropriate.
When things have attained strong maturity, they become old.
This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao.
And what is not in accordance with the Tao soon comes to an end.
