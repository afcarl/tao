Lao Tze says,
When Heaven and Earth proceed their works, they do not consider benevolence,
they regard all things as straw-made dogs.
When the sage proceeds his work, he does not consider benevolence,
he regards all people as straw-made dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth, space functions like a blacksmith's bellow.
It is void, but is not out of function.
Once it is set in motion, a continuous stream of production will issue from it.
And the people who like to talk face the same consequence;
the more they talk, the more shortage others will know.
There is no better way than to model after the Tao, and keep oneself in the void state also.
