Deep grievances can be ameliorated, but residual ones remain.
How can this situation be improved?
Thus:
The sage holds the left half of the debt instrument, and never abuses the debtor.
A person of virtue just keeps the left portion; but
A person of no virtue abuses the debtor.
The way of Heaven is neutral,
But it always sides with the virtuous person.
