Tao created the One;
The One produced the Two;
The two produced the Three;
And the Three produced all things.
All things carry the Yin (female) and embrace the Yang (male),
Harmony is achieved through interaction of these prime energies.
People hate to be orphans, widowers, or being destitute,
Yet kings and barons call themselves by these terms.
Thus:
One my gain by losing first, and
One my lose by gaining first.
What people teach I can also teach.
“A violent person would not die a natural death,”
Shall be my first lesson.
