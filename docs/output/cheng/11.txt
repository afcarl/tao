Thirty spokes are joined around the wheel's hub,
Its non-being makes the carriage useful.
Clay is molded to make a pot,
Its non-being provides the utility.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room,
Their utility is furnished by non-being.
Therefore,
Being only facilitates, non-being provides utility.
