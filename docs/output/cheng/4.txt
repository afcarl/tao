Tao is empty, yet forever inexhaustible.
It is so far-reaching, the source for everything.
Blunting sharpnesses, resolving conflicts, softening lights.
It thus harmonizes the dusty world.
So deep and profound,
It has forever existed.
I do not now whose child it is,
It has existed before the notion of god.
