When the world knows what beauty is, then there is ugliness;
When the world knows what good is, then there is evil.
Thus:
Being and Non-being produce each other,
Difficult and easy complement each other,
Long and short calibrate each other,
High and low contrast each other,
Music and noise harmonize each other, and
Front and back accompany each other.
Therefore the sage chooses to:
Manage affairs by taking no action;
Teach without words;
Allow all things to develop, but no to start;
Produce, but not to possess;
Care for, but not to master;
Complete work, but not to claim credit,
By not claiming credit, his credit will not be lost.
