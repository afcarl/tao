The five colours may blind one's eyes;
The five tones may deafen one's ears;
The five flavours may dull one's taste;
Racing and hunting may madden one's mind;
Rare commodities may prompt people's illicit activities.
Therefore,
The sage emphasizes the essentials of life, not the superficial temptations.\So he accepts this and rejects the other.
