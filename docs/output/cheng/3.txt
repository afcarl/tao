Do not ennoble achievers, so the people will not become contentious;
Do not value rare commodities, so the people will not be tempted to steal;
Do not display temptations, so the people's minds will not be disturbed.
Therefore, a wise ruler would:
Humble the people's minds;
Fill their stomachs;
Weaken their ambitions, and
Strengthen their bodies.
Always keep the people ignorant and devoid of desire,
Even the cunning ones dare not agitate.
Achieve the ideal of taking no action,
Then there will be no misgoverned state.
