My teachings are very easy to understand and very easy to practice.
But the world cannot understand them, nor practice them.
There are:
Principles in my teachings, and
Philosophy governing my undertakings.
Simply because of ignorance, people do not understand me.
Those who do are few, those who practice my teachings are rare.
Thus the sage is clothed in rags but hides a precious jade inside.
