Credible words are not artful:
Artful words are not credible.
An objective person does not argue;
A person who argues is not objective.
He who knows the truth may not be erudite;
He who is erudite may not know the truth.
The sage does not hoard for himself,
The more he benefits others the happier he becomes,
The more he gives away to others the wealthier he feels.
The way of Heaven; benefits all, harms none.
The way of the sage: be helpful to all, contentious against none.
