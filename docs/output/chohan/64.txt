Do a non-deed,
Do a non-action,
Taste tastelessness.
The sage desires non-desire,
And does not value anything rare.
He learns the unlearnable,
But peruses what others have discarded.
Thus he enables all things
To develop in their natural way,
And he does not engage in hasty action.
See the small as big,
See the little as a lot.
Take care of the difficult when it is still easy,
Take care of the big when it is still small.
All difficult things in the world begin as easy things,
All big things in the world begin as small things.
The tree whose trunk cannot be encircled by a man's arms began as a sapling,
A nine-story tower rose from a heap of dirt,
A thousand-mile journey began with the earth under a man's foot.
Therefore the sage does not try to do big things,
And in that way can achieve greatness.
The person who makes casual promises
Will not keep them.
The person who perceives many things as easy
Will encounter many difficulties.
Therefore the sage perceives things as difficult,
And consequently never encounters difficulties.
