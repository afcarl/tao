The person who is blessed with great virtue can be compared to a child.
He will not be bitten by an insect or a snake,
He will not be devoured by wild animals,
Birds of prey will not swoop down on him.
His bones are fragile, his tendons soft, but his grip is strong.
He is not familiar with the union of man and woman, but he possesses reproductive powers.
This means that he is at the peak of his vitality.
He can weep all day and not become hoarse.
This means that he is in perfect harmony.
Being familiar with this harmony brings him closer to eternity,
Being familiar with eternity enables man to attain enlightenment.
Increasing life invites trouble,
Let your heart become addicted to the breath of the spirit, and you will be filled with potency.
