It is natural to be frugal with words.
A gale will not blow for an entire morning;
Pelting rain will not fall for a whole day.
Who causes all those?
Heaven and earth.
If (the fruit of) heaven and earth cannot last forever,
How can man?
The person who follows the Tao,

When a person follows the Tao,
The Tao looks kindly upon him.
When the person adheres to virtue,

When the person adheres to vice,
