The person who helps a ruler of men with the Tao
Does not force the world with weapons.
He aims only to redeem the Tao,
And does not attempt to force his strength on others.
Bringing redemption, he does not attribute it to himself,
He does not boast much, he is not proud,
He thinks that it is his obligation to do so.
This is how redemption will be, without force.
When things reach their full power,
They begin their process of aging.
This goes against the Tao.
Whatever goes against the Tao will quickly come to an end.
