The person who pursues his studies
Will be wiser with every passing day,
The person who seeks the Tao
Will decrease with every passing day.
Less and less, he will continue to decrease,
Until he reaches the state of non-action,
And by non-action it is possible to do everything.
Li Chia-mou said:
"He who pursues learning acquires knowledge; he who seeks the Tao casts off his ignorance.
The more the person knows, the more he has to get rid of.
Therefore, adding means nothing more than decreasing."
