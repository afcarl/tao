Although the wise man rules the country with integrity,
And wages war cunningly,
He who wishes to rule the empire
Must not interfere with anything.
His wish is unattainable in any other way.
How do I know this?
Thus:
The more limitations and prohibitions there are,
The more poor people there will be.
The more weapons people possess,
The more riots there will be throughout the country.
The more artists and artisans there are among the people,
The greater the desire to create things that belong to the imagination.
The more rules and regulations there are,
The more robbers and thieves there will be.
Therefore the sage says:
When I choose non-action of my own accord,
The people reach the path of their own accord.
When I love peace and quiet of my own accord,
The people behave with integrity of their own accord.
When I desist from all occupation of my own accord,
The people become very wealthy of their own accord.
When I am free of all desire of my own accord,
The people remain simple of their own accord.
