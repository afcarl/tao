Superior virtue is not aware of being a superior virtue,
So it has virtue.
Inferior virtue never discards the virtue,
Therefore it has no virtue.
Superior virtue seems inactive, but it does everything.
Inferior virtue operates, but ultimately its work is incomplete.
Superior love operates without motive.
Superior justice operates without motive.
The superior system operates, even though nothing responds to it at first,
And gradually people raise their arms and join it.
Thus, when the Tao is lost, virtue is lost.
If virtue is lost, love is lost.
If love is lost, justice is lost.
If justice is lost, the superior system comes into being.
The superior system, therefore, is the expression of impatience and disloyalty, the result of confusion of the senses.
Knowledge that contains no knowledge is only the flower of Tao and the beginning of folly.
Therefore, the truly great person keeps the concrete and rejects the transient,
He keeps the fruit and does not take the flower.
Therefore he rejects the flower and takes the fruit.
