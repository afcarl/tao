Among things, these are the ones that received the One in ancient times:
Heaven, that is made clear by the One,
Earth, that is stabilized by the One,
The soul, that is made spiritual by the One,
The valley, that is made full by the One.
Through the One, all things came into being and were realized,
Princes and kings, through the One, became rulers of the world.
If heaven were not clear, it could tear,
If earth were not stable, it could collapse,
If the soul were not active, it could dissolve,
If the valley were not full, it could dry up.
If things did not exist, they would be as if they had never been,
If princes and kings did not rule,
They would be thrown from their thrones.
The nobleman must measure himself in terms of the humble and simple man,
The dignitary must use the lowly as his basis.
Therefore, princes and kings call themselves "ignorant," "cowardly," "worthless."
Does that not mean that they consider humility to be the root of their nature?
For what does a person hate more than "ignorant," "cowardly," or "worthless"?
Yet princes and kings still choose these words to describe themselves.
Therefore there is no exaltation in this dignitary.
Thus kings rise by lowering their value,
And disappear by raising their value.
It is not good to be conspicuous, like a single gemstone,
Or monotonous and invisible like one of the countless stones in a field.
