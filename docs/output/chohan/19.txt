Abandon learning,
And grief and sorrow will no longer be known.
Abandon learned volumes, cast off wisdom,
And people will be one hundred times better off.
Abandon righteousness, cast off justice,
And people will return to filial duty and birthing offspring.
Abandon cunning, cast off avarice,
And bandits and thieves will disappear from the earth.
These four principles, even if they form the foundation of human culture, are not sufficient.
Therefore, here are principles to which people can adhere:
Show integrity, adhere to simplicity,
Restrain selfishness, curtail lusts.
