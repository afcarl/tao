As far as weapons are concerned, they are instruments of suffering.
They are not the instruments of the man of Tao.
For the actions of weapons will be repaid:
In a place where armies are stationed, only thorns and thistles grow.
Years of misery always accompany great wars.
When the man of Tao stays at home,
His left is his place of honor,
And when using weapons,
His right is his place of honor.
He uses weapons
Only when he cannot avoid doing so.
He does not rejoice in his conquests.
If he rejoices in his conquests,
It means that he enjoys killing and slaughter.
The person who enjoys killing people,
Cannot realize his aspirations in the world.
In matters of bringing honor, the place of honor is on the left;
In the opposite matters, the place of honor is on the right.
The adjutant-general takes his place on the left,
The general's place is on the right,
And this means that it is a funeral procession.
The slaughter of many people leads to deep and protracted mourning.
Victory in battle is immortalized in a funeral procession.
