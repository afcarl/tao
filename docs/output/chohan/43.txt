When the learned scholar hears the Tao
He makes every effort to master it.
When the mediocre scholar hears the Tao
It will seem as if he grasps and loses it, alternately.
When the weak scholar hears the Tao
He laughs wildly,
If he had not laughed at it, it would not be worthy to be Tao.
Therefore it is written:
"The enlightened Tao seems dark,
The advanced Tao seems backward,
The direct Tao seems obscure,
The most exalted quality looks like a valley,
The most pristine white looks colorless,
The most superior virtue looks insufficient,
The most solid quality is like a fragile stalk,
The simplest nature looks changeable,
The largest square has no angles,
The largest vessel is never whole,
The loudest sound is hardly heard,
The largest image cannot be imagined.
Tao, since it is hidden, is nameless."
But only the Tao can improve and mend.
To separate is to be constructive; to be constructive is to be destructive.
All things, whether they are constructive or destructive, lead to the One again.
