When the government is indifferent and inactive,
The people will be happy and wealthy,
When the government discriminates and divides,
The people will be restless and dissatisfied.
Happiness is borne on the back of sorrow,
Sorrow dwells beneath happiness.
Therefore, who can know the virtues of good government?
Only when the government does not rectify anything.
Otherwise, the rectification becomes a strategy,
And good becomes evil.
People have been aware of this for a long time.
Therefore the sage is square and does not cut others,
He has a point, but he does not pierce others,
He is straight, but he does not straighten others,
He shines, but he does not dazzle others.
