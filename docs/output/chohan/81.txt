He who knows does not speak,
He who speaks does not know.
He who speaks the truth is not arrogant,
He who is arrogant does not speak the truth.
He who has good qualities does not argue,
He who argues does not have good qualities.
He who has learned a lot does not know,
He who knows has not learned a lot.
Therefore the sage does not display his qualities.
