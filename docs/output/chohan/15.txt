Long ago, the man of Tao was learned, incisive,
And so profound that it was difficult to comprehend him.
Since it is impossible to understand him, I will try to sketch his image:
He is cautious, like a person crossing a stream during the winter.
He is hesitant, like a person who fears his neighbors.
He is modest, like a person who is another's guest.
He is unassuming, like ice that slowly melts.
He is simple, like a log that has not been carved.
He is hollow, like a valley surrounded by mountains.
He is dim, like stagnant and murky water.
And who is the person who can clear the darkness until it begins to glow?
And who is the person who can purify the murky water until it becomes clear?
And who is the person who can nudge the stagnant along until it begins to move?
The one who follows the principles does not seek fullness.
Since he is not full, when he falls, he can renew himself.
