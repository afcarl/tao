The person who holds on to masculinity but also preserves femininity
Will be a channel that draws the entire world through it,
And, being a channel for the entire world, will not lack eternal heroism,
And can then return to the purity of his childhood.
The person who holds on to white, but also preserves black
Will be a sign and an example for the world,
And, being a sign and an example for the world, will not lack eternal heroism,
And can then return to the infinite absolute.
The person who holds on to honor but also preserves humility
Will be a valley that absorbs the whole world into it,
And, being a valley that absorbs the whole world into it, will not lack eternal heroism,
And can then return to fundamental perfection.
Fundamental perfection, when divided up, will become vessels of many uses,
And these will be used by the sage, officers, and ministers.
However, in order to be great and ruling and supreme, there is no need for division.
