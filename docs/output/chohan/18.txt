When the great Tao is lost, justice, righteousness and good will spring forth.
When wisdom and cunning emerge, hypocrisy raises its head.
When family ties are no longer harmonious, honoring parents and caring for children still remain.
When a nation is in a state of confusion and disorder, patriotism becomes evident.
When Tao is present, equilibrium is present.
When Tao is lost, the differences between things emerge.
