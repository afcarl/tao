The person who knows others is wise,
The person who knows himself is enlightened.
The person who conquers others is strong,
The person who conquers himself is powerful.
The person who knows his lot is rich.
The person who maintains his path with energy has a strong will.
The person who does not stray from his proper place will have a long life.
The person who dies but does not perish will exist forever.
Feo-tzu says:
"The difficulty in knowing is not learning others, but learning ourselves.
Therefore, the person who learns himself is enlightened."
