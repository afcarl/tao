Govern a large country as you would cook a small fish, gently.
Let the Tao govern the world, and spirits will not roam freely.
This does not mean that spirits will not have powers,
But rather that their powers will not harm people.
They will not harm people,
Nor will the sage harm people.
When neither he nor they harm anybody,
The virtue belongs to both of them.
When the Tao governs the world, the spirits are not known as spirits and the sage is not considered a sage, says Wang-Pi.
