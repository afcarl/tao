Your reputation or your person, which is closer to you?
Your person or your property, which is dearer to you?
Profit or loss, which is worse for you?
Over-eagerness leads to over-spending.
Too much property leads to too much loss.
Therefore, the person who is content with his lot will not know disgrace,
And the person who knows where to stop will never disappear,
He will exist forever.
