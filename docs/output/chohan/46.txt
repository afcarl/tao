When Tao rules the world
Racehorses are harnessed to the garbage cart in the fields.
When Tao does not rule the world
War-horses graze in the meadows on the outskirts of the city.
There is no greater sin than going after what man desires,
There is no greater sorrow than not knowing a measure of contentment,
There is no greater obstacle than falling into the pit of greed.
Therefore, it is sufficient for you to know a measure of contentment in order to know contentment in proportion, so as to satisfy your measure.
