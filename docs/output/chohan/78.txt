The weakest thing in the world can overcome the strongest thing in the world.
Nothing in the world can compare with the weakness of water, whose nature is limp and submissive,
But when it attacks the hardest and strongest of all, there is nothing more efficient,
Since there is no alternative to it.
The weak can overcome the strong, and the soft can conquer the tough:
The whole world knows that, but does not abide by it.
Therefore the sage says:
The person who bears all the disgrace of the country can be the master of the land,
The person who bears all the troubles of the country can be the king of the world.
These are words of truth,
Even though they sound like nothing more than a paradox.
