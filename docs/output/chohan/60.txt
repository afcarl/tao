When ruling people, like serving heaven, the sage acts only in moderation.
Only with moderation can he learn the Tao in an instant.
This study is called "the rapid accumulation of a virtue."
Through the rapid accumulation of a virtue
He can overcome everything.
Since there is nothing he cannot overcome,
No one can know of his superiority.
Since no one knows of his superiority,
He can rule the country.
Since what he does when he acquires everything is identified with the mother, his days are extended.
Thus his roots are deep and his foundations strong, and he knows the way of longevity and immortality.
