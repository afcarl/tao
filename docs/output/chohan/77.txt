Is not the superior Tao like drawing a bow?
The high part moves downward, the low part moves upward,
What is full is reduced, what is insufficient is filled.
The superior Tao reduces the full, fills what is insufficient.
Man's Tao, in contrast, takes from the insufficient and gives to the full.
Who can take from the full and give to the insufficient?
Only he who has the Tao can.
Therefore, the sage does not hoard anything for himself.
The more he helps others, the more he obtains for himself.
The superior Tao does good, and never does evil,
The sage's Tao acts, but never hurts others.
