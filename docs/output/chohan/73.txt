The person who shows courage in a lack of daring will live.
To know these two things means to differentiate between the one, which is beneficial, and the other, which is harmful.
Who knows that heaven loathes one of them?

It is not a tactician, yet it makes plans.
Heaven's net is all-embracing, and its holes are wide,
And even so, nothing escapes its sweep.
