Can you always keep your soul focused
So that nothing can divert it from the Tao?
Can you regulate your breathing
And be as soft and relaxed as a baby?
Can you purify yourself and eliminate the hidden
So that you are free of all blemish and error?
Can you love the people and govern the state by non-action?
Can you open and close the gates of nature
As a woman can?
Can you be enlightened and aware
And penetrate to the depths of everything, without knowledge?
