Be modest, and you will remain whole.
Be bent, and you will remain straight.
Be empty, and you will remain full.
Be worn out, and you will remain new.
The one who has little will receive.
The one who has a lot will be enslaved.
Therefore the sage guards the one,
And becomes a paradigm for the world.
He does not expose himself, therefore he shines.
He does not make a good name for himself, therefore he is known.
He does not praise himself, therefore he is dear to everyone.
He does not glorify himself, therefore his name is on everyone's lips.
And since he does not compete at all,
There is no one in the world who can compete with him.
The ancient ones said:
Be modest, and you will remain whole.
Can these be meaningless words?
Indeed, he will return home whole.
