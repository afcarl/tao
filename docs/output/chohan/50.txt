It is easy to hold something that is motionless,
It is easy to create a mold for something that is not lacking,
It is easy to break something that is breakable,
It is easy to scatter a thing that is small.
Take care of a thing before it happens,
Arrange a thing before it gets out of hand.
The simple man generally fails in his affairs on the verge of success.
Take care of the end as you do of the beginning,
And you will not fail.
