The best of the best is like water.
Water is beneficial to everything,
And does not demand anything for itself in return.
Water stays in places where nothing else stays.
Therefore, water is close to Tao.
At home, it is important for this to be a good place to live in.
In feeling, examine the depths of your heart.
In friendship, maintain good relations with others.
In words, have confidence.
In government, abide by good order.
In trade, taking things easy will be to your benefit.
In movement, use every opportunity.
Since there is no demand for anything, there is no blame, either.
This shows how the sage, the highest level of good, operates selflessly.
He does good for others but demands nothing of them.
He is satisfied with everything.
He does not covet anything that belongs to someone else.
When he serves as an example for us, the world enjoys peace and tranquillity.
