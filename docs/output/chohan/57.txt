Make all the weapons blunt,
Cut everything that is tangled,
Make everything that is shiny dull,
Mix with anything that is as humble as dust,
And this is called absolute equality.
Therefore
One cannot get close to it
Nor can one get away from it.
It is impossible to derive benefit from it,
Nor to be harmed by it.
It does not publicize a person's honor,
Nor does it publicize a person's shame.
Therefore it is the most exalted thing in the world.
