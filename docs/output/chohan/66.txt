The best soldier does not love war,
The best warrior is not bloodthirsty,
The best conqueror does not take part in the war,
The best employer places himself beneath his workers.
That is called the virtue of self-control,
That is called the ability to be helped by others,
That is called the enlightenment that comes from uniting with heaven.
