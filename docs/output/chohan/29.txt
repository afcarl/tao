When a person undertakes to hold and mold the world,
I see that he will fail in this task.
Since the world is an instrument of God:
It cannot be molded,
It cannot be held.
He who tries to mold it damages it,
He who insists on holding it loses it.
Therefore the sage does not mold it, and therefore he does not damage it,
He does not try to hold it, and therefore he does not lose it.
With all things, some move forward while others lag behind,
Some hold their tongues, while others speak a lot,
Some are strong, while others are weak,
Some are on the wagon, while others fall off.
Therefore the sage avoids excess, extremism, haughtiness, lust, and arrogance.
