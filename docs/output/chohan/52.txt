People leave life and enter death.
Life's portion is three out of ten.
Death's portion is also three out of ten.
People who move from the day of birth into the realm of death,
Their portion is also three out of ten.
Why is that?
Because of their futile efforts to seek eternal life.
However, only those who do nothing to prolong their life,
Are better off than those who do everything in order to live longer.
I have heard that the person who knows how to preserve his life
When traveling the earth,
Will not encounter a rhinoceros or a tiger,
And when he goes into battle,
He will not be wounded by a weapon or an arrow.
The rhinoceros will not target him with its horn,
The tiger will not tear him apart with its claws,
Weapons will not find their mark on his body
Where they can pierce him with their blades and arrowheads.
Why is that?
Because he is out of the realm of death.
