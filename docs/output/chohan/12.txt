The five colors blind a person's sight.
The five sounds deafen a person's hearing.
The five tastes dull a person's palate.
Races and hunting trips make a person wild.
Things that are hard to attain are detrimental to a person's conduct.
For this reason, the sage
Prepares his food according to the size of his stomach and not according to the size of his eyes.
He rejects surfeit, and opts for less.
