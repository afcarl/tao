"Honor and disgrace are like fear.
Fortune and disaster are like our body."
What does "Honor and disgrace are like fear" mean?
Honor is located in a high place, and disgrace is located in a low place.
When you have them, it is as if you are in a state of fear, and when you no longer have them, it is also as if you are in a state of fear.
Therefore, honor and disgrace are like fear.
What does "Fortune and disaster are like our body" mean?
We have fortune and disaster because we have a body.
When we do not have a body, how can fortune and disaster affect us?
Therefore, the person who relates to the world like he relates to the good fortune of his body can rule the world.
The world can be safely entrusted to the person who loves it like he loves his body.
