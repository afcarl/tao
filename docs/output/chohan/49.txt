The sage has no self that he can call "mine,"
He turns the self of the people into his own.
I act with goodness toward the good,
I act with goodness toward the bad, too,
And so the good is contagious.
I relate with trust to the person who is worthy of trust,
I relate with trust to the person who is not worthy of trust, too,
And so trust is contagious.
The sage lives in the world in his victory and rules the world with his simplicity.
But when all the people look at him and listen to him,
The sage takes care of them, like a mother takes care of her children.
