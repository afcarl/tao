When people do not fear death,
What is the use of frightening them with the death penalty?
When people are constantly afraid of death,
And we can arrest and execute criminals,
Who would dare to commit crimes?
Only the executioner kills.
To kill instead of the executioner is like a woodcutter taking a master-carpenter's place.
When someone carves instead of the master-carpenter,
He can usually expect to injure his hand.
