A person who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firmly on his feet.
A person who spreads his legs cannot walk steadily.
A person who displays himself cannot shine (like a star in the sky).
A person who praises himself will not be praised by others.
A person who glorifies himself will not be famous.
A person who makes himself mighty cannot excel.
All these, in comparison to the Tao, are called:
"A surfeit of food and an excess of action."
They will be tiresome to everyone in other things, too.
Therefore, the man of Tao is not found in their company.
All these are examples of living in a way that goes against nature.
