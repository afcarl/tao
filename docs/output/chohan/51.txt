The Tao created all things,
The way of the Tao nourished them,
All things emerge in different forms,
Each of them is perfect in the nature of the Tao within it.
Therefore, there is not one among the myriad of things
That does not honor the Tao and cherish its way.
Honoring the Tao and cherishing its way are not dictated by law,
But rather come from within.
Therefore the Tao creates them, makes them grow, nourishes them,
Guards them, lifts them, and protects them.
When all things are created, the Tao does not reject them.
It creates them without owning them.
It operates without depending on them, and raises them without controlling them.
When its work is completed, it does not lay any claim to them.
Since it does not lay claim to them, it does not lose them.
