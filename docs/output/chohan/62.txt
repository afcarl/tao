A great country is like the drainage basin of the entire world,
Into which all the rivers flow,
It is the field of the entire world,
It is the femininity of the entire world.
Femininity always overcomes masculinity with its calmness of spirit,
Which it uses as a means to lower itself.
Thus the great country lowers itself before the small country,
Before it conquers the small country.
A small country lowers itself before a great country,
Before it conquers the great country.
Therefore some lower themselves to take,
And others lower themselves to gather.
The only wish of a great country is to hold on to and keep its endless subjects,
And the only wish of a small country is to engage in many occupations and tasks.
When they both wish to realize their aspirations,
Both of them together,
The greater of them must lower itself.
