Words have an ancestor, deeds have a master.
It is easy to understand my words and practice them.
But all the people in the world do not know them,
And do not practice them.
Since they have knowledge, they do not know me.
When those that know me are few, I am beyond all praise.
Therefore the sage wears coarse woolen clothes but carries jade jewels in his bosom,
He knows himself, but does not present himself,
He loves himself, but does not act arrogantly.
Therefore he rejects the latter and adopts the former.
