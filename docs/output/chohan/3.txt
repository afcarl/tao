If the exalted are not praised, the humble will not put on airs.
When rare things are not assigned a value, the thief has no reason to steal them.
When the desired object is not shown, the heart has no reason to covet it.
Therefore the sage says:
By emptying their hearts
By filling their stomachs
By weakening their ambition
By strengthening their bones,
He prevents them from knowing what evil is and yearning for good, and this also prevents the knowledgeable ones from acting according to their knowledge.
He governs by non-action,
And therefore, there is nothing that cannot be done.
Non-quiet and non-order in the world are caused by ambition to attain the unattainable,
and by plotting to go from the undesired to the desired.
If people would obey the laws of the world the way the sage does, there would always be balance between body and soul, and peace and serenity would abound in the world.
