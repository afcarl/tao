Without crossing the threshold of the gate
It is possible to know the entire world.
Without looking through the window
It is possible to see the Tao of heaven.
The further the person goes,
The less he knows.
Therefore the sage
Knows everything without going through the streets,
Names everything without seeing it,
Accomplishes every task without doing anything.
