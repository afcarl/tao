Heaven and earth do not own all things,
For them, things are like straw dogs.
The sage does not own his words,
For him, all people are like straw dogs.
The hollow space that lies between heaven and earth is like the blacksmith's bellows.
Hollow in appearance, nothing is lacking,
And if it moves, a lot of what is in it moves.
The person who speaks a lot will be exhausted.
It would be better for him to keep his words to himself.
