The greatest perfection looks flawed,
And even so, it never perishes.
The greatest fullness looks empty,
And even so, it will never run out.
The straightest road looks crooked.
The greatest vigor looks like laziness,
The greatest eloquence looks like stammering.
Action overcomes cold,
Tranquillity overcomes heat.
Only through purity and tranquillity of spirit
Can order be imposed on the world.
