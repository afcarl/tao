The manifestation of the great virtue is to follow the way of the Tao.
Tao is a thing that is invisible, inaccessible.
Inaccessible, invisible, and yet it has image and form.
Cloudy and obscure, but there is essence in it,
And this essence is absolute truth, and there is belief in it.
From ancient times until now, it has not lost its nameless name,
Through it the source of all things has passed.
How do I know that the source of all things is in it?
From the Tao.
