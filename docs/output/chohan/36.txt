In order to reduce something, it must first be expanded.
In order to weaken something, it must first be strengthened.
In order to drop something, it must first be lifted.
"In order to take, a man must first give."
This is what is called the wisdom of light.
The soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong.
Just as the fish should not leave the depths,
The sharp instruments of control should not leave their hiding-place.
