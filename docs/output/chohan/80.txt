Imagine a small land with few people.
Even if it contains plenty of vessels, I will not use them.
I will induce the people to respect death, and not to go wandering far afield.
Even if they have boats and chariots, they will not travel in them,
Even if they have weapons and armor, they will not bear them.
I will bring them back to knotted cords instead of writings.
Their food will satisfy them,
Their clothing will please them,
Their dwellings will be full of tranquillity,
Their customs will be full of happiness.
Even though the neighboring lands are within view,
And the crowing of the roosters and the barking of the dogs from there are audible,
The people of that small country will not go there in their lifetime.
