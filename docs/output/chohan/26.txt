Heaviness is the basis of lightness,
The passing is the basis of movement,
Therefore the sage, even when traveling all day long,
Never abandons the baggage wagon,
Therefore the sage, even when surrounded by splendor and luxury,
Is shrouded in indifference that stems from serenity.
How can this great emperor, with a thousand chariots,
Move easily throughout his kingdom?
If he is light, he will lose his basis,
If he is hasty, he will lose his serenity.
Wang-Pi comments:
The light cannot bear the heavy; the small cannot contain the large; the sedentary controls the moving, the one who does not move from his place controls the one who moves from his place.
Therefore heaviness is the basis of lightness, and serenity is the secret of control.
