The great Tao is in everything, both on the left and on the right.
Through it, all things come into being, and it does not abandon them.
When its work is completed, it does not possess them.
It loves and nurtures all things,
But does not rule them.
It never exists, so it can be called small, apparently.
All things return home to it,
And it does not claim to own them,
So it can be called great, apparently.
It never aspires to greatness,
And therefore it accomplishes greatness.
