Devote yourself to the goal of achieving absolute serenity,
Aspire to a state of perfect peace.
All things come into existence,
And we see them return.
Look at the things that bloomed and flowered,
Each of them returns to its source.
The return to the source is called serenity,
Which means following destiny,
Following destiny is eternal, it is eternity.
He who knows eternity is enlightened.
He who does not know eternity runs blindly
To his pain and suffering.
Knowledge of eternity, is all-embracing.
Since he embraces everything, he will achieve greatness.
Since he grasps greatness, he can attain perfection.
When he reaches perfection, he will attain supremacy.
When he is supreme, he will come to the Tao.
The person who achieves the Tao exists forever.
Even if his body decays, he will never perish.
