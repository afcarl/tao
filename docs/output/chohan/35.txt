The person who holds the great thing
Will go through a whole world.
He will go along the path straightforwardly without seeing danger,
But finds tranquillity, friendship, and equality.
The sounds of a tune and the scent of delicacies will cause the stranger passing by to stop.
But Tao, when it is expressed in words, is pure, devoid of all taste.
When someone looks at it, he won't see it.
When someone listens to it, he won't hear it.
However, when someone uses it, it is everything.
