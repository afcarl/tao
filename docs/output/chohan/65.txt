In ancient times, the best Tao practitioners did not use it to educate the people,
But rather to restore them to simplicity.
It is difficult to govern people since they are very knowledgeable.
Therefore, ruling a country by increasing knowledge
Means destroying the country,
While ruling a country by reducing knowledge
Means blessing the country.
The person who is aware of these two ways knows the standard,
The person who keeps the standard in his mind is virtuous.
The highest virtue is profound and broad,
It goes back to the beginning of everything,
And in this way attains absolute peace.
