A tactician in ancient times said:
"I do not dare to act as a host,
I prefer to act as a guest,
I do not dare to advance an inch,
I prefer to retreat a foot."
This implies that he does not muster his armies, as if he has no armies,
He does not roll up his sleeves, as if his arms are not ready,
He does not go out to battle, as if he has no weapons,
He does not fight, as if he has no enemies.
The greatest calamity is to underestimate the strength of the enemy,
For underestimating the strength of the enemy leads to the loss of our treasure of love.
Therefore, when armies clash on the battlefield,
The one that possesses the treasure will triumph.
