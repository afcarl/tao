The good traveler leaves no tracks,
The good speaker leaves no doubt,
The good accountant needs no abacus,
The good builder needs no lock and bolt,
And the door he closes will not open behind him.
The good fastener needs no ropes or knots,
And it is still impossible to untie after him.
Even if people are bad, why should they be rejected?
Therefore the sage is always the good savior of the people,
And nobody will reject him.
He is good to all creatures,
He spurns nothing.
This state is called "to see and to come to the light."
Therefore, good people are guides to bad people,
And many people are like matter in good people's hands.
And the person who does not appreciate his guide,
And the person who does not love the matter in his hand,
All their success comes from blindness.
This is the main principle of the secret.
