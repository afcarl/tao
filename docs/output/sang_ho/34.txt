The Great Dao is all-encompassing.
Its influences pervade all directions.
All living things depend on it.
But the Dao works quietly.
It accomplishes yet makes no claims.
It provides clothing and nourishments
yet does not take command over anything.
Ever aspiring for non-existence,57
It can be called little.
Providing a home to all the living things
yet claiming no ownership,
It can be called great.

Exactly because the Dao never takes itself as great,
It is truly great.
