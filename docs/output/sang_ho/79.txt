Trying to neutralize a wrong with another wrong will never work,
because there is bound to be some wrong left over.

To return grievance or wrong with benevolence is
the way to absolve a grievance.

The Sage only sees to it that what is agreed is carried out;
He will not lay the blame on anyone.
The virtuous one only enforces contracts.
The non-virtuous one imposes his will.

The Way of Heaven will not favor any one in particular,
But it will favor those who do good deeds.
