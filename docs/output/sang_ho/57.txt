We rule a nation with the straight mind.
We deploy the military forces with surprises.
We win the hearts of all under heaven with non-intervention.
How do I know that this should be so, with this:

The more prohibitions that are imposed by the emperor,
The poorer the people become.
The more clever products that people own,
The less clever the nation becomes.
The more people use their tricks and knacks,
The more odd products there are, and
The more rules and laws there are,
It is likely that there are the more thieves and bandits.

The Sage says: "I do not contrive, and people
automatically become cultured and well-mannered.
I keep still, and people automatically become straight;
I do not intervene, and people automatically become rich;
I do not crave, and people automatically lead a simple life."
