The Dao is the deepest learning for all living things,
It is the good man's treasure
and the bad man's refuge.

Fine words attract respect;
Fine deeds make people look gallant.
(Because of such fine consequences that are expected)
even men who are bad
may not be stingy with fine words and good deeds!

On the occasion of the enthronement of the Emperor
or at the installation of three ministers of the state, therefore,
It is far better to follow the Dao (which certainly
will bring good fortune) than to have a jade
disc displayed, leading a chariot of four horses.

In the ancient times those people who value the Dao
do not do so for the consequences,
or in order to achieve atonement for their sins.
For this reason they are truly honored by all under heaven.
