The masters of the Dao in ancient times
had mystical, versatile, and unfathomable understanding.
As it is unfathomable,
Only a proximate description is possible.

They are prepared at all times,
as if taking on a river journey in winter.
They are alert and watchful,
as if they were wary of the surroundings.
They are respectful,
as if they were the guests of someone.
They are accommodating,
as if they were ice about to melt.
They are unpretentious,
as if they were the embodiment of simplicity.
They are open-minded,
as if they were a hollow valley.
They are murky,
as if they were a muddy stream,
They are unsettled,
as if they were an open sea;
They never stopped,
as if they were the winds of the earth.

Is there anyone who can be like
a murky stream cleaning up when given a rest?
Is there anyone who can be like
calm air gathering motion and becoming alive again?
The man who shuns full gratification of their desires,
is the man who has this ability.
He can rejuvenate.
