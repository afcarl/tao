Big nations should be like a stream that flows low.
In relating to other nations under heaven.
They should be like a female animal.
Female animals often lie low and still.
By doing so they win over male animals.

Big nations that take on a lower profile than small nations
will win the adherence of small nations.
Small nations that take on a lower profile than big nations
will win the assistance from the big nations.
Big nations keep low and get what they want.
Small nations keep low and get what they want.
Big nations(with an abundance of land) want to have
a bigger population.
Small nations(with a shortage of land) want to have more jobs.

If big nations keep low, both the needs of big nations
and those of the small will be fulfilled.
