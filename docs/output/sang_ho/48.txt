The more we learn,
The more things are plowed into our minds;
The more we follow the Dao,
The more things are taken out of our minds.

As we take more and more things out of our mind,
We finally arrive at the state of losing the sense of contriving and action.
At that point we be in the state of non-action.
At that point all actions will be done in the state of non-action.

To win the hearts of all under heaven,
We must always leave people alone.

If we do not leave them alone,
We will not win their adherence.
