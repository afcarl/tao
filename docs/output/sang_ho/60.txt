To govern a great nation
Is not much different from frying a small fish.

To govern a nation according to the Dao,
Even the demons will not show their influences.
Not that they have lost all their influences,
But their influences will do people no harm.
Not only do the influences of the evil spirits do people no harm.
The Sage will also do people no harm.
Since demons at one extreme,
through the Sage at the other extreme,
All do people no harm.
We can conclude that the Virtue has perfected its job.
