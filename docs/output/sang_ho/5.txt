Heaven and earth are unkind.
They treat everything like the straw dogs used in sacrifice.
The Sages too are unkind.
In their eyes everyone is no different from a straw dog.

Within the bounds of Heaven and Earth,
There is plenty of space,
Much like there is space within a bellows.
Hollow but unyielding is this space.
The more you work on it,
The more air comes out.

Words are superfluous and soon reach their limits.
It is far better to adhere to
impartiality and the middle way.
