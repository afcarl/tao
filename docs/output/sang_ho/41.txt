Superior men, hearing about the Dao,
Will work diligently under its guidance.
Mediocre men, hearing about the Dao,
Remembers and then forgets about it.

Inferior men, hearing about the Dao,
Laughs and jeers at it.
If people do not laugh or jeer at it,
It is unlikely to be the Dao.

Thus it is said:

Those whose mind shines with the Dao
Appear to be dull and stupid.

Those who make progress along the Dao
Appear to be falling behind.
Those who go astray
Appear to be following the Dao.

The truly virtuous are humble like a valley,
The truly stainless souls appear sullied.
A man with many virtues
appears to be inadequate.
Those who are establishing their virtues
look like thieves.
The truthful look like good quality turned bad,
An infinite space will have no corners.
A man who is a great instrument never
aspires or strives to be such.
A big voice sounds like it is soft.
A big symbol has no shape.

The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Yet nothing is better than the Dao
In lending support and helping people accomplish.
