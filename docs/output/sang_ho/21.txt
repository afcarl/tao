To tell the virtuous from all the others.
You only need one criterion:
does he follow the Dao?

The substance of the Dao is impalpable and intractable.
While it is impalpable and intractable,
It manifests itself in the phenomenal world,
And it is not without substance.

While it is shadowy and empty,
It shows itself in the spiritual realm.
The spiritual essence of the Dao is
both truthful and dependable.

From the ancient times till now
The name of the Dao has persisted,
And it has pleased the wise masters.
How do I know about these wise masters?
I use the criterion mentioned above.
