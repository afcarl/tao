The Dao of Heaven is like pulling a bow.
The top end comes down and the bottom end goes up.
It takes away from those with surplus to spare
and gives to those who are short.

The way of Heaven takes away from those with surplus to spare
and gives to those who are short.
The way of men is just the opposite.
It takes away from those who are short
and offers to those who have more than enough.

The Sage does his work but is not arrogant.
He accomplishes but will not dwell on his accomplishments.
He does not want to show off his accomplishments.
