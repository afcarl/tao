Someone who sets out to win the world and
contrives to make his way will never make it.
The world is holy, and is beyond contrivance and possession.
He who contrives to win will only lose.
He who only aspires to possess will be dispossessed.
The Sage never contrives to do anything and so he fails in nothing.
He never possesses anything and so he never loses anything.

Among the living things, some lead, while others follow.
Some sigh, while others shout.
Some display their strengths, while others show their weaknesses.
Some lend support, while others destroy.
In contrast, the Sage will discard the excessive, the
extravagant, and the extreme.
