The person who through the Dao helps a ruler
Will advise against using sheer military force to conquer the world.
Such military activity will invite its own counter-effects.
For where the military force goes,
farmlands will give way to thorns and brambles.
In the wake of military conquest,
A year of misfortune inevitably follows.

Good results are the natural outcome of good deeds.
They are not achieved by force or contrivance.
In the face of good results,
One must not indulge in conceit;
Nor must one boast about one's success;
Nor must one succumb to pride.
Remember that good results follow the natural law.
Good results are not brought about
by forcing the course of events.

Anything that has seen the prime of its age
will soon get old.
Going past the prime is going against the Dao.
Going against the Dao, one soon perishes.
