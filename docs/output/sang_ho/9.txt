Holding a full load of what you desire in your hands
Is not as wise as putting it down.
Sharpening a knife edge to the extreme,
And it may chip off in use.
To have a house full of gold and jade,
And you will only invite thieves.
To succumb to conceit and arrogance upon getting wealth and status,
In the end you will regret it.
Retire once a task has been accomplished
And you are in consonance with Heaven's Way.
