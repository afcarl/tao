The most gentle and the most flexible of the world
Certainly outperforms the strongest and the hardest.

What appears intangible and without substance
Can penetrate the narrowest gaps.
From this we can appreciate the benefits of not contriving.

The wordless teaching, and the benefits of not contriving,
Certainly find no match under heaven.
