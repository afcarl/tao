People under heaven
see beauty in what they call "beauty."
that way they know of the "ugly."

Similarly people see good in what they call "good,"
That way they know of the "bad."

Existence and Emptiness are concepts
that make sense by comparison.
Similarly, long lends meaning to short, and high to low.
Harmony is produced when sounds combine in unison.
Because the fore goes, so the back follows.

Thus the Sage would not act as if he could act on his will.
He teaches the unspoken teaching.
No word is ever spoken, yet living things thrive.
No ownership is claimed, though Nature begets all creation.
Humility is maintained even as achievement is made.
No credit is claimed even as work is done.
Because no credit is claimed, so no credit is ever lost.
