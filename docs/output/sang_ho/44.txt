Which is the dearer,
Fame or the body?

Which means more,
The body or wealth?

Which can be called an ill,
To gain or to lose?

Greater cost comes with greater craving.
Greater loss comes with greater accumulation.

He who knows what he needs
will attract no dishonor.
He who knows when to stop
will come to no grief.
Such people can have a lasting life.
