In order to fold, one must first unfold;
In order to weaken, one must first strengthen;
In order to banish, one must first establish;
In order to deprive, one must first provide.

The following is called refined understanding:
That the weak will outperform the strong.

Just as fish should stay inside their deep pools.
So the best gadgets and tools of a country
should not be displayed in front of others.
