What makes me know what I know,
And adhere to the Dao
Is the fear of departing from it.
The Dao is level and straight.
Yet people prefer to go on their devious paths.

When the court is busy with granting honors to its dignitaries,
And not caring for the fields that are overgrown by weeds,
While the granaries are empty;
When the officers of the nation dress themselves up beautifully,
And carry sharp swords with an air of superiority and power;
While excessive dining and drinking
go hand in hand with excessive consumption and waste,
You know this is arrogance at the Dao.
This is certainly not the Dao.
