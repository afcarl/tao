There is one universal formula that always works:
The sky had followed the universal formula,
and it became clear.
The earth had followed the universal formula,
and became calm and safe.
The gods follow the universal formula,
and they have become effective.
The valleys follow the universal formula,
and they now harbor copious vegetation and creatures.
The living things follow the universal formula,
and they live;
When barons and kings follow the universal formula,
they become the object of emulation by their peoples.
All these achievements are due to the universal formula.

If the sky were not clear it could be torn apart.
If the earth were not calm and safe
it could burst into chaos.
If the gods were not effective
they could wear out.
If the valleys were not copious
they could become empty.
If the living things could not live
they would be doomed.
If barons and kings could not keep their high and respected positions,
they could be toppled.

The noble must be based on the ignoble.
The highly positioned must be buttressed by the lowly.

Barons and kings call themselves
the "lonely one" the "widowed one", or the "under provided one".
Don't these practices demonstrate loud and clear
that it is through the lowly
that kings and barons hold their positions?

Merely counting the number of carriages
will not give you any carriage.
It is no use showing the shiny look of jade
if the substance is merely an ordinary stone.
