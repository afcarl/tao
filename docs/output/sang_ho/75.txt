People are hungry.
That is because the government imposes too many taxes.
People are difficult to rule over.
That is because the government contrives and wants to do too much.
People do not think much of death.
That is because the government makes life a privilege
instead of treating it as a natural right.

Those who makes living an unconditional right are good
in that they pay due respect to life.
