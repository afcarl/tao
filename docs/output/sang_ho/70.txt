What I say is easy to understand and easy to practice
Yet few people under heaven understand and practice it.
What I preach has a respectable ancestry,
What I do serves a lord well.
Yet few people are aware of this,
And therefore few understand me.
The fewer people know about me.
The rarer and the better positioned
are those who know and practice my teaching.
The Sage is like someone hiding a precious
jade piece underneath his clothes.
