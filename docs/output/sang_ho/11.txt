Thirty spokes make a wheel.
Forget about the spokes,
And we have the use of the wheel.

Working clay in the right way can produce a bowl.
Forget about the clay,
And we have the use of the bowl.

Carve a room off the side of a hill,
Forget about the hill,
And we have the use of the room.

We lay our hands on all kinds of materials for our advantage.
Yet we do not possess any of these materials
when we actually use their services.
