He who stands on tip-toe cannot really stand.
He who takes big strides cannot really walk.
He who sees only through his own point of view cannot see clearly.
He who thinks he is always right will not see the truth.
He who boasts of his own achievements will achieve nothing,
He who is self-contented will not grow.

Such people to the Dao are like those who eat too much or do too much,
They will be fed up with what they eat or what they do.
Hence those who follow the Dao will not fall into the "too much" mode.
