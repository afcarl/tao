The superior good man is like water.
Just as water enlivens all living creatures and
never contests with them,
dwelling in places disdained by others,
So the superior good man is prepared to situate himself where
nobody wants.
In this way he is close to the Dao.

To live on the good earth,
To cherish good thoughts,
To do a good turn to others,
To speak the good truth,
To let good governance find its right place,
To put the good ability to work,
To set in motion the good times,

Such is the way to live without contesting with others.
Such is the man free from complaints and anguish.
