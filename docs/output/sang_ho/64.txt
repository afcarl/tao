When the situation is peaceful and orderly,
Maintaining peace and order is not difficult;
When the situation has not yet developed to a
mature stage, planning to change the outcome is easy;
What is brittle is easy to break;
What is minute is easy to scatter.
We set out to work before problems emerge.
We put things in order before they get out of order.

A tree that is big enough for one to embrace around
it grew from a tiny seed.
A nine-story pagoda begins from a heap of earth.
A journey of a thousand miles ("li") begins with the first step.

Those who work for gain in the end will be frustrated.
Those who hold on to something in the end will lose it.
The Sage never works for gain and so will never be frustrated.
He never holds on to anything so he never loses anything.

People often fail in their tasks when they are about
to accomplish them.
If only they take the same care in the end as they do in the beginning,
they will avoid many failures.

The Sage desires to be free of desires, so he will not
value goods that most people value;
He learns to unlearn,
so he will value things that most people do not value.
The Sage only hopes that all living things will live out their inner nature.
He will not dare to go against Nature.
