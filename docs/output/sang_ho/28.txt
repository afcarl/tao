Keep one's place however humble, while knowing one's
real strength.
Stay low, like the rivers that gather water from the higher grounds.
Be that lowly river:
Depart not from the eternal virtue,
Emulate the unpretentiousness of infants.

Keep one's color, though it be black,
while knowing about the white.
Be an example for the world.

Be an example for the world,
Do not disgrace the eternal virtue,
Emulate the Eternal.

Take the blames from the world without complaint,
Yet never forgetting the need for honor,
Be the lowly valley of the world.
This way, the eternal virtue is fulfilled.
And simplicity is restored.

Simplicity is valuable.
From simple substances we have all our useful tools.
When simple men are used by the Sages,
They become great statesmen.

Great people never go out of their way to make themselves great,
Just as the great artists will not do superfluous things
to draw the attention of others.
