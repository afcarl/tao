The Dao neither contrives to do something
nor abstains from doing anything.


If only the kings and barons would follow the Dao,
all the living things would be transformed.

If the transformed living things
should contrive to do anything,
I would restrain them
with the natural simplicity of the Unnamed.
I would have them freed from desires.
Freedom from desires is achieved by stilling the mind.
Everything under heaven will then fall back into their natural places.
