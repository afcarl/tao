When we cast our eyes upon it
yet cannot see it,
We call it yi (literally "flat", "peaceful", or "delighted")
When we turn our ears to it
yet cannot hear it,
We call it xi (literally "rarefied")
When we stretch our hands to reach it
yet cannot touch it,
We call it wei (literally "infinitesimally small")
Since we cannot distinguish these three,
we equate them as one.

Its upper side does not dazzle like strong light.
Its under side does not dim like darkness.
It is beyond description,
And easily confused as nothing.
Its shape is shapeless.
Its appearance is that of nothing,
We call it the "as if."
When we greet it, we cannot see its face.
When we follow it, we cannot see its back.
(Since reality is impossible to track down)
I should only follow the Path walked by the ancient Sages.
That is how I can deal with situations of the now.
Knowing to follow the way of the ancient masters,
Can already be called following the Way.
