We keep our weight, so we will not lose our roots.
We keep our serenity, so we will not lose our poise.
For these reasons when the Sage travels all day,
he does not part from his heavy luggage wagon.
He sits quietly, untouched by the magnificent views.
What a pity it is then to see the lord of ten thousand chariots
losing his weight in front of his people!
If one loses one's weight, one also loses one's base.
If one loses one's serenity, one also loses one's poise.
