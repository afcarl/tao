The wise ruler treats able men
the same as he would treat others.
In so doing he avoids strife.
He plays down precious goods.
In so doing he discourages the
emergence of thieves.
He makes an effort to stem the
emergence of objects of desire.
In so doing he ensures that his citizens' minds
Will not be thrown into disarray.

Thus the Sage's governance
Satisfies the real needs of people,
While emptying their minds of desires;
Builds up the inner strengths (bones) of people
While weakening their vain ambitions.

He would preserve the natural simplicity
of his citizens'minds and reduce their desires.
In so doing the clever people will learn
that their contrivance will not work.
Because the Sage does nothing but following
the law of nature
Nothing will deviate from their natural and orderly places.
