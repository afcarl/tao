Be after the Truthfulness of Emptiness;
Stick to the absolute stillness of the mind.
You will see all the living things around you in a new light.
You will observe their real, original faces.

All things under heaven with their diversity
shall fall back to their proper places and
shall rediscover their origins.
Going back to one's origin is the same as stilling the mind.
It can also be known as the Rediscovery of Life.
The Life Rediscovered is the Eternal.
Knowing the Eternal is true understanding.

One who does not know the Eternal
foolishly creates all kinds of ills for oneself.
One who knows the Eternal is accommodating and receptive.
Being accommodating and receptive is giving up possessiveness.
Giving up possessiveness, one becomes kingly and enlightened.
To be kingly and enlightened is heavenly;
To be heavenly is to follow the Dao.
Following the Dao one will become immortal.
Such a man will never die even though his body passes away.
