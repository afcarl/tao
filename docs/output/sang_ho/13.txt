When the emperor bestows his favors,
one feels wary;
When the emperor unleashes his anguish,
one also feels wary.
In the same light we should be wary of our body.

Why is it that favor, or anguish from the emperor
makes us wary?
Because we are under him, it is natural
that we are wary when we gain or lose his favor.

Why is it that we should be wary of our bodies?
If we own our body, it is natural
that we are wary if something should happen to our bodies.
If we disown our bodies, there will be nothing to fear!

We should give our bodies up to the world,
As if they could be entrusted to all under heaven.
Love is based on giving our bodies up to the world,
As if they could be entrusted to all under heaven.
