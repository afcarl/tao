Just as the five colors that we see can blind us,
So the five sounds that we hear can deafen us,
And the five tastes that we taste can dull our sense of taste.

As we hunt and chase after a moving target, our minds go wild.
So goods that are difficult to get
become hurdles in our life journey.

For this reason the Sage seeks to fill only the true needs("the needs of the
stomach")
Rather than to satisfy his senses("the needs of the eyes").
He gives up the one,
And gains the other.
