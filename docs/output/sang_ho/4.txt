The Way (Dao) is like water that simmers slowly,
Perpetually emitting its energy without boiling over.

It is like a deep, deep pool in the mountains,
Unfathomable yet could well harbor the origin of all life forms.

It can blunt sharp angles,
Resolve disputes,
Soften light that otherwise dazzles,
Re-establish concordance where there is discord.
Unfathomable, who would know its existence?

Today I know of no child of anyone
Who resembles our ancient forefathers.
(Who followed the Dao).
