The Supreme stays with the one who is least clever.
Others, who merely pays tribute to the Supreme verbally,
stay further away from the Supreme.
Still others, who fear the Supreme,
are more distant from the Supreme.
Still others, who live in defilement of the Supreme,
are the worst.
There are people who believe inadequately.
There are people who do not believe at all.

Take things easy and spare your words.
When what needs done gets done
People will say "How natural and easy it is!"
