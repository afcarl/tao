Fine weapons are ominous objects
And are detested by all living things.
For this reason the man who follows the Dao
will stay away from them when possible.

The refined man respects life in his daily life.
(he "follows the left").
If he should resort to military force, he unavoidably
destroys life (he "follows the right").

Weapons are ominous objects and are never
the instruments of a refined person.
If ever he cannot avoid using them,
he must not make a big thing out of it.
Even if he wins the war,
he must not glorify the victory.
He who glorifies military victories
takes pleasure in killing.
He who takes pleasure in killing
will not win the support of the world.

Auspicious events are symbolized by the left;
Ominous events are symbolized by the right.
The next-in-command should take the left seat;
The chief-in-command should take the right seat.
This is to say that a military victory should be
treated like a ceremony to honor the dead.
For those who kill, let us shed our tears upon them.
Upon winning a war, let us pay tribute to
those who die with the rites of mourning.
