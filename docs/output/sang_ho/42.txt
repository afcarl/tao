The Dao gives birth to the One.
The One gives birth to the Two(yin and yang).
The Two give birth to the Three(heaven, earth, and man).
The Three give birth to all things as we know them.
All living things bear the female nature
And espouse the male nature.
In interacting with each other
these two natures result in a new harmony.

It is well known that people generally hate
to be lonely, widowed, or under-provided.
Yet kings and people who wield power
call themselves lonely, widowed, or under-provided.

Things may benefit people through imposing losses on them,
And may hurt them through bestowing apparent benefits.

I teach the same kind of people that others teach.
But by a single maxim that I teach, that
"Those who use sheer force to make their ways
Will not die a good death"
I should become the teacher of all teachers.
