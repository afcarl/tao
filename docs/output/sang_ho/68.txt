He who can offer wise counsel will not display his wisdom.
He who is a fine fighter will not lose temper.
He who is good in contests will not struggle with his contestants.
He who knows how to use people stays low and underneath them.
This is the virtue of non-struggle.
This is making use of others' full abilities.
This can be said to match heaven
And is really the best art handed down from the ancient days.
