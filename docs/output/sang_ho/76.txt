People at birth are weak and supple.
People at death are strong and hard.

All living things including the trees and other
plants are supple and weak.
When they die, however, they all turn dry and hard.
Being hard and strong is the way of the dead.
Being soft and weak is the way of the alive.

Armed forces that show their strength will not win.
Trees that hold strong against the wind are likely
to be blown down.
To be strong is a disadvantage.
To be weak is an advantage.
