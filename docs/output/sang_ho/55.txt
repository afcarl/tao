To be receptive to the benefit of the Virtue,
Like an infant is receptive to the mother,
One would be spared of the stings and bites
from bees, scorpions, and snakes;
One would be spared of being harmed
by fierce beasts;
And of being clawed by the predatory birds.

To be so receptive,
Then even if one has weak bones and soft sinews
One can grip things firmly.

People do not realize that
the union of the male and female with moderation
Represents energy at its height; and that
Being together all day sounding natural calls
and not losing voice through screaming
Represents harmony at its best.

To know the harmony of the universe is
be congruent with the Eternal;
To know the Eternal is to be illuminated.
To preserve and to promote life is to bring good fortune;
To let the mind take command of the life-breath is to be strong.

Any living thing that indulges in excesses soon gets old.
Indulging in excesses is against the Dao.
Going against the Dao, one soon dies.
