Can you concentrate your mind and soul,
and not lapse a minute?
Can you keep your breath soft and smooth,
just as an infant would?
Can you cleanse the eye of your mind,
and keep it free from a speck of dust?
Can you love your citizens and govern your country,
selflessly and according to the Dao?
If you were asked to guard the Gate of Heaven,
would you be totally impartial?
Can you understand the four dimensions of the universe,
and be free from self-guided reasoning?

To give birth to life, and
To nurture it, yet claiming no ownership;
To act, yet without being arrogant,
To bring up life, yet not determining its destiny:
That is the Mystical Virtue.
