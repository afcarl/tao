When something is bent, it is ready to be put straight;
When someone is wronged, one is ready to be redressed;
When a container is empty, it is ready to be filled;
When something gets old, it is ready to be renewed;
When you have just a little, you are ready to get more;
When you have got a lot, you are ready to be confused.

For this reason the Sage espouses one universal formula.
Do not be prejudiced by your own views, and your will see;
Do not think that you are right, and you will know the truth;
Do not boast about your achievements, and you will achieve;
Do not be self-contented; and you will grow.
Because (in-seeking growth) one never need to struggle
or to contest with others,
One will never need to fear that one's achievements will be
contested away by others.

The ancient saying that "When something is bent it is
ready to be straightened" certainly is not idle talk.
To be whole, just follow the one formula.
