The reason why the great rivers and the seas can claim
to be the kings of the hundred valleys
is that they lie low,
so the water in all valleys come to them.

The Sage who wants to be on top of his people must use humble words.
He who wants to lead his people must follow his people.
For these reasons, though the Sage is on top of his people,
his people are not burdensome.
Although he is ahead of his people,
his people will do him no harm.
He wins the heart of his people and
is never abandoned by the people.
Because he never struggles with anyone for favor,
none under heaven can out-struggle him.
