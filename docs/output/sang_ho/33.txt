He who knows others is wise,
He who knows himself is wiser.
He who conquers others is strong.
He who conquers himself is stronger.

He who knows what is adequate lives a rich life.
He who overcomes difficulties knows what he wants.
He who will not lose his place endures.
He who dies and yet lives lasts.
