For a small country with a small population,
Let there be no need to use labor-saving gadgets.
Let people love to die where they are born
and not want to migrate to a distant land.
Let there be no need to use boats for long trips.
Although the country has armed forces ready to protect the country,
Let there be no need to display the military strength.
Let the people find happiness in a simple life.

Let people enjoy their good foods and fine clothing.
Let them settle down peacefully and follow their traditions happily.
Let neighboring nations eye one another,
and hear the calls of poultry and dogs from the other nation.
Let their people find sufficiency in their own lands.
Till their death let there be no need to interact.
