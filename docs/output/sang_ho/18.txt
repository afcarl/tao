When the Way has been abandoned,
The talk about kindness and fairness emerges.
When clever people abound,
Fraudulence and pretentiousness become commonplace.

When there is discord in the family,
People will learn to become better parents and better children.
When the country falls into disarray,
Ministers who faithfully serve the country arise.
