Truly reverence-inspiring
is he who displays nothing to intimidate his people.

Do not despise people for their humble residences;
Do not shun them for their modest births.
Because you do not despise and shun them,
They also will not despise and shun you.

The Sage knows himself and frees himself from prejudice.
He treasures and takes care of his own life but will not exalt himself.
He gives something up and gains something else.
