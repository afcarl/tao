The Dao has always been nameless and simple.
Though humble, it is never subservient to anyone under heaven.
Still, if kings and barons would follow the Dao steadfastly
All the living things on earth would benefit and pay them homage.

It is the interaction of heaven and earth
that brings rain to all the living things.
Heaven and earth are not at the command of anyone.
Yet all living things benefit from their actions.

Humans since the beginning of time
have established all kinds of traditions and have named names.
Should they then not know when to stop?
Those who know when to stop know no death.

Just as the rivers and valleys bring water to the sea,
So the Dao brings all living things to the Ultimate.
