He who is brave enough to challenge the Dao perishes.
He who is brave enough to revere the Dao lives.
These two personalities, with their respective harms and benefits,
will invite favor or disfavor from heaven.
Does any one know the reason behind it?

The way of heaven, the Dao, is apt to win benefits
though it never struggles for any benefit.
He who follows the Dao, though he never asks for any favor,
receives the favor.
Results come of their own accord where results are due.
Without deliberating, heaven appears to have its plans.
Although its net appears to consist of course meshes,
No one can sneak through and escape the law.
