In the ancient days the masters who succeed in following the Dao,
Rather than making people clever,
Would spare them from much acquired knowledge.

The reason why people may be difficult to rule over is that
they are too clever.
The ruler who rules with his acquired knowledge
is (likely) to hurt the nation.
The ruler who rules not with his acquired knowledge
is (likely) to benefit the nation.

Knowing the difference between ruling with acquired knowledge and
ruling with original knowledge
Is close to following the right formula.
Being always mindful of following the formula is the mystical virtue.
The mystical virtue is deep,
far from the crowds,
and opposite to what people expect.
Exactly because it is the reverse of what people expect,
it achieves great concordance.
