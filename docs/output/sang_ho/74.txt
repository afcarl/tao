People may not be afraid of death.
Why should we intimidate them with the threat of death?
If people are generally afraid of death,
And we are able to seize the exceptions and to kill them,
Why would anyone still disregard the death penalty?
The Lord of Killing does kill from time to time.
Yet anyone who kills in his place
is like someone who takes the place of the master carpenter
and uses his sharp tools.
It is unlikely that he can avoid hurting his own hands.
