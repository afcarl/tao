Heaven and earth last.
It is so because they do not give birth to themselves.

Similarly the last thing in the Sage's mind
is to propagate his body.
Paradoxically, that is why his body advances.
The body to the Sage is like any external object.
For this very reason his body perpetuates.
Is it not true that because he is selfless,
That he realizes his true self?
