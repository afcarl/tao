In the beginning, before the formation of heaven and earth,
Something had already existed amid the confusion.
This lonely existence was totally independent of anything else,
And it would not change,
It only moved in its own way tirelessly.
Only it could have been the mother of heaven and earth.
I do not know its name,
I would just call it "the Dao."
I could also call it "the great something."
This great something has now about disappeared
from the world as we know it.
It has been getting more and more remote from us.
It has become more and more contrary from the
world as we know it.

The Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The man who knows the Dao (the Way) is great.
In the domain we know there are four "greats."
The man who knows the Dao is one of them.

The great man emulates the great Earth.
The great earth emulates the great Heaven,
The great heaven emulates the great Dao.
The great Dao emulates the great Nature.
