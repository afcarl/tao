Military strategists have this dictum:
"When I am not ready to take the role of the host (defend),
I will take the role of the guest (attack);
When I am not ready to advance an inch,
I will retreat a foot."
This is known as moving but not having a pattern of moving;
Pushing away, but not showing the arms to push with;
Dispelling, but not having visible enemies to dispel;
Taking command, but having no armies to take command over.

The greatest ill lies in slighting one's opponents;
Slighting my opponent, I could easily lose my treasure.

When two armies of equal strength meet in combat,
It is the army that considers itself weak that will win.
