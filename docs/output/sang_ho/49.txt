The Sage does not have a fixed mind different from that of others.
He takes the mind of any of his people as his own mind.
If people are good, I shall be good to them.

If people are not good, I shall also be good to them.
This way I am really good.

If people are truthful, I shall be truthful to them.
If people are not truthful, I shall also be truthful to them.
This way I am really truthful.

The Sage keeps an undiscriminating mind
for the sake of all under heaven.
While people use their eyes and ears to discriminate,
The Sage's mind is always unsuspecting and innocent
like an infant's.
