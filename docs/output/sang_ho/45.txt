The greatest accomplishment appears incomplete,
Yet it can meet the needs of the most demanding occasions.

The greatest fulfillment appears to be weak and restrained.
Yet its use is limitless.

What is most straight appears to be bent.
What is most dexterous appears to be clumsy.
The most skilled of debaters use words sparingly.

Motion overcomes cold.
Stillness overcomes hot.

Clearing up the muddiness of the mind
By allowing it to settle down to its natural stillness,
Will restore all things to their proper places.
