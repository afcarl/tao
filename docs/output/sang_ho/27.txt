Perfect deeds leave no tracks behind it.
Perfect speech leaves no flaws to find fault with.
Those adept in counting do not require counting chips.
Those adept in sealing require no door latches,
yet what is sealed cannot be opened.
Those adept in tying need produce no knots,
yet the strings cannot be untied.

The Sage who is adept in saving people will abandon no one.
He is adept in saving creatures and will abandon no creature.
This is known as the Tradition of the Light.

The perfect man is the teacher of the imperfect.
The imperfect man is the assets of the perfect.
Those who do not value their teachers,
And those who do not take good care of their own assets,
However clever they are, they are really lost.
This is a key point that is often not understood.
