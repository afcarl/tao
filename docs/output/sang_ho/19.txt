When we stop talking about the Sages
and simply banish contrivance and clever reasoning
That is the time people will really benefit greatly.

When we stop talking about kindness and fairness
That is the time people rediscover their natural filial piety
and their parental instincts.

When people forget about their clever ways
and the pursuit of ease and comfort,
There will be no more thieves.

I cannot say adequately about these three things,
So I will add:
See simplicity;
Espouse simplicity;
Reduce your wild thoughts;
Reduce your desires.
When you have learnt how not to learn,
You will be free from worries.
