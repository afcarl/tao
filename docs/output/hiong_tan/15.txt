In antiquity, a person who followed the way of Dao,
Was as enigmatic as he was insightful.
He was also inscrutable.
Because of his inscrutability, I am compelled to describe his demeanour:
He acts cautiously, as if he were wading through a frigid stream in winter.
He conducts his affairs prudently, as if he were fearful of the gossiping of his nosy neighbours.
His behaviour is as majestic and proper as an honoured guest.
His demeanour is as spontaneous as the melting ice.
His character is as unsophisticated as a block of raw timber.
He is as open-minded as a valley.
He is as muddle-headed as a turbid stream.
Who can allow the turbid water to precipitate and gradually become clear?
Who can agitate the stillness and slowly bring vivacity back again?
He who follows the way of Dao does not become swollen-headed.
Consequently, he will endure.
