Do not venerate the intelligentsia,
So that people will not rival.
Do not value rare objects,
So that people will not steal.
Do not display any desirable goods,
So that people will not be tempted.
Therefore, the sage rules the people by
Emptying their hearts, filling their stomachs,
Diminishing their desires and strengthening their bones.
He constantly makes people devoid of cunning and ambition,
So much so that even a rabid rabble-rouser among them
Is not able to stir up any trouble.
By practising non-action,
The rule will be peaceful.
