Dao is akin to an empty vessel.
It is inexhaustible, as if the vessel can never be filled completely.
So deep and unfathomable,
It must be from where all things come forth.
Dao blunts its own sharpness,
Simplifies its own complexity,
Attenuates its own brilliance,
And mingles with the dirt.
Vast and profound, it appears that it could go on forever.
I do not know whose progeny it is.
It was there before the existence of the creator.
