Knowing the excitement of proactivity, you settle for quietude.
Everyone will converge to you like water flowing towards the valley.
Thus, you are like the valley to the world.
Holding fast to the "absolute virtue" (Dao),
You try to return to the pristine innocence of an infant.
You know the benefit of the limelight, but choose to be anonymous.
You set this example for others to follow.
Holding fast to the "absolute virtue" unerringly,
You hope to return to the path of Dao.
Knowing the lure of fame and glory, you choose humility instead.
By your taking a low profile, everyone converges to you like water flowing towards the ravine.
Thus, you are the ravine to the world.
The "absolute virtue" is bountiful.
Finally, it returns to the naturalness of a raw timber.
The natural block once carved becomes useful utensils.
The sage utilises them as leaders.
The system set up by the sage should cause no harm.
