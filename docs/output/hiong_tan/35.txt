When the ruler follows the way of Dao,
People will flock to him.
They become the beneficiaries and enjoy peace and harmony.
Beautiful music and sumptuous foods allure all passers-by.
They linger and then decide to stay.
How is Dao best described?
Dao is tasteless, invisible and inaudible,
But its use is inexhaustible.
