Whether you are exalted or disgraced, you are uneasy.
It is because you are fearful of imminent disaster.
Why should you be uneasy when you are exalted or disgraced?
Being exalted, you feel proud and elated.
In disgrace, you feel shameful and miserable.
Gaining honour, you fear losing it.
Losing honour, you suffer severe humiliation.
This is why you feel terribly uneasy when you are exalted or disgraced.
Why is there a fear of imminent disaster?
The fear exists because you are constantly worrying about when disaster will strike you.
If you can forget about yourself, then there is no fear.
However, if you manage the country with the same consideration as you have for yourself,
Then you can be entrusted for the job.
If you rule the country in the same manner as you love yourself,
You deserve to be the trustee of the nation.
