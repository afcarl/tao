A good traveller leaves no tracks.
A good debater never makes a slip.
A good strategist does not require chips to formulate a plan.
A good leader does not confine his men to ensure that they stay.
A good employer does not need rope to bind his men to their jobs.
Therefore, the sage always assists but never abandons people.
He always aids all creatures and he never forsakes them.
This is called "covert enlightenment".
While a good person could be a bad person's teacher,
A bad person could provide a salutary lesson to a good person.
A learned person remains a befuddled one if he neither values the teacher nor learns from this salutary lesson.
The subtlety of Dao can only be appreciated by an intuitive mind.
