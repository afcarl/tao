The way of Dao operates like the art of archery.
When you aim too high, you have to adjust downwards.
When you aim too low, you have to adjust upwards.
If the tension is excessive, you lower it.
If the tension is inadequate, you augment it.
The way of Dao is to take from the excess and give it to the deficient.
In the human realm, it is totally different.
It is the case of robbing the poor and giving it to the rich.
Who would take from the haves and give it to the have-nots?
Only the people who follow the way of Dao would.
Therefore, the sage does things without ulterior motives.
When he accomplishes, he does not claim credit.
It is because he does not want to appear sagacious.
