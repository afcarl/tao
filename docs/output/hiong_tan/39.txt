In antiquity, the person who follows Dao said:
If the sky is harmonised with Dao, it will be clear.
When the Earth harmonises with Dao, it will be settled.
Similarly, the spirits will retain their magic power;
The valley will be filled with water.
When the ruler follows the way of Dao, his reign will be peaceful.
All these are achieved by following the way of Dao.
If the sky is not clear, it will split.
If the Earth is not settled, it will erupt.
When the spirits lose their power, they will become extinct.
The valley without water will dry up.
All forms of life without nourishment will perish.
A ruler who fails to maintain peace will be toppled.
Dignitaries rely on the support from commoners.
A tall building depends entirely on its base to stay erect.
Hence, the rulers customarily use self-deprecating words when referring to themselves.
Is this not an acknowledgement that everything originates from a humble beginning?
Everyone dislikes words like orphaned, widowed, and unworthy.
Yet, the rulers customarily use these terms to describe themselves.
The irony is that if you crave for fame, you will end up losing it.
The person who follows Dao has no desire to be valued like a beautiful jade.
Nor would he like to be rejected as an ugly stone.
