That which cannot be heard is Xi.
That which cannot be touched is Wei.
All these three qualities can hardly be analysed.
When amalgamated into one,
Its upper limit is not radiant,
And its lower limit is not dull.
It is as nebulous as it is indescribable.
Eventually it approaches to nothingness.
This is why it is called the formless form, or the immaterial material.
This is why it is called the illusory.
Try to meet it head-on, and you cannot see its face.
Try to follow it from behind, and you cannot see its back.
Following the way of ancient Dao,
You will be able to manage your affairs with great aplomb.
To be able to understand ancient Dao
Is to truly appreciate the immutable principles of Dao.
