The person of great virtue is akin to an infant.
Poison snakes and insects will not bite him.
Ferocious animals will not harm him.
Birds of prey will not attack him.
The infant is weak and floppy,
But his grip is firm and tight.
Although he does not knows anything about copulation,
He has a strong erection and this signifies the pinnacle of vitality.
He can scream all day without suffering from hoarseness.
This epitomises that his vital energy is in harmony.
When the energy is harmonised, it is acting in accord with Dao.
If you understand the way of Dao, you have transcendental wisdom.
Overindulgence in life is harmful.
Forcing the body to work beyond its limits is excessive.
Whenever anything reaches its peak, it then begins to decline.
Action that is unnatural is contrary to Dao.
Action contrary to Dao will lead to an early demise.
