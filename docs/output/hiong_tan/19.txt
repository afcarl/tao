If you discard sagacity and wisdom,
The populace will be better off a hundred-fold.
If you get rid of benevolence and righteousness,
Filial piety and doting affection will return.
If you dispense with ingenuity and profiteering,
There will be no thieves.
All these attributes are mere superficialities.
They are not substantial enough to run the country.
There are other ways:
Outwardly, be simple; and inwardly, you should maintain your pristine sincerity.
You should not be selfish or avaricious.
