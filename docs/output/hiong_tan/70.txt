Though my words are easily comprehended and easily followed,
People do not understand and do not want to follow.
My words are based on the principles of Dao.
I also follow the same principles in all my dealings.
Because people do not understand my teachings, they fail to understand me as well.
Few people understand me.
Fewer people follow my teachings.
The sage always dresses shabbily but still embraces the treasure in his bosom.
