When people do not respect the authority,
Legislation bearing stiff penalties will soon follow.
Nevertheless, the ruler should not make people's lives a living hell.
If the ruler is not oppressive, they will not loathe him.
Although the sage is conscious of his ability, he does not show off his talent.
While maintaining his self-righteousness, he does not flaunt his eminence.
He thus rejects parading his eminence, but he embraces his self-esteem.
