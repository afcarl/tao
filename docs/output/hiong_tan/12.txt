Excessive colours impair your sight.
Excessive noise affects your hearing.
Excessive tastes will dull your taste buds.
Galloping and hunting on horseback will drive you crazy.
Coveting rare objects will impel people to commit crime.
Therefore, the sage aims to satiate the people's hunger.
He does not intend to feast their visual desires.
Hence, he rejects the latter but embraces the former.
