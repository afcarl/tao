Get rid of the knowledge and you eliminate your worry.
To say 'yes' or to howl 'yes', is there a big difference?
The concepts of good and bad, are they that much different?
Should I also be afraid of what other people are fearful about?
I am yet to make up my mind on these questions.
Nevertheless, everyone is happy, as if having a great feast or a nice picnic in spring.
Singularly, I am feeling tranquil and imperturbable.
I am as innocently naive as an infant.
Feeling lost as if I have no place to go back to.
Everyone seems to be smug while I alone feel inadequate.
I am just a clod and am very bewildered.
Everyone appears to be dazzling, but I am simply lacklustre.
Everyone is astute while I am befuddled.
My thoughts are drifting and ruffling, like an ocean.
My mind is blowing aimlessly like a gale.
Everyone is striving for success and prosperity
While I remain obstinately inane and insignificant.
I know I am different for I am devoted to the study of Dao.
