Brave and reckless will be killed.
Brave but prudent will survive.
Two different types of bravery have dissimilar outcomes:
one is beneficial but the other is disastrous.
Why Providence dislikes one but not the other is a puzzle.
Even the sage is unable to fathom the reason.
The way of Dao is to accomplish without contention;
To evoke response without utterance;
All things come to pay homage without being told.
Dao does not resort to scheming but its plan is perfect.
The dragnet cast by Providence has wide meshes,
Yet, no wrongdoers ever slip through.
