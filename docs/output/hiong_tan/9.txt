As brimming with pride will often lead to a downfall,
A timely halt is much preferred.
If you continue to hone the blade of a knife,
You will not be able to preserve its sharp edge.
It is impossible to safeguard a house full of treasures forever.
Wealthy people who are arrogantly extravagant,
Inevitably bring calamity upon themselves.
To retire after a successful career is to follow the way of Dao.
