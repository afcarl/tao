From the time you were born, you are dying.
About one-third of people are luxuriating in longevity,
Another third are enjoying a normal life span but travelling along the path towards a natural death.
The other third are heading on the path towards a premature death.
The cause of premature death is due to overindulgence in life.
I have heard that people, who master the art of living,
Can avoid meeting a rhinoceros or tiger in the jungle.
They can avoid getting hurt by any sharp weapons in a battle.
The rhinoceros cannot employ its horn against them.
The tiger cannot attack them with its paws.
Sharp weapons cannot inflict injury on them.
Why is this so?
They simply manage to stay away from the circle of death.
