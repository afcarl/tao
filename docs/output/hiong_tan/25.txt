There is an admixture,
Which existed before heaven and earth.
As silent as it is nebulous,
It exists alone and it is permanent.
It moves around a circle unceasingly.
It is the mother of the universe.
I do not know its name and I have decided to call it Dao.
Arbitrarily, I describe it as great.
So great that it begins to permeate everywhere.
Permeating outwards, it goes farther and farther away.
Nevertheless, it will soon return to its original state again.
Therefore, Dao is great.
Heaven is great.
Earth is great.
Humanity is great.
In the universe, humanity is one of the four greats.
Man models earth;
Earth models heaven;
Heaven models Dao.
And Dao models nature.
