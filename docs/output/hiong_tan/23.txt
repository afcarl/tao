To be reticent is consistent with the law of nature.
Usually the hurricane does not last more than half a day.
And torrential rain does not pour for a whole day.
The wind and rain are the result of the forces of nature.
Even the forces of nature do not endure for long,
So how can human efforts ever match that of nature?
Those devoted to Dao will follow Dao, and those devoted to De will follow De.
On the contrary, those who go against Dao will manifest it in their behaviours.
Following the path of Dao, Dao is glad to accept you.
Following the path of De, De is pleased to welcome you.
Following the alternative path, the alternative entity is also happy to receive you.
If the people in power have no credibility, then the ordinary people will not trust them.
