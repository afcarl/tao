When the government is magnanimous, the people are contented and unsophisticated.
When the government is overbearing and mean-spirited, the people are resentful and miserable.
Whenever calamity occurs, boon is also lurking around the corner.
Whenever good fortune strikes, misfortune is always stalking in its shadow.
Nobody will ever know how things will end in any given situation, as there are no fixed patterns.
Sometimes, a normal affair can turn out to become exceptionally eventful.
Sometimes, an apparently good thing can go terribly wrong.
For a very long time, these things continue to befuddle the ordinary people.
Nevertheless, the sage is always sharp but not cutting.
He is incorruptible but not contemptuous of others.
He is upright and direct but not repugnant.
He is brilliant but not dazzling.
