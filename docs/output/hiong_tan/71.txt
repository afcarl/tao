Knowing but thinking you do not really know, you are a man of great virtue.
Not knowing but thinking that you know, you have a severe affliction.
Because you are aware of this fault, you can then try to avoid committing this mistake.
The sage has no flaws because he is cognizant of this malady.
Hence, he has no shortcomings.
