Dao produces everything.
De nourishes everything.
Dao and De work in tandem and things begin to take shape.
Things begin to evolve according to the circumstances.
Hence, all beings respect and venerate Dao and De.
Dao and De are so venerated because they do not exert control.
Everything is allowed to develop naturally.
Therefore, Dao procreates everything; De nurtures.
De facilitates growth, development, fruition and ripening.
It also nourishes and protects.
Dao procreates but does not possess.
De accomplishes but does not claim credit.
It facilitates growth but does not exert control.
This is known as "inconspicuous virtue".
