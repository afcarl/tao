A person of great virtue behaves like water.
Water benefits everything but does not contend.
It resides at the lowest place that everyone loathes.
Thus this characteristic of water bears close resemblance to the typical trait of Dao.
A person of great virtue prefers to live on the lowest ground.
His heart is quiescent and serene.
His dealings with others are based on goodwill.
His utterances are forever sincere.
His rule is orderly and peaceful.
His managerial skills are superb.
His timing is always impeccable.
Because he is not contentious, nobody will ever hold a grudge against him.
