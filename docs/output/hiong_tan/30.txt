An enlightened minister prefers applying the principles of Dao to assist his sovereign in governing.
He is extremely reluctant to use force to subjugate others.
Using force always has repercussions.
Wherever the army passes through, the land is laid to waste and brambles grow.
After a major battle, there will be a famine the following year.
A moral person will only accomplish his task.
He will not be heavy-handed.
Achieving success, he is not ostentatious.
Accomplishing his task, he does not gloat.
Scoring victory, he is not arrogantly intransigent.
He goes to war in order to achieve his objective, only when he has no other choice.
Even after winning, he does not brutalise the vanquished.
Whenever anything reaches its peak, it starts to decline.
Moreover, excessive use of force is not in accordance with Dao.
Anything that goes against Dao will suffer an early demise.
