In a small and sparsely populated country,
Even if there are many talented military leaders, the nation does not require their services.
People treasure their lives and livelihoods that they loathe to emigrate.
Although there are boats and carriages, no one wants to use them.
While there are armour and weapons, there is no place to exhibit them.
People revert back to ancient way of recording events by tying knots on the string.
Their food is sumptuous.
Their garments are beautiful.
Their lodgings are comfortable.
Their social mores and customs are unsophisticated but joyous.
The neighbouring states can be sighted, and the noises of barking dogs and crowing cocks can be heard reciprocally.
Yet, people will never visit each other, never in a million years.
