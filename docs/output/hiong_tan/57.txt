You should govern a country by moral rectitude.
You should fight a war by employing stratagems.
You should follow the principle of non-intervention to rule a country.
How do I know all these are going to work?
Let us look at the followings:
The more rules and regulations you establish, the more destitute the people become.
The more intense the machination amongst the ruling classes, the more discordant the country will become.
The more cunning the people, the more outlandish things they do.
The more laws you proclaim, the more thieves you produce.
Therefore, the sage says:
"I follow non-action, and thus my people will live harmoniously.
I remain calm, and thus my people become righteous.
I do not meddle, and thus my people become more prosperous.
I have no desire, and thus my people will be simple and contented."
