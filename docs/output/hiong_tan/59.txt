Nothing beats frugality in governing a country or following the way of Dao.
Frugality compels you to get ready in advance.
To get ready in advance means you start to amass virtues straightaway.
The accumulation of virtues will enable you to achieve practically anything in life.
Ability to accomplish anything means you have incredible power.
With this limitless power, you can govern a country.
Governing the country by following the way of Dao, you will endure.
A plant can bear great fruit only if it has deep roots.
Building deep roots is the way to perpetuate.
