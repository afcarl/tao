The great Dao flows everywhere.
It goes to the right and it goes to the left.
Myriad beings depend on it to survive,
But it does not interfere with them.
It facilitates but does not gloat.
It nourishes everything, but does not exert control.
Dao has no goal and appears to be insignificant.
Nevertheless, everything relies on it for sustenance, but it exerts no control.
Such action seems to be magnificently great.
Dao has no intention to be great, yet it attains greatness.
