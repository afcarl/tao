Dao is often referred to as "the nameless".
Although this "pristine simplicity" (Dao) appears to be insignificant,
Nothing in the world can subjugate it.
If a ruler can follow the way of Dao,
Everyone will naturally come to join him.
When Yin and Yang harmonise, rain begins to fall.
Similarly, people will live in harmony without any coercion.
Whenever a system is set up, new terminology appears.
(A new system will bring about new disputes.)
However, it is important to simplify the system.
Knowing when to stop, you can avert a calamity.
What Dao is to the people is similar to what the ocean is to the rivers.
