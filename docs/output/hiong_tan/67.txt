Everyone says that Dao is so huge that it does not resemble anything we know.
As it is so phenomenally huge, it becomes incomparable.
If it does remotely resemble something on earth, then with the passage of time, its uniqueness will evaporate and gradually become inconsequential.
I steadfastly hold on to my three treasures.
These are compassion, frugality and humility.
With compassion, I can arouse real courage from my subordinates.
With frugality, I would enjoy popular support.
With humility, I become the natural leader.
Let us examine the following scenarios.
Demanding bravery from the subjects without showing compassion towards them,
Expecting popular support without dispensing benefits,
And wanting to become the leader without exhibiting humility.
These are negative attributes that will lead to self-destruction.
By applying compassion in war, you will be triumphant in attack and invincible in defence.
When Providence wants to save a nation,
It does so by bestowing great compassion to its leader.
