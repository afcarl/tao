Governing a big country is akin to frying a small fish.
When the power of Dao is prevalent,
Even the demons become impotent.
Although the demons continue to possess magical power,
Their power is rendered innocuous.
Hence, the demons cannot harm people.
The sage also does not harm people.
Both do not interfere with people.
Thus by sticking to non-intervention, both let their virtues merge together.
