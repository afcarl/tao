In maintaining congruity of the mind and body,
Can you prevent your attention from wandering?
Can you breathe naturally and relax your entire body
Until it becomes as supple as an infant's?
Can you clear all errant thoughts and maintain an immaculate mind?
Can you rule benevolently by adhering to non-action?
In watching everything evolve and change, are you able to maintain quietude (a typical female trait)?
Can you learn intuitively rather than analytically?
Dao procreates and nourishes everything.
It engenders but does not claim possession.
It achieves but does not claim credit.
It lets things develop but does not exert control.
This is known as "inconspicuous virtue".
