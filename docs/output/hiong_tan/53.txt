Even if I confidently know that I am on the right path, I will still tread gingerly for fear of deviating from it.
The correct path of Dao is smooth and easily accessible.
However, people still choose to travel on the small paths.
While the magnificent imperial palace is immaculate and pristine,
The paddy fields are neglected and the granaries empty.
Yet, the ruler still dresses elegantly, wears fine swords and feasts in style.
He continues to amass great personal wealth.
This is the behaviour of a chief of robbers.
He is not following the way of Dao.
