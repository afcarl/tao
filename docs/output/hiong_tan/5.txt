Nature is impartial;
It treats everything like sacrificial straw dogs.
The sage is also indifferent;
He regards everyone as sacrificial straw dogs.
The universe is just like a bellows.
Though empty and intangible, it is never spent.
The more you use it, the more briskly it carries on.
But to argue excessively will definitely come to a dead end.
It is best to maintain the central core of human nature.
