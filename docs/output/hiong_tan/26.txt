Frivolity should be anchored to solemnity.
Tranquillity should keep a tight rein on agitation.
Therefore, the sage carries out his daily tasks with gravity and equanimity.

How could any national leader behave in a cavalier fashion in governing the country?
In fickle frivolity, he will lose the foundations.
In great haste, he will lose control.
