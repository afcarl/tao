Dao is the safe haven for all beings.
The good people value it.
The bad people receive protection from it.
Words consistent with Dao will place you in a coveted position.
Deeds consistent with Dao will make you stand out from the crowd.
Even if people are bad, Dao will not reject them.
There are important events as such coronation and swearing in of ministers.
In these pompous ceremonies, officials carrying precious jade lead the procession followed by four thoroughbreds.
This largess becomes insignificant when compared to simply presenting Dao as a gift.
Why has Dao always been valued since antiquity?
It is as the saying goes:
"If you seek it, you will get it; if you make an error, you will be forgiven."
Hence, Dao is valued by all.
