When a consummate scholar learns about Dao,
He studies it diligently and puts it into practice.
When a mediocre scholar hears about Dao,
He becomes totally perplexed.
When a lowly scholar hears about Dao,
He instantaneously bursts into laughter.
If it is not sneered at,
It cannot have been the real Dao.
Therefore, there was an ancient saying:
A person who knows about Dao appears to be dull.
A person who is advanced in Dao appears to be backward.
A person who travels smoothly along the path of Dao appears to be on a bumpy ride.
A person with excellent virtue appears to be quite shallow.
A person with immaculate virtue appears tarnished.
A person with great virtue appears to be inadequate.
A person with substantial virtue seems to be flimsy.
A person with genuine virtue appears to be shifty.
The greatest space has no corners.
A prodigal talent takes time to actualise.
The greatest sound is nature's sound of silence.
Dao has no form.
Dao is subtle, obscure, and indescribable.
Only Dao will give generously and help others to accomplish.
