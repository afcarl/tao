If you want to rule the world according to your own whims,
It is unlikely to be successful.
Governing a country is a sacred mission.
You must not be meddlesome or intransigent.
He who is meddlesome will flounder in his job.
He who is rigid and foolhardy will lose the plot.
It takes all sorts to make the world.
Some are leaders and some are followers.
Some are highly excitable and some are calm.
Some are strong and some are weak.
Some feel secure and some feel threatened.
Nevertheless, the sage forsakes excess, extravagance and arrogance.
