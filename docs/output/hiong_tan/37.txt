Dao always sticks to non-action, yet everything develops spontaneously.
If the rulers could follow the way of Dao,
Everything under the sun will function properly.
If desire begins to creep in during the developing process,
It should be constrained by the "nameless simplicity".
The "nameless simplicity" has no designs.
Without designs, it will not create any disturbance.
Hence, peace will again prevail in the world.
