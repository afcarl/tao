He who understands others is wise.
He who knows himself is sagacious.
To defeat others, you are powerful.
To prevail upon yourself, you are resolute.
To be contented is to be wealthy.
To diligently follow the way of Dao means you have great determination.
By not deviating from the path of Dao, you will perpetuate.
When a person dies but his spirituality persists, this is the essence of immortality.
