The ruler with great virtue never reveals his virtue.
Hence, he truly possesses real virtue.
An ordinary ruler deliberately tries to show off his virtue.
He therefore does not possess any real virtue.
The ruler with great virtue goes with the flow.
His action encapsulates the essence of wu-wei.
The ordinary ruler deliberately tries to go with the flow.
He thus achieves the antithesis of wu-wei.
The ruler with great compassion rules benevolently without ulterior motives.
He thus captures the essence of wu-wei.
The ruler of righteousness deliberately sets out to rule benevolently.
He thus misses the essence of wu-wei.
The ruler of propriety (rites) imposes rules and regulations.
When the people do not conform, he responds with punitive measures.
Therefore, when Dao is in decline, virtue supplants it.
When virtue is in decline, benevolence replaces it.
When benevolence fails, righteousness takes its place.
When righteousness does not prevail, rites begin to exert their authority.
The prevalence of rites is the sign that loyalty and trust are wearing very thin and that serious trouble is brewing.
Clever people with prescience to foretell events represent the superficiality of Dao.
This heralds the beginning of ignorance.
Therefore, a man of substance is unsophisticated but not shallow.
He resides on the fundamental but not on the superficial.
He thus embraces the substance and rejects the trimmings.
