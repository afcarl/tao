To preserve your life, you have to be pliable.
That which is bent will soon be straightened.
The lowest ground will be filled by water.
Old and tattered things will soon be replaced.
To gain real insights, you must be focused.
Dealing with too many things concurrently can only lead to confusion.
The sage embraces the essence of Dao.
He thus sets an example for others to follow.
Not trying to be prominent is why he is famous.
Not pretending to be a know-all is why he is distinguished.
Not wanting to claim credit is why he is acclaimed.
Not bragging about his ability is why he has advanced.
Because he is not contending, no one can compete with him.
The ancient saying that to be pliable is to preserve oneself is not just empty rhetoric.
It is through following the way of Dao that self-preservation is assured.
