The world has its beginning.
It is the mother of the world (Dao).
Once you have understood the mother,
You should then begin to learn more about the son (evolution).
While learning more about the son,
You must always stick to the principles of Dao (mother).
Thus, you will never be in any danger in your whole life.
If you block out your senses, you will be calm and insouciant.
If you allow your cognitive processes to intervene with your daily affairs, you will be irremediably mired by harassment.
You have insightful wisdom if you are able to discern the minutiae in every affair.
Adhering to the principle of yielding, you are resolutely strong.
Igniting the spark of intuitive mindfulness, you thus rekindle your insightful wisdom.
Consequently, you will never court any disaster.
This is simply following the way of Dao.
