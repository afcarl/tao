Without stepping out of the house,
You can know what is going on in the world.
Without peering out the window,
You can understand the way of Dao.
The farther you travel, the less you really know.
Therefore, the sage knows without having to travel.
Without seeing for himself, he can understand the law of nature.
Without meddling, he accomplishes easily.
