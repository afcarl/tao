He who stands tiptoed will soon fall over.
He who walks with huge strides will not go very far.
By trying to show off, you will not be eminent.
By acting like a know-all, you will not be distinguished.
If you brag about your success, you will end up with no credit.
If you are conceited, you will not make any further advancement.
From the perspective of Dao,
Even animals will find all extravagant deeds disgusting.
He who follows the path of Dao does not subscribe to these actions.
