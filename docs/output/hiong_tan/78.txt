Nothing in the world is softer and more yielding than water.
Nevertheless, among all things that can overcome the hard and strong,
None is more formidable than water and none can supplant it.
Everybody knows that the soft can overcome the hard,
And the weak can subdue the strong,
But few can put these into practice.
The ancient sage once said:
"A person who can withstand all the nation's insults,
Is fit to be the ruler.
A person who can endure all the misfortunes of the nation,
Is fit to be the king of the world."
Here lies the paradox: truthful words that are candid and self-evident may appear to be "trash talk".
