The ancient ruler who followed the way of Dao,
Attempted to make people simple and unsophisticated, not clever and scheming.
People are unruly because they are too clever and devious.
Using sophisticated measures to run a country, you can only cause harm.
Using unsophisticated measures, you will bring prosperity to the country.
These two models are consistent with the immutable principles of Dao.
Understanding the immutable principles, you are a person of inconspicuous virtue.
Inconspicuous virtue is profound and enduring.
Inconspicuous virtue is the opposite of conventional wisdom.
By going with the flow, you will achieve great harmony.
