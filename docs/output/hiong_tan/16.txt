I strenuously try to banish all errant thoughts from my mind, and assiduously attempt to maintain quietude.
Henceforth, while everything continues to develop and evolve, I silently watch its natural transformation.
Although there are multifarious things in the world,
Each and every one will go back to where it came from.
Returning back to where it came from is called 'jing'.
It is also called 'back to destiny'.
'Back to destiny' is the eternal law.
You have insightful wisdom if you understand this eternal law.
Unable to grasp this will bring about calamity.
Knowing this, you will have great understanding.
Having great understanding will make you impartial.
Being impartial, you generally facilitate others to fulfil their potential. (accomplishment)
Accomplishment is in accordance with the law of nature.
The law of nature is called Dao.
Dao is everlasting.
Following the way of Dao, your whole life will be free from danger.
