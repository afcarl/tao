If you want to contract something, you must first stretch it.
You must first strengthen his power before you can weaken him.
Similarly, you have to build up something first before you can demolish it.
You can only take something away from somebody after they have possessed it.
This sort of platitudes is known as "subtle discernment".
The soft and the weak can overcome the hard and the strong.
Just like the fish should not leave the deep,
The machination in politics must not be revealed to the public.
