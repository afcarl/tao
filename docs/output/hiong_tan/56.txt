He who really knows does not speak.
He who speaks does not know.
You must block the portals to your sensory organs.
You must also blunt the sharp edge and reduce the complexity.
You must attenuate the glares and mix with commoners.
This is to attain "the divine oneness".
Henceforth, you are not concerned about intimacy or estrangement.
You have no concerns about advantage and disadvantage.
You have no concerns about nobility and lowliness.
Everyone treasures you.
