People are starving because they are forced to pay onerous taxes.
That is why they are starving.
People are unruly because they are burdened by excessive rules.
This is why they become unruly.
Whilst living lavishly, the ruler extorts heavy taxes from the people, forcing them to risk their lives simply to eke out a living.
That is why the people are not afraid to die.
Hence, frugal rulers are infinitely better than those harsh ones who extort heavy taxes to live luxuriously.
