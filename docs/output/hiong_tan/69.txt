There is a saying among the militarists:
"I would rather defend than initiate an attack.
I would be most reluctant to advance an inch but quite ready to retreat a foot."
The ultimate ideal is as follows:
Not having any battalions to form a configuration,
Not having to initiate an attack,
Not needing to take up arms,
And not having to fight a war.
There is no disaster worse than to underestimate your enemy,
For this could endanger your life.
Hence, if two evenly-matched armies fight against each other,
The aggrieved side that feels poignantly oppressed will win.
