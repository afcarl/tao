Personal glory or your life,
Which do you treasure more?
Your life or worldly possessions,
Which is more precious to you?
Gaining one but losing the other, which is more deleterious?
Therefore, wanting something badly can cost you dearly.
The more goods you hoard, the more you can possibly lose.
By being contented, you will never suffer any humiliation.
Knowing when to stop, you will never put your life in jeopardy.
Hence, you will have a long and wonderful life.
