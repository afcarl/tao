(To requite injuries with good deeds.)
To allay the main discontent,
But only in a manner that will certainly produce further discontents can hardly be called successful.

Therefore the Sage behaves like the holder of the left-hand tally,
Who stays where he is and does not go round making claims on people.

For he who has the “power” of Tao is the Grand Almoner;
He who has not the “power” is the Grand Perquisitor.
“It is Heaven's way, without distinction of persons,
To keep the good perpetually supplied.”
