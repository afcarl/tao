As for the things that from of old have understood the Whole —
The sky through such understanding remains limpid,
Earth remains steady,
The spirits keep their holiness,
The abyss is replenished,
The ten thousand creatures bear their kind,
Barons and princes direct their people.
It is the Whole that causes it.
Were it not so limpid, the sky would soon get torn,
Were is not for steadiness, the earth would soon tip over,
Were it not for their holiness, the spirit would soon wither away.
Were it not for this replenishment, the abyss would soon go dry,
Were it not that ten thousand creatures can bear their kind,
They would soon become extinct.
Were the barons and princes no longer directors of their people
And for that reason honoured and exalted, they would soon be overthrown.
Truly “ the humble is the stem upon which the mighty grows,
The low is the foundation upon which the high is laid.”
That is why barons and princes refer to themselves as “The Orphan”,
“The Needy”, “The Ill-provided.
Is this not indeed a case of might rooting itself upon humility?
True indeed are the sayings:
“Enumerate the parts of a carriage,
And you still have not explained what a carriage is,”
And They did not want themselves to tinkle like jade-bells,
While others resounded like stone chimes”.
