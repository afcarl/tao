A large kingdom must be like the low ground towards which all streams flows down.
It must be a point towards which all things under heaven converge.
Its part must be that of the female in its dealings with all things under heaven.

The female by quiescence conquers the male; by quiescence gets underneath.
If a large kingdom can in the same way succeed in getting underneath a small kingdom
Then it will win the adherence of the small kingdom;
And it is because small kingdoms are by nature in this way underneath large kingdoms
That they win the adherence of large kingdoms.
The one must get underneath in order to do it;
The other is underneath and therefore does it.
(What large countries really need is more inhabitants;
And what small countries need is some place
Where their surplus inhabitants can go and get employment.)
Thus each gets what it needs.
That is why I say the large kingdom must “get underneath”.
