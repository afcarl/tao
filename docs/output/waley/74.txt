The people are not frightened of death.
What then is the use of trying to intimidate them with the death-penalty?

And even supposing people were generally frightened of death
And did not regard it as an everyday thing,
Which of us would dare to seize them and slay them?

There is the Lord of Slaughter always ready for this task,
And to do it in his stead is like thrusting oneself into the master-carpenter's place
And doing his chipping for him.
Now “he who tries to do the master-carpenter's chipping for him is lucky if he does not cut his hand.”
