Nothing under heaven is softer or more yielding than water;
But when it attacks things hard and resistant there is not one of them that can prevail.
For they can find no way of altering it.

That the yielding conquers the resistant
And the soft conquers the hard is a fact known by all men,
Yet utilized by none.

Yet it is in reference to this that the Sage said
“Only he who has accepted the dirt of the country can be lord of its soil shrines;
Only he who takes upon himself the evils of the country
Can become a king among those what dwell under heaven.”
Straight words seem crooked.
