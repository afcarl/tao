Tao in the Universe is like the south-west corner in the house.
It is the treasure of the good man,
The support of the bad.
There is a traffic in speakers of fine words;
Persons of grave demeanour are accepted as gifts;
Even the bad let slip no opportunity to acquire them.
Therefore on the day of an Emperor's enthronement
Or at the installation of the three officers of State
Rather than send a team of four horses, preceded by a disc of jade,
Better were it, as can be done without moving from one's seat,
To send this Tao.
For what did the ancients say of this Tao,
How did they prize it?
Did they not say of those that have it
“Pursuing, they shall catch; pursued, they shall escape?”
They thought it, indeed, most precious of all things under heaven.
