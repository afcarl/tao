Heaven's way is like the bending of a bow.
When a bow is bent the top comes down and the bottom-end comes up.

So too does Heaven take away from those who have too much,
And give to those that have not enough.
But if it is Heaven's way to take from those who have too much
And give to those who have not enough, this is far from being man's way.
He takes away from those that have not-enough in order
To make offering to those who already have too much.
One there is and one only, so rich that he the possessor of Tao.
(If, then, the Sage “though he controls does not lean,
And when he has achieved his aim does not linger”,
It is because he does not wish to reveal himself as better than others.)
