People with profound Te are like babies.
Poisonous insects cannot bite them.
Ferocious beasts cannot grab them.
Birds of prey cannot pounce on them.
With tough bones and flexible muscles they can hold firmly.
Without knowing male and female union, sexual organs can function, because the hormone comes into play.
They can cry a whole day without getting hoarse, because harmony comes into play.
Knowing harmony is called normalcy.
Knowing normalcy is called wisdom.
Fortifying oneself is ominous.
Things become old while still in their golden time.
This does not conform to Tao.
Departing from Tao leads to a premature end.
