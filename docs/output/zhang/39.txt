Previously those who have integrity are as follows:
Heaven has integrity, so it is clear.
Earth has integrity, so it is peaceful.
Gods have integrity, so they are responsive.
Valleys have integrity, so they are full.
All living creatures have integrity, so they can live.
Kings and lords have integrity, so they can govern normally.
Why is it so?
If Heaven is not clear, it could split.
If Earth is not peaceful, it could collapse.
If Gods are not responsive, nobody would worship.
If valleys are not full, they could be depleted.
If living creatures cannot live, they would become extinct.
If Kings and lords cannot govern normally, they would fall.
Therefore, humbleness is the root from which nobleness grows.
Low is the foundation on which high is built.
It is because of this, kings and lord call themselves lonely persons, friendless persons, and worthless persons.
This is for the sake of being humble, is it not?
The extremely honorable is the one without being honored.
They do not want to be like glittering jades, but like solid rocks.
