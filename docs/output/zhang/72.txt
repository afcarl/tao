When people defy authority, great threat will come.
Do not disturb people's homes; do not interfere with people's lives.
Only this way, we can avoid getting weary.
Sages know themselves but are not presumptuous.
They have self-esteem but are not self-conceit.
That is, take the former and abandon the latter.
