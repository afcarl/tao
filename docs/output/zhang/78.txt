Nothing in the world is more flexible and adaptable than water.
Yet, when conquering the hard and strong, nothing is better.
This is because water does not have definite shape.
The yielding wins over the strong.
Flexibility wins over rigidity.
Everybody understands this.
But few practice it.
Therefore the sage says:
"Those, who can endure disgrace for their kingdom, can be the head of the kingdom;
Those, who can accept misfortune for their kingdom, can be Emperor of the world."
These logical words appear to be controversial.
