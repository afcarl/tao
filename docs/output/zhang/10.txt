Can you keep your mind and your action consistent?
Can you be simple and sincere like a baby?
Can you view things without bias?
Can you govern without imposing your will?
Can you be moderate in daily business?
Can you keep open mind when learning?
Birth and growth are natural.
Do not think birth is someone's achievements.
Do not be vainglorious for your accomplishments.
Do not impede growth.
This is called the profound virtue.
