Credible words are not sweet; sweet words are not credible.
Honest people do not need to argue for themselves; those who argue for themselves are not honest.
Experts have deep knowledge about their specialties; those who try to learn everything would know little about each.
Sages never accumulate wealth.
They believe the more they give up, the more they have;
And the more they give away, the more they accumulate.
Tao of the Nature is this: benefiting without harming.
Tao of People is this: achieving without rivaling.
