In small countries with fewer people,
No delicate utensils are used.
Make people fear death so that they refuse to venture far away.
Although there are vehicles and boats, nobody uses them.
Although there are troops and weapons, they are not deployed.
Let people once again use knot-tying to keep records.
Let people enjoy their food, beautify their clothes, live peacefully, and be happy with their traditions.
Although neighboring kingdoms are within sight; and dog barks and roster crows can be heard over the border, but people never interfere with each other in their lifetime.
