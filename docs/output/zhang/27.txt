An able driver leaves no ruts and tracks.
An eloquent speaking is flawlessly fluent.
A smart counter uses no tools.
A superb lock cannot be opened, yet it has not bolts.
A good tie cannot get loose, yet there is no rope used.
The sage constantly saves people, so nobody is abandoned;
And constantly saves things, so nothing is wasted.
This is intelligent.
Thus, able people can be the teachers of incompetent people.
The failure of incompetent people can serve as lessons for the able people.
Ignoring the teachers and neglecting the lessons make even the smart people blunder.
This is an extremely important point.
