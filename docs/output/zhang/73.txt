When courage is combined with boldness, one dies.
When courage is combined with prudence, one survives.
Of the two, which is beneficial and which is harmful?
It is hard to know what Heaven dislikes.
This is why even sages feel the difficulty.
The Tao of the nature is that:
The best winnings come without rivaling.
The best responses are not wordy.
The best friends come without formal invitation.
The best plans are made when relaxed.
Heaven's net is wide.
Although it has meshes, nothing escapes from it.
