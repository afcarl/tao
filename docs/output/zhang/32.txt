Tao does not have a name and is simple.
It is small, but no one can rule it.
If kings and nobles can follow it, the people themselves would be submissive.
When heaven and earth work together, rain is produced.
Nobody gives the order, it is produced naturally.
When a regulation is initiated, it should have a reason.
When there is a reason, we need to know where to stop.
If we know where to stop, we may avoid failure.
Tao to the world is like the sea to the rivers.
