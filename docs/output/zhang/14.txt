Tao cannot be seen, cannot be heard, and cannot be grasped.
We cannot detect them with our senses.
Therefore, they form an entirety of Tao.
It is neither too bright above, nor is it too dark below.
It exists everywhere and yet cannot be pointed out.
So it is ultimately abstract.
It is a state without concrete constitution; it is an image without concrete shape.
So it is evasive.
When you look at it, you cannot see the beginning; when you follow it, you cannot see the end.
Using the time-tested Tao, we can handle the present problems.
Therefore, whose who understand Tao understand the laws of the universe.
