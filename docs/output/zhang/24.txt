On tiptoes, one cannot stand steadily.
Astride, one cannot walk ahead.
Those who brag about themselves cannot be held in great respect.
Those who assume they are always right cannot be outstanding.
Those who go to the extreme cannot achieve goals.
Those who are vainglorious cannot keep making progress.
This is Tao.
Those behaviors, like leftover food or an overweight person, are unattractive to everyone.
Thus Tao followers avoid them.
