Knowledgeable people rarely show off.
Boastful people are not truly knowledgeable.
Block up leakages;
Close doors;
Smooth out sharp edges;
Resolve conflicts;
Harmonize glares;
And blend into the base.
These are profound concords.
Do not become intimate when receiving the desired.
Do not become alienating when receiving the undesired.
Do not become greedy when obtaining profit.
Do not retaliate when receiving hostility.
Do not prize when obtaining the precious.
Do not debase when receiving humility.
Doing so can gain respect from others.
