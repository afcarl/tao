Don't artificially set the rules for family relations and people will return to their nature of loving each other.
Don't reward cleverness and profit, the robberies and the thefts will disappear.
The three measures stated above are not enough.
We must fill people's mind with frugality, honesty, selflessness, and abstinence.
