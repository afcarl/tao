Sages have no mind-set.
They take common people's concerns as theirs.
Good people, I treat them well.
Bad people, I also treat them well.
This is the virtue of kindness.
Good people, I trust them properly.
Bad people, I also trust them properly.
This is virtue of trust.
Sages in the world have no bias.
They mix their mind with that of common people.
This is why people follow them.
Sages treat people as if they were their own children.
