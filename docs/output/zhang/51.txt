Everything is born from Tao, and nurtured by Te; shaped by substance, and completed by environment.
Thus, everything follows Tao and is guided by Te.
Tao is honored.
Te is valued.
This is not the result of promotion, but occurs naturally.
This is why everything is born by Tao and nurtured by Te.
Te raises, educates, mentors, coaches, nourishes, and protects everything.
Giving lives without possessing them,
Guiding without forcing,
Developing without controlling,
This is called Profound Te.
