Five colors harm the eyes.
Five tones impair the ear.
Five flavors numb the taste.
Horse racing and hunting make people exuberant.
Hard-to-get things burden people.
Therefore, the sage seeks inner satisfaction, rather than showy appearance.
That is, emphasizing what is on the inside, instead of what is on the outside.
