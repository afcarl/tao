To conquer and rule the world, I think, is not achievable.
The world is like a sacred utensil, which cannot be taken and held.
Whoever tries to conquer it will fail.
Whoever tries to hold it will lose it.
Thus, the sage does not try this, so he can avoid failure.
The sage does not try to own the world, so he loses nothing.
Things can be fast or slow, warm or cool, strong or weak, light or heavy.
The sage avoids the excessive, extravagant, and grandiose.
