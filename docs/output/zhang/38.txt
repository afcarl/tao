High Te is Te because it is not showy.
Low Te is not Te because it is showy.
People with high Te do not force their way but they have their way.
People with low Te have no way except to force their way.
Top benevolence standard has its way without forcing it.
Top moral conduct has its way with efforts.
Top ritual rules have their way with rare response.
Then force is used to make people comply.
Therefore, when Tao is lost, Te is established.
When Te is lost, a benevolent standard is established.
When the benevolent standard is lost, moral conduct is established.
When moral conduct is lost, ritual rules are established.
So-called ritual rules do not advocate honesty and trustworthiness.
Thus, they are the source of disorder.
Boasting scholars are the flashy decorations of Tao; they are the origin of stupidity.
Consequently, great men stay with profoundness, avoid superficiality.
They stay with substance, avoid flashy superficies.
That is, they take former and avoid latter.
