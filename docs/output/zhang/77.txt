Tao of Nature is like tensing the string of a bow.
The high parts of the string comes down, the low parts lift up.
If it is too long, then we cut out excessive part.
If it is too short, then we add some.
It is Tao of Nature that excessive part is reduced and insufficient part is supplemented.
But Tao of People is opposite.
The poor become poorer.
The rich become richer.
Only those who have Te can donate their surplus to the world.
This is why sages work but do not force their way, and succeed but do not glorify their merits.
It is their modesty that is wise.
