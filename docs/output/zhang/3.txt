Do not glorify the elite, and people will not compete.
Do not treasure rare things, and people will not steal them.
Do not let people see things that induce desire, and people will not commit crimes.
Thus,
the sage will make people know less, but feed them well;
make them less ambitious, but physically strong;
make people less knowledgeable and have less desire.
This way, even knowledgeable people would not dare to have ambition.
Do not coerce people, and then they are not difficult to rule.
