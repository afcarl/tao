Governing a big kingdom is like cooking small seafood.
With Tao as guidance, evils will never have their way.
It is actually not that the evils do not have their way, but that the evils will not hurt people.
Not only do Evils not hurt people, but also do not hurt the sage.
When both people and the sage are not hurt, Te is in dominance.
