Preaching less conforms to the natural way.
A squall rarely lasts a whole morning.
A downpour rarely continues all the day.
Who makes the wind and rain?
It is the nature.
If the nature cannot have long-lasting stamina, how can people?
Therefore, those who follow Tao live with Tao.
Those who follow Te live with Te.
Those who follow nothing live with nothing.
Those who live with Tao are happy with Tao.
Those who live with Te are happy with Te.
Those who live with nothing abandon Tao.
There are people who are not whole-heartedly Tao-believer.
There are people who do not believe in Tao at all.
