Those who grasp Tao will be followed by the whole world.
Following without worries, the world becomes secure, peaceful, and prosperous.
Music and banquet make the travelers stop by.
But when Tao is said, it is plain and flavorless.
It is invisible when it is looked at.
It is inaudible when it is listened to.
It is inexhaustible when it is utilized.
