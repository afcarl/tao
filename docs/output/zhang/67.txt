People in the world say to me that Tao is great but it resembles nothing.
It is because of the greatness that nothing is like it.
If it were similar to anything, it would have turned trivial long ago.
I have three great treasures - Hold and maintain them.
The first is kindness.
The second is frugality.
The third is the reluctance to be prestigious in the world.
Being kind, one can have courage.
Being frugal, one can grow wide.
Reluctance to be prestigious, one can become the leader.
If one is courageous without kindness, expanding without frugality, and prestigious without modesty, he is doomed to fail.
With kindness, one would win in war, and be secure in defense.
When heaven come to rescue, it guards by using kindness.
