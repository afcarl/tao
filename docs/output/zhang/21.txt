The state of the world follows the Tao.
What is Tao?
It is intangible.
Foggily and hazily there appears to be an image.
Hazily and foggily there seems to be an object.
Distantly and elusively it emerges over there.
It is the truth.
It is believable.
From ancient time, it has been there; everything is following it.
How do I know it is so?
From everything that is observable.
