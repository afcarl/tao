The universe is long-lasting.
The reason it can last long is because it is not living for itself, therefore it can be enduring.
Following this,
the sage is modest and yet he is ahead of others;
he cares less for himself, and yet he gains respect from others;
is it not because he is not anxious for his goal, and yet his goal is achieved?
