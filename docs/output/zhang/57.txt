Govern the kingdom by the normal way.
Fight the battle by the unexpected way.
And one can win the world without using force.
How do I know this is so?
By the following:
When there are too many restrictions and regulations, people become poor.
When there are too many weapons, the kingdom is in disarray.
When there are too many tricks, bizarre things happen.
When there are too many decrees, the crime rate increases.
This is why the sage says:
"I do not force my way, and people live peacefully.
I keep quiet, and people live normally.
I do not interfere, and people become rich.
I do not covet anything, and people would be honest."
