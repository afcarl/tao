There had been a chaotic object before the universe was born.
It is quiet and intangible.
It stays alone without changing.
It moves around without stopping.
It may be the mother of the universe.
I do not know the object's name.
I have attempted to designate it Tao, and to call it great.
The great constantly moves.
Constantly moving it reaches far.
Far-reaching causes it to return.
Therefore, Tao is great, the heaven is great, the earth is great, and the human is also great.
There are four greats in the universe, and the human is one of them.
The human follows the earth, the earth follows the heaven, the heaven follows Tao, and Tao goes naturally.
