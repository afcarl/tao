My words are easy to understand and easy to practice.
However, people in the world rarely understand and practice them.
The words have their origins.
The events have their causes.
People can hardly understand this.
Therefore they rarely understand me.
Few people understand me.
Those who do follow me are prized.
This is why sages dress in crude clothes but carry jades.
