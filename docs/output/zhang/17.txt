The best government is one in which its citizens are unaware of its existence.
The next best rewards the citizens so that they are loyal.
A worse one, make the citizens fear.
The worst causes them to rebel.
Because such rulers lose credibility therefore people no longer trust them.
Take it easy and never abuse the power.
This will make rulers more successful and satisfied.
In turn, the citizen would praise such rulers who make them at ease.
