Heaven and earth have no bias; they treat everything as if they are the straw dogs used in ritual;
Rulers have no biases; they treat citizens as if they are the straw dogs.
The world is like the bellows.
When it is static, its ability to blow is not lost.
When it is moving, it generates more and more wind.
To go extreme is not as good as to stay normal.
