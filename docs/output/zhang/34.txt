Tao is everywhere.
It can be guidance.
Everything lives depending on it without exception, With such accomplishment, it claims none.
Providing clothing and food to everything, it does not govern them: this is called lowliness.
Guiding everything, it does not master, this can be called greatness.
Because it does not proclaim to be great, it can actually be great.
