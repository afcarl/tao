The best virtue is like water.
Water nurtures everything; yet, without rivaling, it flows towards lower grounds, where people would be reluctant to go.
Water behaves like following Tao.
Live in suitable place;
Think deeply;
Give generously;
Keep one's words;
Rule orderly;
Do things ably;
Act when the time is right.
Do not rival, then there would be no trouble.
