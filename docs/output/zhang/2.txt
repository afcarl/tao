People know what beauty is, because there is ugliness;
people know what good is, because there is bad.
Likewise, empty and full, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sound and tone, front and rear, all go side by side.
Thus,
the sage handles affairs without the intention for fame, and teaches without preaching,
lets things develop without initialize them,
lets things grow without interfering them,
lets things move ahead without forcing them,
lets things succeed without boast about them.
Because the sage does not brag his success, he would continue to be successful.
