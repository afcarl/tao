Malleability preserves entirety.
Mistakes teach lessons.
Empty containers can be filled.
Breakages cause replacement.
Less makes success.
Much leads to confusion.
Thus the sage believes Tao is the only law of the universe.
He does not brag himself so he can be held in great respect.
He does not assume he is always right so he can be unbiased.
He does not exaggerate so he can be right.
He is not vainglorious so he can keep making progress.
If you do not compete, then no one can compete with you in the world.
So how can the old saying, such as 'Malleability preserves entirety', be not without truth?
They all return to Tao.
