When alive, people are pliable and soft; at death, people become rigid and hard.
When alive, grasses and trees are flexible and tender; at death, they become withered and rotten.
Therefore, rigidity leads to death, flexibility results in survival.
It is because of this, the inflexible army would be defeated, like stiff trees would be broken by wind.
The big and rigid would be overtaken by the nimble and flexible.
