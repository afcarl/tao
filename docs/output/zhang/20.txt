Studying thoroughly makes people free of worries.
What is the difference between yes and no?
What is the difference between good and evil?
Don't fear when the crowd is afraid.
Why do people feel perplexed?
Because the universe is infinite!
People are cheerful, as if at banquets, and as if sight seeing from a tower in spring.
I show no emotion, like an infant, and as if wandering aimlessly.
People have plenty, but I am alone as if I have lost everything.
I look foolish and stupid.
Ordinary crowds look smart, while I appear naive.
Ordinary crowds look sharp, while I appear dull.
People look deft, while I appear awkward.
I am different from the crowd.
This is because I follow Tao.
