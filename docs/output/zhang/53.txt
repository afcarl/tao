I firmly believe that I must follow Tao.
What I fear is to wander astray.
Tao is like a boulevard.
Yet, some people prefer small trails.
The yards are excessively clean, the fields full of weeds, and the warehouses nearly empty.
Dressing extravagantly, carrying sharp swords, wasting food, excessively collecting money or properties are the worst sins.
These do not conform to Tao.
