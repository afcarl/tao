When hearing Tao, the intelligent people practice it diligently.
The average people practice it casually.
Ignorant people laugh at it.
If it were not laughed at, it would not be Tao.
It is said that true Tao-followers appear to be ignorant.
Although they are making progress, they appear to be receding.
The perfect Tao appears to be blemished.
High Te is like the valleys.
Bright white appears to be tarnished.
Broad kindness appears to be insufficient.
Diligent people could look lazy.
Authentic qualities could look faked.
A great square appears to have no corner.
Great success does not achieve early.
Great music does not sound loud.
Great image does not have form.
Tao is invisible and nameless.
It is only Tao that can lend help and make endeavors successful.
