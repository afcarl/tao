Tao is the law of the universe.
For able people Tao is a treasure.
For less able people, Tao is a guardian.
Good words can win reverence.
Good behavior can win admiration.
For people who are inept, should they be abandoned?
Therefore for the emperor who is enthroned and the three senior administrators who are appointed, there may be priceless jades and fast carriages, none is as good as adopting Tao.
Why Tao is so treasured by generations?
Is it not because it helps us reach our goals and avoid mistakes?
Therefore it is treasured by the whole world.
