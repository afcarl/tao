Tao normally does not interfere, yet it plays a role everywhere.
If the kings and nobles can follow it, everything would become submissive.
If rebellion is attempted, I will use Tao's extreme honesty to suppress it.
Using Tao's extreme honesty to suppress it, people would have no ambition.
With no ambition, people would be peaceful.
Thus, the world would go back to normal.
