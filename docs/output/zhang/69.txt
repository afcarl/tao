It is a military saying that when engaging in war, we do not aggress but defend; we do not advance an inch but retreat a foot.
This is marching without formation.
Do not roll up sleeves.
Confront no enemy.
Commit to no weapons.
The most serious mistake is to underestimate the enemy.
Underestimating the enemy almost caused me to lose my treasures.
Thus, when two comparable armies fight, the lamenting one wins.
