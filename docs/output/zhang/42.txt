Tao produce unity.
Unity splits into two.
Two gives birth to three.
Three produces everything.
Everything carries Yin and embraces Yang.
Yin and Yang work together makes harmony.
Loneliness, friendlessness, and worthlessness are generally disliked.

Things can benefit from damages.
Things can also be damaged from benefits.
Therefore, I can teach what the other taught me:
Those who act against the law of the Nature will never get what they want.
This is a basic principle for me to teach.
