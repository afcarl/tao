Great achievement appears imperfect, Its application is limitless.
Complete fullness appears empty, It cannot be used up.
Perfect straightness appears bent.
Adept skills appear awkward.
Great eloquence appears dull.
The calm wins out over the impatient.
The cold wins out over the heat.
Serenity makes the world orderly.
