Frugality is the best for governing people or serving heaven.
With frugality, we can be prepared in advance.
Advanced preparation is to emphasize accumulating Te.
Accumulating Te, we can accomplish any endeavor.
Accomplishing any endeavor means there is not limit.
With no limit we can have a kingdom.
With frugality as the mother of the kingdom, the kingdom can last long.
This is called deep root and firm foundation.
With such root and foundation we can enjoy longevity.
