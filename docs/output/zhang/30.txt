Those who aid the ruler with Tao do not use military power to win the world.
This is because such action is likely to backfire:
Where armies camp, thorny problems arise,
Where troops march, fatal years follow.
The competent general stops when the goal is reached, and never flaunts.
Never be vainglorious when the goal is achieved.
Never be haughty when the goal is achieved.
Never be arrogant when the goal is achieved.
Never do more than necessary when the goal is achieved.
Never flaunt when the goal is achieved.
It is not following Tao if things wilt while still in their prime.
Not following Tao results in an untimely end.
