In history, those who mastered Tao are extremely knowledgeable with profound expertise.
Hence they are hard to describe.
Because of this, I can only roughly portray them as follows:
Being prudent as if walking across the thin ice of the river,
Being alert as if being surrounded with the danger,
Being dignified like a guest,
Being relaxed as if thawing,
Being sincere and natural like uncarved wood,
Being open-hearted like valley,
Being approachable like the earth,
Being broad like ocean,
Being active like wind blowing.
Can the murkiness be clarified slowly?
Can a halt start to move gradually?
Those who know Tao would never be complacent.
It is because of this they can be refreshing, creative, and innovative.
