In the life and death cycle,
Three in ten enjoy natural longevity,
Three in ten die normally.
There are some, three in ten, who die unnaturally.
Why it is so?
Because they indulge themselves excessively.
It is well known that those who are good at protect themselves steer clear of rhinos and tigers when walking, And hardly hurt by armed enemy.
This is because rhinos cannot find them to gore,
Tigers cannot find them to claw,
Enemies cannot get a chance to use weapons upon them.
What is the reason?
They never put themselves into a fatal situation.
