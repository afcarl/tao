My sayings are easy to recognize, and very easy to apply. But no one in the world can recognize them, and no one can apply them.
Sayings have a source, events have a leader. It is only through ignorance that I am not known. Those who know me are rare; those who emulate me a noble.
This is why sages dress plainly, and conceal what is precious.
