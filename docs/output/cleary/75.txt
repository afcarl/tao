When people are starving, it is because their governments take too much, causing hem to starve.
When people are hard to control, it is because of the contrivances of their governments, which make them hard to control.
When people slight death, it is because of the earnestness with which they seek life; that makes them slight death. Only those who do not contrive to live are wise in valuing life.
