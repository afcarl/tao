Heaven and earth are not humane; they regard all beings as straw dogs.
Sages are not humane; they see all people as straw dogs..
The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows and pipes, empty yet inexhaustible, producing more with each movement.
The talkative reach their wits' end again and again; that is not as good as keeping centered.
