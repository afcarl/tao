Know the male, keep to the female; be humble toward the world. Be humble toward the world, and eternal power never leaves, returning again to innocence.
Knowing the white, keep the black; be an exemplar for the world. Be an exemplar for the world, and eternal power never goes awry, returning again to infinity.
Knowing thee glorious, keep the ignominious; be open to the world. Be open to the world, and eternal power suffices, returning again to simplicity.
Simplicity is lost to make instruments, which sages employ as functionaries. Therefore the great fashioner does no splitting.
