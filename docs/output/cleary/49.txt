Sages have no fixed mind; they make the minds of the people their mind:
they improve the good, and also improve those who are not good; that virtue is good.
They make sure of the true, and they make sure of the untrue too; that virtue is sure.
The relation of sages to the world is one of concern: they cloud their minds for the world; all people pour into their ears and eye, and sages render them innocent.
