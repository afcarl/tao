When holding the Great Image, the world goes on and on without harm, peaceful, even, tranquil.
When there is music and dining, passing travelers stop;
but the issue of the Way is so plain as to be flavorless. When you look at it, it is invisible; when you listen to it, it is inaudible; when you use it, it cannot be exhausted.
