Not exalting cleverness causes the people not to contend.
Not putting high prices on hard-to-get goods causes the people not to steal.
Not seeing anything to want causes the mind not to be confused.
Therefore the government of sages empties the mind and fills the middle, weakens the ambition and strengthens the bones,
always keeping the people innocent and passionless. It makes the sophisticated not dare to contrive;
action being without contrivance, nothing is disordered.
