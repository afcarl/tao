By nondoing, strive for nonstriving, savor the flavorless,
regard the small as important, make much of little, repay enmity with virtue;
plan for difficulty when it is still easy, do the great while it is still small.
The most difficult things in the world must be done while they are easy; the greatest things in the world must be done whenthey are small.
Because of this sages never do greeat things; that is why they can fulfill their greatness.
If you agree too easily, you'll be little trusted; if you take it easy a lot, you'll have a lot of problems.
Therefore it is through difficulty that sages end up without problems.
