When everyone knows beauty is beauty, this is bad.
When everyone knows good is good, this is not good.
So being and nonbeing produce each other: difficulty and ease complement each other, long and short shape each other,
high and low contrast with each other, voice and echoes conform to each other, before and after go along with each other.
So sages manage effortless service and carry out unspoken guidance.
All beings work, without exception: if they live without possessiveness,
act without presumption, and do not dwell on success, then by this very nondwelling success will not leave.
