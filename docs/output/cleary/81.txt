True words are not beautiful, beautiful words are not true.
The good are not argumentative, the argumentative are not good.
Knowers do not generalize, generalists do not know.
Sages do not accumulate anything but give everything to others, having more the more they give.
The Way of heaven helps and does not harm. The Way for humans is to act without contention.
