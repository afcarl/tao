The Way produces one; one produces two, two produce three, three produce all beings:
all beings bear yin and embrace yang, with a mellowing energy for harmony.

Therefore people may gain from loss, and may lose from gain.
What others teach, I also teach. The strong cannot master their death: I take this to be the father of teachings.
