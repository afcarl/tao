The richness of subliminal virtue is comparable to an infant: poisonous creatures do not sting it, wild beasts do not claw it, predatory birds do not grab it. Its tendons are flexible, yet its grip is firm.
Even while it knows not of the mating of male and female, its genitals get aroused; this is the epitome of vitality.
It can cry all day without choking or getting hoarse; this is the epitome of harmony. Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity;
enhancing life is called propitious, the mind mastering energy is called strong.
When beings climax in power, they wane; this is called being unguided. The unguided die early.
