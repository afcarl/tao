Be tactful and you remain whole; bend and you remain straight. The hollow is filled, the old is renewed. Economy is gain, excess is confusion..
Therefore sages embrace unity as model for the world.
Not seeing themselves, they are therefore clear. Not asserting themselves, they are therefore outstanding. Not congratulating themselves, they are therefore meritorious. Not taking pride in themselves, they last long.
It is just because they do not contend that no one in the world can contend with them.
Is it empty talk, the old saying that tact keeps you whole? When truthfulness is complete, it still resorts to this.
