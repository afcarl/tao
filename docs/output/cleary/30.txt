Those who assist human leaders with the Way do not coerce the world with weapons, for these things are apt to backfire.
Brambles grow where an army has been; there are always bad years after a war.
Therefore the good are effective, that is all; they do not presume to grab power thereby:
they are effective but not conceited, effective but not proud, effective but not arrogant. They are effective when they have to be, effective but not coercive.
If you peak in strength, you then age; this, it is said, is unguided. The unguided soon come to an end.
