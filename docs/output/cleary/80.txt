A small state has few people. It has the people keep arms but not use them. It has them regard death gravely and not go on distant campaigns.
Even if they have vehicles, they have nowhere to drive them. Even if they have weapons, they have nowhere to use them.
It has the people go back to simple techniques, relish their food, like their clothes, be comfortable in their ways, and enjoy their work.
Neighboring states may be so close they can hear each other's dogs and roosters, but they make it o that the people have never gone back and forth.
