The Way is the pivot of all things: the treasure of good people, the safeguard of those who are not good.
Fine words can be sold, honored acts can oppress people; why should people who are not good abandon them.
Therefore to establish an emperor and set up high officials, one may have a great jewel and drive a team of horses, but that is not as good as advancing callmly on this Way.
Why did the ancients value this Way? By it one can attain without long seeking and escape from the faults oe has; therefore it is valued by the world.
