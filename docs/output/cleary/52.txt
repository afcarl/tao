The world has a beginning that is the mother of the world.
Once you have found the mother, thereby you know the child. Once you know the child, you return to keep the mother, not perishing though the body may die.
Close your eyes, shut your doors, and you do not toil all your life.
Open your eyes, carry out your affair, and you re not saved all your life.
Seeing the small is called clarity; keeping flexible is called strength.
Using the shining radiance, you return again to the light, not leaving anything to harm yourself. This is called entering the eternal.
