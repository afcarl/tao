There are sayings on the use of arms: "Let us not be aggressors, but defend." "Let us not advance an inch, but retreat a foot."
This is called carrying out no action, shaking no arm, facing no enemy, wielding no weapon.
No calamity is greater than underestimating opponents. If you underestimate opponents, you're close to losing your treasure.
So when opposing armies clash, the compassionate are the ones who win.
