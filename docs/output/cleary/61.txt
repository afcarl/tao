A great nation flows downward into intercourse with the world. The female of the world always prevails over the male by stillness.
Because stillness is considered lower, by lowering itself to a small nation a great nation takes a small nation; by being lower than a great nation a small nation takesa gret nation.
So one takes by lowering itself, another takes place by being lower.
A great nation wants no more than to include and nurture people; a small nation ants no more than to admit and serve people.
Both get what they want, so the great should be below.
