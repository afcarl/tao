Higher good is like water: the good in water benefits all, and does so without contention. It rests where people dislike to be, so it is close to the Way.
Where it dwells becomes good ground; profound is the good in its heart, benevolent the good it bestows. Goodness in words is trustworthiness,
goodness in government is order; goodness in work is ability, goodness in action is timeliness.
But only by non-contention is there nothing extreme.
