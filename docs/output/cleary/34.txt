The Great Way is universal; it can apply to the left or the right.
All beings depend on it for life, and it does not refuse. Its accomplishments fulfilled, it does not dwell on them. It lovingly nurtures all beings, but does not act as their ruler.
As it has no desire, it can be called small.
All beings take to it, yet it does not act as their ruler, it can be called great.
Therefore sages never contrive greatness; that is why they can become so great.
