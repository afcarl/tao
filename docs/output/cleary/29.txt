Should you want to take the world, and contrive to do so, I see you won't manage to finish.
The most sublime instrument in the world cannot be contrived. Those who contrive spoil it; those who cling lose it.
So creatures sometimes go and sometimes follow, sometimes puff and sometimes blow, are sometimes strong and sometimes weak, begin sometime and end sometime;
Therefore sages remove extremes, remove extravagance, remove arrogance.
