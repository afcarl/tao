Use straightforwardness for civil government, use surprise for military operations; use noninvolvement to take the world. How do I know this?
The more taboos there are in the world, the poorer the populace is;
The more crafts the people have, the more exotic things are produced; the more laws are promulgated, the greater the number of thieves.
Therefore the sage says, I contrive nothing, and the people are naturally civilized; I am fond of tranquility, and the people are naturally upright.
I have nothing to do, and the people are naturally enriched.; I have no desire, and the people are naturally simple.
