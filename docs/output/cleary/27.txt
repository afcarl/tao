Good works are trackless, good words are flawless, good planning isn't calculating.
What is well closed has no bolt locking it, but cannot be opened. What is well bound has no rope confining it, but cannot be untied.
Therefore sages always consider it good to save people, so that there are no wasted humans; they always consider it good to save beings, so that there are no wasted beings.
So good people are teachers of people who are not good. People who are not good are students of people who are good.
Those who do not honor teachers or care for students are greatly deluded, even in knowledgeable. This is called an essential subtlety.
