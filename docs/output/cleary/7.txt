Heaven is eternal, earth is everlasting.
The reason they can be eternal and everlasting is that they do not foster themselves, that is why they can live forever.
For this reason sages put themselves last, and they were first;
they excluded themselves, and they survived.
Was it not by their very selflessness that they managed to fulfill themselves?
