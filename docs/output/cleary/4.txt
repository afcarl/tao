The Way is unimpeded harmony; its potential may never be fully exploited.
It is as deep as the source of all things;
it blunts the edges, resolves the complications, harmonizes the light, assimilates to the world.
Profoundly still, it seems to be there:
I don't know whose child it is, before the creation of images.
