Something undifferentiated was born before heaven and earth; still and silent, standing alone and unchanging, going through cycles unending, able to be mother to the world.
I do not know its name; I label it the Way. Imposing on it a name, I call it Great.
Greatness means it goes; going means reaching afar; reaching afar means return.
Therefore the Way is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and kingship is also great. Among domains are four greats, of which kingship is one.
Humanity emulates earth, earth emulates heaven, heaven emulates the Way, the Way emulates nature.
