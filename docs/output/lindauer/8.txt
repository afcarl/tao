Better value looks like water

The value if water profits the 10000 things yet without contending
It dwells in places the collective mind dislikes-
So it is severed, relating to tao.

The value of a home is in location
The value of a mind is in breadth
The value of a relationship is in humanity
The value of a word is in belief
The value of a government is in governing
The value of an effort is in ability
The value of a movement is in time.

In the end only be without contending
So be absent from reproach.
