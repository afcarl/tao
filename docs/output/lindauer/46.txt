When the world is present with tao
It happens that even galloping horses fertilize
When the world is absent of tao
War-horses exist in the suburbs.

No calamity is greater than relating to not knowing enough
No fault is greater than relating to the desire to obtain.
So know the enough of being enough
There is entirely enough to go with each.
