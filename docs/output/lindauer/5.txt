Heavens and earth are without humanizing
It happens that the 10000 things act as straw dogs
Sages are without humanizing
It happens that one hundred families act as straw dogs.

The space bounding heavens and earth is just like the equal of a bellows
Empty yet not subdued
Stirring yet more goes out.

Much talk counts for little
It can't compare to obeying the center.
