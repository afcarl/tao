An aperture is the appearance of the ideal
Only tao is appropriately followed.

The action of tao on things,
Only elusive, only ungraspable.
So ungraspable, so elusive
At its center, the presence of form
So elusive, so ungraspable
At its center, the presence of things
So secluded, so hard to see
At its center, the presence of belief.

From ancient times reaching into the present its name does not depart
Experience of the collective beginning happens.

Why do I happen to know the shape of the collective beginning is this way?
It just happens.
