Those ancients who valued action in the tao
Were insightful, versatile, far-reaching, coherent.

Penetrating, one cannot understand
In the end it is only that one cannot understand
So there is more than appears to their actions.

So resigned, like fording a river in winter
Just so, like respecting all four neighbors
So reserved, like making an appearance
So melting, like ice halfway released
So genuine, like their true nature
So spacious, like a valley
So well mixed, like muddy water.

Who is able to gently calm muddy water, clearing it?
Who is able to endure gently stirring tranquillity so it gives birth?

Those who maintain this tao have no desire for fullness

In the end only lack fullness
So be able to be shabby yet perfect the new.
