Name or body, which is more prized?
Body or wealth, which is more abundant?
Obtaining or losing, which is the greater fault?
So appropriately
Being very fond seeds great cost
What is abundantly stashed seeds heavy loss.

Know enough, lack disgrace
Know to stop, lack danger
Growth and the long-lasting can happen.
