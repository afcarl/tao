Great perfection looks incomplete
Used it lacks impairment
Great fullness looks like it needs more
Used it lacks exhaustion.

Great straightness looks bent
Great skill looks awkward
Great eloquence looks like it stutters.

Restlessness conquers the cold
Stillness conquers the heated
Clarity and stillness act on the world, ordering it.
