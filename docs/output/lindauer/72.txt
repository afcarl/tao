People lack respect for impressive strength
And then greatly impressive strength is reached.

An absence of improper familiarity for what is their place of residence
An absence of detesting what is their place of living
In the end only without detesting
Appropriate lack of detesting happens.

Appropriately it happens that sages
Know themselves without displaying themselves
Are fond of themselves without treasuring themselves.

So detach from that, grab this.
