Taking emptiness to the limit
Observing stillness genuinely
Regarding the 10000 things as side-by-side
It happens that I view the return.

In the end things grow and flourish
Each returns, merging with its root.

Merging with the root, say still
Appropriately it is called returning to giving birth.

Returning to giving birth, say entireness
Knowing entireness say illuminated
Without knowing entireness presumptuously do the faminous.

Knowing entireness is tolerance
Tolerance leads to impartiality
Impartiality leads to kingliness
Kingliness leads to the heavens
The heavens lead to tao
Tao leads to what is long-lasting.

Be without a body, lack danger.
