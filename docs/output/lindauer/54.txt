That which is valuably established is not weeded out
That which is valuably embraced is not shed off.

It happens, children and grandchildren
Sacrifice to ancestors without reflection.

Tending to relating to the body
Its ideal will be real
Tending to relating to the family
Its ideal will be bubbling over
Tending to relating to the community
Its ideal will be growing
Tending to relating to the nation
Its ideal will be abundant
Tending to relating to the world
Its ideal will be everywhere.

So body happens seeing body
Family happens seeing family
Community happens seeing community
Nation happens seeing nation
World happens seeing world.

Why does it happen that I know the nature of the world?
This just happens.
