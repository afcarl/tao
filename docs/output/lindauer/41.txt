Better knights hear of tao
Dutifully, yet they are practicing it
Average knights hear of tao
They look aware, they look unaware
Lesser knights hear of tao
They have great laughing.

Without laughing, there's not enough of the action of tao happening.

So long-established words are present.
Luminous tao looks dark
Advancing tao looks like it is falling back
Level tao looks uneven
Better ideal looks like a valley
Great whiteness looks spotted
Extensive ideal looks like it lacks enough
Established ideal looks unsteady
Durable ideal looks changeable
Great squares are absent of corners
Great tools are slowly perfected
Great music sounds faint
Great form lacks shape.

Tao is hidden, absent from name
In the end,
Only tao values lending at interest and moreover perfects.
