In the world nothing is supple and weak in relation to water
Yet of those things which attack the firm and unyielding
Nothing is able to do better
In what is absent, this easily happens.

Being supple conquers the unyielding
Being weak conquers the firm
In the world
Noone is without knowing it
Noone is able to practice it.

Appropriately it happens that sages say
He who accepts the disgrace of a nation
Is appropriately called lord of the grain shrine
He who accepts the misfortune of a nation
Is appropriately acting as the king of the world.

Correct words look like they turn back.
