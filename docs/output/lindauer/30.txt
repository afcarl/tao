When it happens that tao assists men and lords
The force of the soldier is not in the world.

What takes effort is likely to return.

Briars and thorns grow within the dwelling place of the army
Behind a great military comes the seed for a faminous year.

Those who value
Achieve results yet stop
Are without venturing to strive to hold
Achieve results yet do not brag
Achieve results yet do not boast
Achieve results yet do not be arrogant
Achieve results yet without being done
Achieve results yet do not strive.

Things reach the prime and then are old?
Appropriately called not in accordance with tao

What is not in accordance with tao comes to an early end.
