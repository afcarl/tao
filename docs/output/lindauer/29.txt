It is attained, the desire to grab the world yet be acting on it
I see it has not been satisfied yet
The world, a spirited tool, cannot act either.

Those who act are spoiling
Those who take hold of are losing.

So of things
Some lead and some follow
Some gust and some puff lightly
Some are strong and some thin
Some support and some destroy.

Appropriately it happens that sages are
Apart from extremes
Apart from extravagance
Apart from excess.
