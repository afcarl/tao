Thirty spokes converge at one hub
The use of a chariot is in the presence of what is absent
Shaping clay, it happens to act as a vessel
The use of a vessel is in the presence of what is absent
Cutting doors and windows to have it act as a room
The use of a room is in the presence of what is absent.

So
Where there is presence beneficial actions happen
Where there is absence useful actions happen.
