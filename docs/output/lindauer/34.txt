Great tao flowing everywhere
It can be left or right
All things depend on it yet exist yet without being denied.

Outstanding service is performed without the presence of names
It clothes and cultivates the 10000 things
Yet without acting as lord.

With entireness absent of desire
One can name in relation to smallness
The 10000 things merge and blend
Yet without action as lord one can name great actions.

What is entirely without a self to act great happens
So it is able to perfect what is great.
