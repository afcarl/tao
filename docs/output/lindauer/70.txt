My words
Are very easy to know
Are very easy to practice.
In the world
Noone is able to know
Noone is able to practice.

Words possess an ancestor
Efforts possess a sovereign.

In the end only with absence of knowledge
Appropriate lack of self-knowledge happens
Knowledge of that which is the self is rare
And then that which is the self is treasured.

Appropriately it happens that sages have
A covering of coarse cloth
A bosom of jade.
