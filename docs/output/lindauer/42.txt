Tao gives birth to one
One gives birth to two
Two gives birth to three
Three gives birth to the 10000 things.

All things carry yin and embrace yang
With their blended animus, action in harmony happens.
In the time of men they dislike orphaned, widowed, unfavored
Yet kings and lords regard such as praiseworthy.

Men have told others
I also am telling
Those who are striving and fierce die incomplete.
I use this as the father of my teaching.
