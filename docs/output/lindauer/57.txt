When governing the nation happens correctly
Surprising use of strategy happens.
Absent of effort grabbing the world happens.

Why do I know this is so?
This just happens.

The world has an abundance of prohibitions and taboos
Yet people become increasingly inadequate
People have an abundance of beneficial tools
Confusion multiplies in the families of the nation
Men have an abundance of skills and cleverness
Surprising things arise and multiply
Laws and decrees multiply conspicuously
Robbers and thieves are present in abundance.

So sages say
I am absent of action yet people transform themselves
I am fond of stillness yet people correct themselves
I am absent of effort yet people are of themselves wealthy
I am absent from desire yet people of themselves exhibit true nature.
