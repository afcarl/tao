Those who know are without words
Those with words are without knowing.

Corking its bottle
Obstructing its door
Blunting its sharpness
Untying its tangles
Harmonizing its brightness
Being together with the dusty earth
Appropriately called insightful togetherness.

So one cannot obtain it yet be attached
One cannot obtain it yet be detached
One cannot obtain it yet benefit
One cannot obtain it yet be harmed
One cannot obtain it yet treasure
One cannot obtain it yet consider as common.

So it acts as the treasure of the world.
