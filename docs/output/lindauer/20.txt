Break off from studying, there is an absence of grief.

Being individual or pandering to each other
How do these differ?
Valuing or hating each other
What is the difference?

It looks like one cannot lack respect for what others put respect in
Such reckless desertion!
It is not yet centered, this way.

Collective mind is bright and sunny, gay and prosperous
Like enjoying a sacrificial ox
Like ascending a tower in springtime.
The self alone, so moored!
is not yet divined on the tortoise-shell
Like being a baby-child before it smiles.
Unattached, so unattached
The self looks absent of a place to merge.

In the collective mind each is present of a surplus
Yet the self alone appears to offer as a gift.
The self is foolish, men's minds are also this way
Unclear, so unclear.

Customs of men are clear, obvious
The self alone is dark, indistinct
Customs of men are curious, scrutinizing
The self alone is tightly closed, shut off.

So indifferent, it looks like the ocean
Such a gusty wind, it looks ceaseless.

In the collective mind each possesses a cause
Yet the self alone seems stubborn and rustic
The self alone differs from relating to men
Yet treasures nourishment in relating to the mother.
