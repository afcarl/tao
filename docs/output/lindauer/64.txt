What is peaceful is easily maintained
What is not begun is easily planned
What is fragile is easily shattered
What is tiny is easily scattered.

Acting relates to the not yet present
Governing relates to the not yet confused.

A tree as big as the embrace of a man is born relating to very tiny shoots
A nine story tower is raised relating to a pile of earth
A journey of a thousand li begins in relating to where you stand.

Those who act are spoiling
Those who take hold of are losing

Appropriately it happens that sages are absent of action
So there is an absence of spoiling
Are absent of taking hold of
So there is an absence of losing.

The following of people of effort in the entire
Relates to perfecting part yet spoiling
Following care throughout as if just beginning
Comes an absence of spoiling effort.

Appropriately it happens that sages
Desire without desiring
Are without treasuring goods difficult to obtain
Learn without learning
Return to the place where the collective mind passes
And come to support the self-nature of the 10000 things
Yet without venturing to act.
