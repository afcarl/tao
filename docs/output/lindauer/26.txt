Heaviness acts as root of lightness
Stillness acts as sovereign of agitation.

Appropriately it happens
That sages travel throughout the day
Without departing from heavy or light
Even though fabulous views are present
They dwell in great comfort and go about like this.
How would one be lord of 10000 war-chariots
Yet have a body which is light in the world?

Following lightness comes loss of the root
Following agitation comes loss of the sovereign.
