Heavens, growth, earth, longevity.
In heavens and earth's place
That which is able to grow and further be long-lasting happens
And something lacking existence of a self happens
So it is able to grow and give birth.

Appropriately it happens that sages
Put their bodies behind yet their bodies are ahead
Put their bodies outside yet their bodies are kept in.

Does it not happen they are absent of anomalous self-interest?
So they are able to perfect self-interest.
