That which is tao is treasurehouse for the 10000 things
Treasure of the valuing man
Place of refuge for the man who is not valuing.

Embellished words can cause respect to be marketed
Doing valued things can cause lavish praise to enter
Men who are not valuing, why be rejecting their presence?

So establish the emperor
Install three ministers
Even though it happens
That the gift of the large jade disk is preceded by a team of horses
It can not compare to sitting, emulating this tao.

Why did it happen that in ancient times
There were those who treasured this tao?
Did they go without saying
Seek and finding happens
Possess faults and escape from the anomalous happens?

So it acts as the treasure of the world
