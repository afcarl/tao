Tao, entirely absent of acting
Yet is absent of being without acting.

If nobles and kings are able to keep to it
The 10000 things attain self-transformation
Transforming yet desiring to do.

When I am able to calm the restless
An absence of naming true nature happens.

With an absence of naming true nature
In the end an absence of desire is also obtained
Without desire tranquillity happens
The world attains self-settlement.
