Bravery in relation to venturing, next comes being killed
Bravery in relation to lack of venturing, next comes being mobile
Each of these two benefits some, harms some.
The place of the heaves dislikes
Who knows why it is so?

Appropriately it happens that sages see it just as difficult.

The tao of the heavens
Without contending yet values conquering
Without words yet values responding
Without summoning yet attracts to itself
Is easy-natured yet values a place for everything.

The net of the heavens is vast, expansive
A coarse mesh yet without loss.
