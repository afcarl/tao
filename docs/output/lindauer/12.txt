Five colors blind the eye of man
Five tones deafen the ear of man
Five flavors chafe the mouth of man
Racing and hunting inspire the mind of man to express craziness
Goods difficult to obtain hamper the path of man.

Appropriately it happens
That sages act from the center without acting from the eyes.

So detach from that, grab this.
