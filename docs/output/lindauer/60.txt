Governing a great nation looks like cooking tiny fish.

When it happens that tao is present in the world
What is clever lacks spirit
What is not clever lacks spirit
What has spirit is not wounding man
What has no spirit is not wounding man.

Sages also are not wounding man.

In the end both are without wounding each other
So ideal is reached, merges, comes within.
