In the world each knows how beauty acts
Where there is beauty ugliness begins
Each knows how to value
Where there is value lack of value begins.

In this manner
Presence and absence give birth to each other
Difficult and easy complete each other
Long and short contrast each other
High and low attract each other
Tone and voice harmonize each other
Front and back follow each other.

Appropriately it happens that sages
Dwell absent of acting with effort
Do things without explaining in words
Make the 10000 things blend yet without trying to describe them
Give birth yet without possessing
Act yet without relying on results
Are of outstanding service yet aren't willing to reside therein.

In the end, only be unwilling to reside therein
Appropriately, a lack of detachment happens.
