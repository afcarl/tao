A presence of a thing mixed completely
Before the birth of heavens and earth
So lonely, so deserted
Standing alone yet without deviating
Working everywhere yet lacking danger
Action of the mother of the world can happen.

I have no knowledge of its name
Giving a word, I say tao.
Stubbornly trying to name it I say great
Great, I say passing by
Passing by, I say far-reaching
Far-reaching, I say returning.

So tao is great, heavens are great, earth is great
Kings are also great.
In the center of the universe are four greatnesses
Yet kings stand still, blending them into one.

Man is an offshoot of earth
Earth is an offshoot of the heavens
The heavens are an offshoot of tao
Tao is an offshoot of the natural.
