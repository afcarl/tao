Valuing going is absent of trace
Valuing words are absent of flaw or censure
With valuing reckoning, counters or policies are not used.

What is valuably shut
Is absent of a barrier yet cannot be opened
What is valuably tied
Is absent of restraint or restriction yet cannot be untied.

Appropriately it happens that sages
Entirely valuing help others, so others are not thrown away
Entirely valuing help things, so things are not thrown away.
Appropriately called following the luminance.

So those who value others teach those who lack valuing others
Those who lack valuing others are a resource of those who value others.
Without treasuring a teacher, or without loving a resource
Even the wise have great misconception.

Appropriately called an important subtlety.
