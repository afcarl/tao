Flexibility, then comes wholeness
Being twisted, then comes straightness
Emptiness, then comes fullness
Shabbiness, then comes newness
Scarcity, then comes obtainment
Abundance, then comes perplexity.

Appropriately it happens that sages
Embrace oneness
Act as the model of the world
Are not showing themselves so they are luminous
Are not justifying themselves so they are conspicuous
Are not boasting of themselves so outstanding service is performed
Are not bragging of themselves so they grow
In the end only lack contending
So noone in the world is able to be contending with them.

In ancient times there was a saying,
That which is flexible becomes whole.
How can these be empty words?

The essence, whole yet being merged together.
