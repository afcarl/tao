The tao entirely lacks a name
Although its true nature is tiny
Noone in the world is able to methodize it either.

If nobles and kings are able to keep to it
The 10000 things attain self-spontaneity
The heavens and earth join with each other and it rains sweet dew
It is the command of noone but people cooperate.

Once measuring begins names are present
Names are also grasped and possessed
In the end the knowledge of stopping also follows
With knowledge of stopping lack of danger can happen.

Analogically, tao being in the world
Is just like how the streams and valleys relate to rivers and seas.
