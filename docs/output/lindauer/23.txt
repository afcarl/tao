Rare words are natural.
So the fluttering winds do not last all morning
The sudden rainstorm does not last all day.
Who is it that acts this way?
Heavens and earth.

Heavens and earth still lack the ability for longevity
Yet what relates to men is equal to this state of things?

So follow effort in things related to tao
Be together with relating to tao
Follow effort in things related to the ideal
Be together with relating to the ideal
Follow effort in things related to losing
Be together with relating to losing.

What is together with things related to tao
Tao also obtains joyfully
What is together with things related to the ideal
The ideal also obtains joyfully
What is together with things related to losing
Losing also obtains joyfully.

Belief without enough within
A lack of belief in what is within happens.
