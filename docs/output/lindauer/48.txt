Act academic, daily gain
Act tao, daily lose.
Losing, again lose
It happens, reaching relating to the absence of acting
Absence of acting yet absence of being without acting.

Grabbing the world, an entire absence of effort happens
Liking entirely the presence of effort
Is insufficient to precede grabbing the world.
