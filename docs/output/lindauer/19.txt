Break away from sageliness, toss out wisdom
People benefit one hundred times over
Break away from humanity, toss out morality
People return to filial devotion and mothering
Break away from valuing, toss out profit
Thieves and robbers are not in existence.

These three used as a basis for action are ornament, insufficient.

So make present what principles?
See plainness
Embrace true nature
Reduce self-interest
Limit desires.
