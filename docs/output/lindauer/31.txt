In the end those with fine strategies lack the tools of fortune
They have things which are somehow disliked
So those who are present with tao are not dwelling in them.

The master-child resides in and comes to treasure the left
Using strategy, come to treasure the right
Those with strategy lack the tools of fortune
They have not the tools of the master-child
When using them in the absence of a foreseeable need
Uncaring, indifferent actions are better.

Conquer yet without embellishing
Yet those who are embellishing justify joy in slaughtering men
In the end those who are joyful in slaughtering men
Cannot come to achieve their aspired relation with the world.
