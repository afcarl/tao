A tiny nation, few people
Suppose the presence of 10 or one hundred times too many tools
Yet they are unused
Suppose people heavy with death
Yet lack moving far.

Even present with boats and carriages
There is an absence of a place to be riding
Even present with armor and weapons
There is an absence of a place to be displaying them.

Suppose men return to knotting cords and using them
What is eaten is sweet
What serves as clothing is beautiful
What is a home is peaceful
What is common is joyful.

Nearby nations overlook each other
Crowing, barking sounds are heard by each other
People reach old age and die
Without coming and going between each other.
