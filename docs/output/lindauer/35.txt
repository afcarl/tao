Take hold of the great form
The world comes toward
Comes toward without harm
Peace and stability in the extreme.

Music and handing out dainties
Passing guests stop
Things belonging with tao expressed
Its blandness is equal to its lack of flavor.

Observing lacks enough sight
Listening lacks enough hearing
Using lacks enough grasp.
