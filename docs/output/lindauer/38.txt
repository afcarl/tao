Higher ideal lacks ideal
Appropriately presence of the ideal happens
Lower ideal lacks a loss of ideal
Appropriately absence of the ideal happens.

Higher ideal is absent of acting yet absent of causing acting
Lower ideal is acting yet present with causing acting.

Higher humanity is acting yet absent of causing acting
Higher morality is acting yet present with causing acting
Higher propriety is acting yet the response of noone appears
Next comes grabbing the arm yet throwing it aside.

So lose tao yet back ideal
Lose ideal yet back humanity
Lose humanity yet back morality
Lose morality yet back propriety.

In the end those with propriety
Have loyal belief without warmth yet the leader of being confused
Those with knowledge of what comes next
The flower of Tao yet the origin of being fooled.

Appropriately it happens that the great husband
Dwells in what is spread thickly, not residing in what lacks warmth
Dwells in the fruit, not residing in the flower.

So detach from that, grab this.
