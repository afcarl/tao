Holding yet being full
Lacks compare to not yet being so
A sword blade being oversharpened
Cannot long remain so
A living room full of gold and jade
There is noone able to guard it
Abundant treasures yet arrogance
Self-condemnation, self-punishment.

Outstanding service performed
The body withdrawing
The tao of the heavens.
