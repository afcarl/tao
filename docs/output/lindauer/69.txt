Strategists possess words
I am without venturing to act as lord yet act as guest
Without venturing to enter an inch yet fall back a foot.

Appropriately called
Going absent of going
Grabbing absent of an arm
Throwing absent of opposition
Taking hold of absent of an enemy.

No misfortune is greater than relating to light opposition
Light opposition severs and destroys my principles.

So when opposing strategies escalate each other
Conquering goes with those who mourn.
