Life going out, death entering
There is living following 13
There is dying following 13.
The life of man strives toward the realm of death, also 13.

Why is it so in the end?
It happens, it is life lived thickly.

As a fact it is well known that those skilled in preserving life
Travel the land without running into rhinos and tigers
The militia enters and the strategy is to lack armor.

The rhino is absent of a place to thrust its horn
The tiger is absent of a place to affix its claw
The army is absent of a place to admit its blade.

Why is it so in the end?
It happens, they are absent of the realm of death.
