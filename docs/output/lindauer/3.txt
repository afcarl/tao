Being without esteem for principles
Results in people who do not contend
Being without treasuring goods difficult to obtain
Results in people who do not act as thieves
Being without seeing what one can desire
Results in the minds of people not being confused.

Baring the mind
Solidifying the center
Lessening the will
Strengthening self-nature

These entirely result in people
Who are absent of knowing and absent of desire
In the end they also result in the wise not venturing to act.

Acting absent of acting
An absence of being without governing follows.
