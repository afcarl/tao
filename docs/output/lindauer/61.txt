Those which are great nations flow and spread lower
The intersection of the world
The female of the world.

The female entirely conquers the male through stillness
It happens that stillness acts lower.

So when a great nation is lower than a tiny nation
It next grabs the tiny nation
When a tiny nation is lower than a great nation
It next grabs the great nation.

So some are lower and it happens they grab
Some are lower and yet they grab.

Without fail a great nation desires to bring together and rear others
Without fail a tiny nation desires to enter into the efforts of others.

In the end for both of these to acquire their desired position
Those which are great appropriately act low.
