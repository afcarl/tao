The world is present of an origin
It happens that this acts as the mother of the world.

Grasp and hold what is the mother
Knowledge of what is the child happens
Grasp knowledge of what is the child
Return, keep to what is the mother
Till the end the body lacks danger.

Cork its bottle
Obstruct its door
Eventually the body lacks straining.

Open its bottle
Complete its effort
Eventually the body lacks hope.

Seeing the small say luminous
Keeping to yielding say strong
Using what is bright
Return, merge with what is luminous.

An absence of offering bodily misfortune as a gift
Is appropriately called learning entirely.
