The life of man is also yielding, weak
His death is also rigid, unyielding.
The 10000 things, the grass and trees
Their living is also yielding, fragile
Their dying is also dried up, withered.
So that which is rigid, unyielding is the pupil of dying
That which is yielding, weak is the pupil of living

Appropriately it happens that
With unyielding soldiers, next comes lack of conquering
With an unyielding tree, next comes being attacked.

Dwelling in the unyielding and great is worse
Dwelling in the yielding and supple is better.
