Being observed, lacking sight
Say the name smooth
Being listened to, lacking hearing
Say the name rare
Being pounced on, lacking obtainment
Say the name small.

That which these three describes cannot be resolved
So they mingle yet act as one.

What is high lacks brightness
What is low lacks darkness
Restrictions and restraints cannot be named
Return, merge with, relate to the absence of things.

It is an appropriate action to call it
The absence of being shape's shape
The absence of being thing's form.

It is appropriately called ungraspable, elusive
Moving toward it there is no seeing a head
Following it there is no seeing a tail.

Holding the tao of the ancients
Warding off presence of the now happens
The ability to know the ancient beginnings
Is appropriately called a bond to tao.
