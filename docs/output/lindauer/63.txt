Acting absent of acting
Effort absent of effort
Tasting absent of tasting
Great, small, abundant, few
Repay hatred, ideal happens.

Planning the difficult relates to what is easy
Acting great relates to what is small
The difficult efforts of the world seed doing related to what is easy
The great efforts of the world seed doing related to what is small.

Appropriately it happens
That sages eventually lack great action
So they are able to perfect what is great.

In the end light promises seed scanty belief
Abundant easiness seeds abundant difficulty.

Appropriately it happens
That sages see all things as being equally difficult
So eventually an absence of difficulty is with them.
