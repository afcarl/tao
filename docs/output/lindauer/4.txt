Tao, like an empty bowl
Being used somehow lacks fullness.

Such breadth!
It seems to be a model for the 10000 things.
Blunting what is sharp
Untying what is tangled
Harmonizing what is bright
Being together with the dusty earth.

Such depth!
It seems to somehow exist.
I have no knowledge whose child it is
It appears to precede the emperors.
