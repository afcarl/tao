Supposing myself to have as little knowledge as I do
I am doing things relating to great tao
It alone imposes appropriate respect.

Great tao is very even yet people are fond of byways
Courts are very divided
Fields are very weedy
Granaries are very empty
Clothes are ornamented and patterned
Sharp swords are worn
Food and drink satiate
Money and goods are present in surplus.

Appropriately called robbery, extravagance
This way is also not tao.
