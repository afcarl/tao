From old those which are with one:
Heavens with one, settling happens
Earth with one, a direction happens
Spirit with one, animation happens
Valley with one, fullness happens
The 10000 things with one, giving birth happens
Nobles and kings with one, pure action in the world happens.

These are the results:
Heavens absent of settling will, I am afraid, crack
Earth absent of direction will, I am afraid, shake
Spirit absent of animation will, I am afraid, fall asleep
Valley absent of fullness will, I am afraid, be used up
The 10000 things absent of giving birth will, I am afraid, die off
Nobles and kings absent of pure action will, I am afraid, be set back.

So it happens that the common acts as a root to the treasured
The lower acts as a base to the higher.

Appropriately it happens
That kings and nobles call themselves orphaned, widowed, unfavored.
Does it not happen that the common acts as root to the anomalous?
Are not these the same?

So incur praise absent of praising
Be without desiring to tinkle, tinkle, as if jade
Clatter, clatter, as if stone.
