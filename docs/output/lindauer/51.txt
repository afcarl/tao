Tao is giving birth
Ideal is raising
Things are embodying
The environment is perfecting.

Appropriately it happens that of the 10000 things
None lack venerating tao yet treasuring ideal.

The venerability of tao, the treasurability of the ideal
In the end it is the command of noone yet it is entirely natural.

So tao is giving birth
Ideal is raising
Growing, rearing, balancing, maturing, deepening, enveloping.

Giving birth yet without possessing
Acting yet without relying
Growing yet without directing
Appropriately called insightful ideal.
