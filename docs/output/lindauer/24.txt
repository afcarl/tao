Those on tiptoe are not standing firmly
Those who stride are not moving
Those who show themselves are not luminous
Those who justify themselves are not conspicuous
Those who boast of themselves are not of outstanding service
Those who brag of themselves are not growing.

They that join tao also say
Surplus food and redundant actions are somehow disliked

So those present with tao are not dwelling there.
