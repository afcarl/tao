Those ancients who valued acting in tao
Did not come to be luminous
People attaining it came to be foolish.

The difficulty with governing people?
It happens that what is wise is abundant.
So if it happens that wisdom governs the nation
It is the enemy of the nation
If it does not happen that wisdom governs the nation
It is the good luck of the nation

Those who know both these things
Also investigate the patterns of entireness
To know and investigate patterns
Is appropriately called insightful ideal.

Insightful ideal goes with the penetrating, with the far-reaching

With it things go with turning back
And will reach the great alignment.
