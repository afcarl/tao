Sages are entirely absent of mind
It happens that the mind of the one hundred families acts as a mind.

Those who are valued I am valuing
Those who lack value I also am valuing
Ideal valuing.
Those who are believed I am believing
Those who are not believed I also am believing
Ideal believing.

Sages in the world inhale
Inhale, act, mix with the mind of the world.

The one hundred families concentrate their ears and eyes
Sages are each being children.
