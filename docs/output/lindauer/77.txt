The tao of the heavens, it is just like opening up a bow
With that which towers being restrained
That which is lowered being lifted
That which has surplus being decreased
That which lacks enough being supplemented.

The tao of the heavens
Decreasing in the presence of surplus
Yet supplementing what lacks enough.

The tao of man, and then it lacks being so
Reducing what lacks enough
Coming to esteem the presence of surplus.

Who is able to come to esteem presence of surplus in the world?
Only those present with tao.

Appropriately it happens that sages
Act yet without relying
Are of outstanding service yet without dwelling therein

They lack desire to display principles.
