Those who know men are wise
Those with self-knowledge are luminous
Those who conquer others possess strength
Those who conquer themselves possess force
Those with knowledge of enough are wealthy
Those who strive to go possess aspiration
Those who are not losing their place are long-lasting
Those who die yet without perishing are long-lived.
