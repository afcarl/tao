The hunger of people
It happens that those above feed by taxing abundantly
Appropriately hunger happens.

The difficulty in governing people
It happens that those above possess action
Appropriately the difficulty in governing happens.

The lightness of people at death
It happens that those above reach for the thickness of life
Appropriately lightness at death happens.

In the end only those who are absent of acting to live
Are appropriately wise in relating to treasuring life.
