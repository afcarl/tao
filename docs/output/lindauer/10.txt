In containing life-force and embracing oneness
Is the ability to be absent from departing equal?
In gently extending animus alone
Is the ability to be as a newborn child equal?
In cleansing and clearing insightful discernment
Is the ability to be absent of flaws equal?
In fondness for people, governing a nation
Is the ability to be absent of action equal?
In opening and closing the gate of heavens
Is the ability to be absent of femaleness equal?
In seeing clearly all four reaches
Is the ability to be absent from knowledge equal?

Be giving birth, be nourishing.

Giving birth yet without possessing
Acting yet without sustaining
Growing yet without directing
Is appropriately called insightful ideal.
