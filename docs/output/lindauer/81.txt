Believed words lack embellishment
Embellished words lack belief.

Those who value lack argument
Those who argue lack valuing
Those who know lack learning
Those who learn lack knowing.

The sages are without accumulating
Grasping, it happens they act
Others later gain presence
Grasping, it happens they give
Others later gain abundance.

The tao of the heavens
Benefitting yet without spoiling
The tao of the sages
Acting yet without contending.
