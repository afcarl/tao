Holding the richness of the ideal in the mouth
Compares to relating to a newborn child.
Poisonous bugs are without stinging
Fierce animals are without grasping
Birds of prey are without pouncing.

There are weak bones and yielding tendons, yet a firm grasp
The male does not yet know union with the female
Yet its virility is strong
It has essence even at the extreme.
Screaming all day yet without being hoarse
Harmonizing even at the extreme.

Knowing harmony say entireness
Knowing entireness say luminous
In accord with giving birth say happy
The mind results in animus, say strong.

Things reach the prime and then grow old?
What is called this is without tao.
What is without tao comes to an early end.
