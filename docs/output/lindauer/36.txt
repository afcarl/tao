Attain the desire for inhaling
Firmly seed exhaling
Attain the desire of lessening
Firmly seed strengthening
Attain the desire of discarding
Firmly seed allowing back
Attain the desire of taking by force
Firmly seed giving away
Appropriately called subtle luminance.

Yielding conquers the firm
Lessening conquers the strong.
Fish cannot escape relating to deep water
A direction for man cannot happen with tools benefitting a nation.
