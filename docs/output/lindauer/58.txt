They who administrate are covered, muffled
Their people are pure, honest
They who administrate are exacting, scrutinizing
Their people are incomplete, deficient.

Such misfortune!
The place of happiness place is to lean upon it
Such happiness!
The place of misfortune is to be suppressed.

Who knows its limit?
It is absent from the correct.

The correct returns, acting surprising
The valued returns, acting as evil spirits.

The dirt in the eye of men,
It is solid, everyday, long-lasting.

Appropriately it happens that sages are
Square yet without cutting
Pointed yet without piercing
Straight yet not unbridled
Bright yet not dazzling.
