Emerging is being born; entering is dying. Three out of ten are disciples of life. Three out of ten are disciples of death. Three out of ten move in the course of their lives toward the realm of death. For what reason? Because they would augment the richness of life. Now I have heard that those who are good at aiding life when travelling on land do not encounter rhinoceroses and tigers. When they enter armed conflict they need not bear arms or armour. There is nowhere for the rhinoceros to gore with its horn. The tiger finds no place to sink its claws. Weapons find no place to lodge their blades. Why? Because there is no death-place in him.
