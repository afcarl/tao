When the great Dao is abandoned there then appear benevolence and righteousness. When intelligence and knowledge come into being there then appears great artifice. When the six kinds of kin are no longer in harmony then filial piety and parental compassion appear. When the realm is in disorder then there come to be loyal ministers.
