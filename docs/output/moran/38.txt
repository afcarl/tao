The highest virtue is not virtuous and for that reason has [true] virtue. The lesser virtue does not lose virtue and for that reason does not have [true] virtue. The highest virtue does not engage in [forceful] activity and so uses nothing to do things. <The lesser virtue does things and uses something to do so.> The highest benevolence does things and does so by means of nothing. The highest righteousness does things and does so by means of something. The highest propriety does things and if nothing responds to what it does then it thrusts out its forearms and forces them. So after the Dao is lost there is virtue. After virtue is lost, there is benevolence. After benevolence is lost, there is righteousness. After righteousness is lost, there is propriety. Now propriety is the husk of faithfulness and trust and the beginning of disorder. The initial discernments are the detritus of the Dao and the beginnings of ignorance. For this reason the great man abides in the substantial parts and does not tarry in the husk. He abides in the solid parts and does not tarry in the detritus. So he rejects that and accepts this.
