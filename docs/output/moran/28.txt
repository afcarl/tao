Know the male, but keep to the female and be thus a valley to the world. When one is a valley to the world, the constant virtue will not desert one and one will return to the state of being an infant. Know the white but keep to the black and be thus a model to the world. If one is a model to the world, then the constant virtue will not decline and you will return to the limitless. Know glory but keep to disgrace and so be a valley to the world. If one is a valley to the world then constant virtue will be sufficient and you will return to the Uncarved Block. When the Uncarved Block is cut asunder it then becomes utensils. [But] should a Sage use such a man, that person would become a senior official. Truly great fabrication does not involve cutting.
