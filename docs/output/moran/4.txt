The Dao is void, yet when it is put to use it would seem that it cannot be filled up. Abyss-like, it seems to be the ancestor of the myriad creatures. It dulls their sharpness, releases their tangles, harmonizes their brightness, and unites their dust. It is deep-entering, as though existing. I do not know whose progeny it is, but it images the state before God.
