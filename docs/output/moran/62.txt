The Dao is sanctum for the myriad creatures. It is the treasure of the good person, and what protects the person who is not good. How can people who are not good be abandoned? Beautiful words can be marketed [to people]. Fine behavior can be presented to people. So in enthroning a Son of Heaven or in installing one of the three great ministers, reverently offering a jade ceremonial disk as a preliminary to presenting a chariot and team of four is not as good as kneeling to offer this Dao. Why was this Dao esteemed in antiquity? Is it not said: "By it one attains with {out?} seeking. By it one escapes from one's transgressions?'' Therefore it is prized by the world.
