The Dao produces them. Virtue nurtures them. Creatures give them form. Power configurations bring them to completion. For that reason none of the myriad creatures fails to respect the Dao and to revere virtue. No one orders this respect for the Dao and reverence of virtue, for it always occurs of its own accord. So the Dao produces them <and virtue> cultivates them, fosters them, nurtures them, gives them refuge, gives them peace, rears them, and shelters them. It produces them without seeking to possess them and acts without exacting gratitude. It is senior to them yet does not rule over them. It is called the dark and mysterious virtue.
