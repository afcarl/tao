Everyone in the world says that my Dao is great and yet it does not seem so. Now only because it is great does it not seem so. If it seemed so, then long would it have been petty. I have three treasures that I uphold and protect: The first is called compassion, the second is called thrift, the third is not being willing to be first in the world. Being compassionate, one is able to be brave. Being thrifty one is able to be generous. Not being willing to be first in the world, one is able to become the Chief Agent [of the processes of the universe that constitute the manifestations of the Dao]. Now should one abandon compassion and yet seek to act bravely, should one abandon thrift and yet seek to be generous, or abandon one's position at the rear and yet seek to be foremost, then it will be fatal. And if one wages war with compassion then one will win. If one seeks to defend something using compassion then it will be secure. What Heaven will give salvation, it protects by means of compassion.
