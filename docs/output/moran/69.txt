There is a saying about using armed forces. "I dare not be the host (i.e., the initiator) and instead become the guest. I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.'' That is called to make troop movements without form, shoving aside without a forearm, destroying without involving an enemy, and wielding arms without there being a weapon. There is no greater disaster than underestimating one's enemy. If one were to underestimate one's enemy that would be tantamount to losing one's treasures. So when troops of equivalent strength are opposed, the side that goes into battle with sorrow will win.
