The Dao produced the One. The One produced the Two. The Two produced the Three. And the Three produced the myriad creatures. The myriad creatures bear Yin on their backs and embrace Yang. They blend lifebreaths in order to create a harmony. People abominate nothing more than to be orphaned, bereaved, and unworthy, yet the lords and kings take these [terms] as their appellations. So creatures may be worn away and thereby augmented, or they may be augmented and thereby worn away.

What other people teach I also teach: "Ruffians will come to no good end.'' I take this as my precept.
