In life people are soft and supple. In death they are hard and rigid. Among the myriad creatures, the grasses and trees in life are pliant and crisp, But in death they are brittle and withered. So the hard and rigid are the disciples of death, and the soft and supple are the disciples of life. For that reason, when armies are powerful they will not win. When trees are rigid they will be terminated. The rigid and large take the lower position while the soft and supple take the upper position.
