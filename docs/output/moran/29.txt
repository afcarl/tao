Should one desire to take the world and control it, I see that there would be no end [to one's involvement]. The world is a holy vessel and cannot be controlled. Those who try to control it harm it. Those who clutch at it lose it. For some things go before and some things follow. Some things snort and some things blow. Some things are strong and some things are puny. Some things are nurtured and others are destroyed. For that reason the Sage gets rid of extremes, extravagances, and excesses.
