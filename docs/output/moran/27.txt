Good traveling leaves no ruts. Good speech gives rise to no reproach. Good reckoning does not depend on counting slips. Good closures need no bars and yet cannot be opened. Good bonds employ no rope and yet cannot be undone. For this reason the Sage is always good at saving people and so none is abandoned. He is always good at saving creatures and so none is abandoned. [This condition] is called practicing brightness. So the good person is the teacher of those who are not good, and people who are not good are the raw materials for those who are good. Should one fail to value his teacher or fail to love his raw materials, then although he might be knowledgeable, he would be yet greatly deluded. This is spoken of as the cardinal mystery.
