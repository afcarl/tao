If one would contract something, then one must first resolutely spread it out. If one would weaken something, then one must first resolutely strengthen it. If one would have a thing be discarded one must first resolutely cause it to flourish. If one would seize something one must first resolutely give it away. This [approach] is called subtle discernment. The pliant and weak overcome the rigid and strong. [So] fish cannot leave the depths and the sharp instruments of the state cannot be shown [to threaten] the people.
