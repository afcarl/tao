Those who rise on tiptoe do not stand firm. Those who straddle as wide as possible cannot move. Those who show themselves off are not luminous. Those who justify themselves are not illustrious. Those who boast of themselves have no merit. Those who brag on themselves do not stand senior to others. In respect of the Dao, these [behaviors] are said to be leftovers and excrescences. Creatures always loath them, and so those who have the Dao do not involve themselves therewith.
