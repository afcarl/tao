The great Dao reaches everywhere without regard to direction. The myriad creatures depend on it to reproduce themselves and be born, and none are denied. When accomplishments are made [the Dao] does not claim them. It feeds and clothes the myriad creatures and does not act as their master. Constantly without desire [in regard of the myriad creatures] it can be called insignificant. The myriad creatures take refuge therein and yet it does not act as their master, so it can be called great. Because it never takes itself to be great it can therefore accomplish its own greatness.
