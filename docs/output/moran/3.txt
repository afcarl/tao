"Do not elevate the worthies, so that the people shall not contend. Do not value scarce commodities, so that the people shall not become robbers. Do not display desirable things, so that minds shall not become disordered.'' For this reason, the governance of the Sage lies in voiding the minds of the people, filling their bellies, weakening their ambitions, and strengthening their bones. The Sage always causes the people to have no knowledge and no desires and causes the ones who do know not to dare to act. Because [the Sage] engages in non-activity, there is nothing he fails to bring to order.
