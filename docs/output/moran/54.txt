What is well built cannot be pulled up. What is well clasped cannot slip free. By these means one's sons and grandsons will offer sacrifice unendingly. If it is cultivated in one's person, then virtue will be genuine. If it is cultivated in one's family, then virtue will be ample. If it is cultivated in one's local community, then virtue will be enduring. If it is cultivated in one's kingdom, then virtue will be plentiful. If it is cultivated in the world, then virtue will be universal. So observe each person in terms of that person himself, observe each family in terms of that family itself, observe each community in terms of that community itself. Observe each kingdom in terms of that kingdom itself. Observe the world in terms of the world itself. How do I know the way the world is? By this.
