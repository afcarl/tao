The highest good is like water. Water is good at benefitting the myriad creatures and does not contend. It takes its position in the places people hate, and so it approximates to the Dao.

The site makes a residence good. Depth makes a mind good. Benevolence makes giving good. Trustworthiness makes words good. Being able to put things in order makes government good. Being able to make actual accomplishments make activities good. Timeliness makes movements good.

Now only by not contending can there be the absence of animosity.
