Of those in ancient times who attained unity: Heaven attained unity in order to be pure. Earth attained unity in order to be stable. Spirits attained unity in order to be responsive. The valleys attained unity in order to be full. The myriad creatures attained unity in order to reproduce. The lords and kings attained unity in order to become the correct ones in the world. [It is unity that] brings them to this height. If Heaven did not have what it takes to be pure, it would probably become rent. If Earth did not have the means to be stable, it would probably quake. If the spirits did not have the means to be responsive, they would probably dissipate. If the valleys did not have the means to be filled, they would probably become exhausted. If the myriad creatures did not have the means to reproduce, they would probably become extinct. If the lords and kings did not have the means to be noble and exalted, they would probably fall. So the noble takes the ignoble as its base, and the high takes the low as its foundation. For this reason the lords and kings speak of themselves as the orphaned, the bereaved, and the unworthy. Is this not taking the ignoble as one's base? Is this not so? So the highest degree of good repute is to have no good repute. Be not glistening like jade [but] stony like rock.
