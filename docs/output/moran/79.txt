After harmonizing a great grievance there must remain a residue of enmity. How can that be regarded as good? For that reason the Sage takes the left portion of the contract tally rather than trying to make (contractual) demands on people. Those who have virtue take charge of [fulfilling obligations of] the contract. Those who have no virtue take charge of exaction. The Dao of Heaven has no one to whom it is close by birth. It always gives to the good person.
