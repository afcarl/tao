Everyone in the world knows the beautiful to be beautiful. Thus there is ugliness. They all know good to be good. Thus there is evil. For being and non-being are mutually produced. Difficult and easy are mutually complemented. Long and short are mutually formed. High and low are mutually opposed. Music and voice mutually harmonize. Fore and aft follow each other. For this reason, the Sage concerns himself only with affairs that involve no active doing, and carries forth a wordless teaching. The myriad creatures arise and he does not deny any of them. They are produced, yet he does not seek to possess them. He acts and yet does not claim compensation for so doing. When he brings meritorious work to completion he takes no credit for it. For only by not taking credit for these accomplishments are the fruits of his activities kept safe.
