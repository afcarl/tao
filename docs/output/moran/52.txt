The world has a beginning that acts as its mother. Once one attains to the mother, one can know the child. Having known the child, return to holding to the mother. Then one will be in no danger though one should lose one's body. Plug your orifices, close your gates, and you will be toil-free to the end of your life. If you open your orifices in order to aid in your endeavors then you will never be rescued to the end of your days. To see the minute is called discernment. To hold to the pliant is called strength. To use your inner light to return once more to discernment and thus avoid abandoning yourself to danger is to depend on the Constant.
