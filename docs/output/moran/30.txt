Those who use the Dao to aid the masters of men do not employ weapons to take the world by force. That tactic is good at recoiling upon its origin: Where armies have trodden thorns and brambles spring up. After the great armies there must follow bad years. In the case of the good use of armies, they are employed only until results are obtained and nobody dares use them to grab power. When results are obtained they dare not brag. When results are obtained they dare not boast. When results are obtained they dare not be arrogant. When results are obtained it is solely because there was no other way out. When results are obtained they do not try to dominate. When creatures come to their prime they begin to age. That is spoken of as the Dao (course) of retrograde action. What is on the retrograde Dao is soon finished.
