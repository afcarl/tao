One possessing the fullness of virtue may be compared to a newborn baby. Hornets, scorpions, vipers, and snakes cannot sting [the newborn baby]. The fierce beasts do not pounce upon it. The raptors do not sink their talons into it. The baby's bones are pliant, his muscles weak, yet his grip is firm. He has never known the coupling of male and female, yet has a full erection. That is the height of vitality. He cries the entire day yet does not become hoarse. That is the perfection of harmony. To know harmony is said to be constant. To know constancy is said to be enlightenment. To augment life is said to be inauspicious. For the heart and mind to exert compulsion on the lifebreath is said to be forcing things. When creatures come to their prime they begin to age. That is spoken of as the dao (course) of retrograde action. What is on the retrograde dao is soon finished.
