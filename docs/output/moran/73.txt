When one is brave at acting bold then one will be killed. When one is brave at not acting bold then one will live. [Of] these two [one] may involve benefit [and one may involve] injury. Who knows the reason for what Heaven hates. <For that reason the Sage treats it as especially difficult.> The Dao of Heaven does not contend and yet is good at winning, does not speak and yet is good at responding, does not summon yet things come to it of their own accord, is in repose and yet good at laying plans. The vast net of Heaven is coarse, yet nothing escapes it.
