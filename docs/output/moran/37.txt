The Dao never employs forceful action yet there is nothing it fails to do. If the lords and rulers can hold to it, then the myriad creatures will transform themselves of their own accord. Should desire rise up [even] after they have transformed, I will tranquilize it with the nameless Uncarved Block. [By reason of] the nameless Uncarved Block, the [myriad creatures] too will in future become desireless. Their having been stilled by desirelessness, the world will become settled of its own accord.
