Those of antiquity who were good at the practice of the Dao did not enlighten people---rather, they made them ignorant. The people are difficult to regulate when they are too clever. So to use cleverness to regulate a country is to do injury to the country. To not use cleverness to regulate a country is to be a benefactor to the country. Knowing these two alternatives constitutes a model. Having a constant awareness of this model is called the dark and mysterious virtue. The dark and mysterious virtue is profound and remote. It is opposed to [the ordinary inclinations of] creatures and so comes into a great confluence [with the total process of the universe].
