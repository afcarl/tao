A large country is at the low end of the watershed. It takes the role of the female in the world. In the interactions that take place in the world, the female always overcomes the male by means of her tranquility. Because of her tranquility the female is the lower one. {Therefore it is appropriate that she be lower.} So if the large country takes the lower position with regard to the smaller countries, it can then take the smaller countries. If the smaller countries take the lower position with regard to the larger country, then they can {be} take{n by} the larger country. So either one is lower in order to take, or lower in order to be taken. The larger country only desire to foster all of the people. The smaller countries only desire to enter into the service of others. Now when the two sides each have gotten what they desire, it is appropriate that the larger country still take the lower role.
