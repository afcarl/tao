Should I have the least bit of knowledge, fear only that I might use it as I set out upon the great Dao. The great Dao is very smooth, yet people prefer the shortcuts. If the court is immaculate, the fields will grow wild and the granneries will become very empty. To wear embroidered robes and strap on sharp swords, to satiate oneself with food and drink, and to have an excess of wealth and possessions [at such a time] is called banditry and excess. Oh! How such activities go against the Dao.
