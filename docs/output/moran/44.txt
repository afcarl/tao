Which is dearer to you, your [good] name or your life? Which [counts] more with you, your person or your material goods? Which is the more injurious, gain or loss? For these reasons, extreme love must involve great costs and great accumulations must involve heavy losses. Knowing when you have enough [means] no ignominy, and knowing when to stop [means] no danger, so one can long endure.
