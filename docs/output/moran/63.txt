Act by nonaction. Do by not doing. Find flavor in blandness. Magnify the small. Augment the few. Respond to enmity with virtue. Solve difficult problems while they are still easy. Do great tasks while they are yet small. The difficult problems of the world must be solved while they are still easy. The great tasks of the world must be done while they are still small. For this reason the Sage never undertakes great projects, and so he can accomplish great things. When acquiescence is given lightly, trust must be diminished. When things are oversimplified, difficulty must be magnified. So the Sage treats things as even more difficult [than they would seem to be], and [so] in the end there is no difficulty.
