My words are extremely easy to know and extremely easy to put into practice. No one in the world is able to know them or to put them into operation. [My] sayings have ancestors, and events have rulers. Now only because they do not know them do they not (know =) understand me. Those who know me are few, and so I am precious. For that reason the Sage cloaks himself with a rough garment and holds his jade to his bosom.
