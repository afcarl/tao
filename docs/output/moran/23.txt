To be taciturn is the way of nature. For a gale cannot last the whole morning. A torrential rain cannot last the entire day. What makes them? Heaven and Earth. How can humans make things endure for long when not even Heaven and Earth can do so? So in engaging in activities, those who act in accord with the Dao are akin to the Dao, those who act in accord with Virtue are akin to Virtue, and those who act in accord with Loss are akin to Loss. Those who act in accord with the Dao are welcomed by the Dao. Those who act in accord with Virtue are welcomed by Virtue. Those who act in accord with Loss are welcomed by Loss.

"When trust is inadequate, there will be untrustworthiness.''
