Diminish the size and population of a country. Let them have the utensils of squads and platoons yet be unwilling to use them. Let the people take death as a serious matter and so not venture far away, and even though they have boats and carts, not ride in them. Even though they have shields and edged weapons, let them not ever display them. Let the people revert to recording information by knotting cords. Let them relish their food, find their clothing beautiful, be content with their dwellings, and take joy in their customs. Although they be within sight of neighboring kingdoms, so that they can hear each others' dogs and roosters, let them never visit back and forth all the days of their lives.
