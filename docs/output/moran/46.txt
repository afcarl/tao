When the Dao prevails in the world, fleet-footed horses are turned back [to the fields] in order to fertilize them. When the Dao does not prevail in the world, war horses are foaled in the outskirts of the cities. {There is no greater transgression than condoning desire.) There is no greater disaster than failing to know when you have enough. There is no greater retribution than acquisitiveness. So the adequacy of knowing when you have enough is [itself] a constant adequacy.
