The five colors blind people's eyes. The five notes of the scale deafen people's ears. The five flavors make people's palates go stale. Galloping about and hunting deranges people's minds. Scarce commodities make people do injurious deeds. For this reason the Sage acts for the belly and not for the eyes. So he gets rid of that and takes this.
