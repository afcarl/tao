The greatest accomplishment seems to have imperfections, yet there is no impairment in its function. The greatest fullness is like vacuity, yet in use it is never exhausted. The greatest straightness is like crookedness. The greatest knack is like clumsiness. The greatest eloquence is like stumbling speech. Agitation overcomes the cold, tranquility overcomes the heat. The pure and tranquil are the correct ones in the world.
