Trustworthy words are not fine-sounding, and fine-sounding words are not trustworthy. Good people do not engage in disputation, and those who engage in disputation are not good people. Those who are wise are not erudite, and those who are erudite are not wise. The Sage does not accumulate things. Since what he does is for the people he has more than enough for himself. Since he gives things to the people he has even more himself. The Dao of Heaven benefits and does not injure. The Dao of the Sage does things and does not contend.
