Promote the heights of vacuity. Preserve the wholesomeness of tranquility. The myriad creatures arise side by side and [prepared by having maintained vacuity and tranquility] I observe their recapitulations. For these creatures in profusion each return once more to their root. To return to the root is called tranquility, which in turn is called submitting again to Heaven's mandate. Returning to Heaven's mandate is called being constant. Knowing the constant is called enlightenment. Should one not know the constant, one would wantonly commit evil deeds. By knowing the constant one can accept. By accepting one is impartial. By being impartial one is kingly. By being kingly one is in concord with Heaven. By being in concord with Heaven one is on the Dao. By being on the Dao one is long-lasting, and even though one should lose one's body one would not be endangered.
