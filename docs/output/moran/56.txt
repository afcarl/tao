Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know. [So:] Stop up your orifices. Close your doors. Blunt your sharpness. Release your tangles. Harmonize your lights. Make same your dust. So doing is called the dark and mysterious identity. Therefore [those who have attained to the mysterious identity] cannot be made to be intimate, and they cannot be alienated. They cannot be benefited, and they cannot be injured. They cannot be ennobled, and they cannot suffer degradation. Therefore they are noble among all those in the world.
