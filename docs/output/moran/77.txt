The Dao of Heaven (i.e., the process of the universe) is like the drawing of a bow---the high end [of the bow] is pulled down and the low end is pulled up. What has an excess is depleted and what is inadequate is augmented. The Dao of Heaven works to deplete whatever has an excess and to augment whatever is inadequate. The dao of human beings is not this way. It depletes what is already inadequate to present to what already has an excess. Who can have a surplus to present to the world? Only those who have the Dao. For that reason the Sage acts without exacting gratitude. When his accomplishments are made he does not dwell on them, such is his unwillingness to manifest his worthiness.
