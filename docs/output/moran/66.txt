The reason that the great rivers and the seas can be the kings of the hundred valleys is that they are good at lying beneath them. Thus they can be the kings of the hundred valleys. So if one would be superior to people, one must by words put oneself beneath them. If one would lead the people, one must put one's person (i.e., interests) behind them. For that reason, although the Sage is on top, the people do not perceive him to be a burden. Although he is in front of them, the people do not take that to be an injury. So the world takes joy in pushing him to the fore and does not become tired of him. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.
