There is nothing as good as frugality for regulating the people and for serving Heaven. Now only frugality can be called an early compliance. An early compliance is spoken of as a double accumulation of virtue. When virtue is doubly accumulated, then there is nothing that is not overcome. When there is nothing that is not overcome, then no one knows your limit. When no one knows your limit, then you may possess the kingdom. When you have the mother of the kingdom, you can be long enduring. That is spoken of as the deep root, the firm-set trunk, the Way to long life and enduring vision.
