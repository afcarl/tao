Regulating a large country is like boiling small fish. When the Dao is used to oversee the world, then its negative (contractive) forces of nature will not act as positive (expansive) forces. Not [only] will its negative (contractive) forces not become positive (expansive) forces, [even] its spirits will not (pierce =) injure humans. Not [only] will its spirits not injure humans, [even] extraordinarily talented humans will not injure people. Now when these two do not injure each other, then virtuous interaction will return thereto.
