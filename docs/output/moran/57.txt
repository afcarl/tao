Govern the kingdom with uprightness. Use weapons of war with guile. Take the world by means of non-doing. How do I know the way it is? By this: If there are many prohibitions in the world, then the people will become even poorer. If the people have many sharp weapons then the kingdom will become even more chaotic. If the people have many tricks then abnormal things will abound. If laws and commandments proliferate, then there will be large numbers of bandits and robbers. So the Sage says: I do nothing and the people transform of their own accord. I like tranquility and the people rectify themselves. I do not (have things to do =) meddle and the people themselves prosper. I have no desires and the people themselves come to the state of the Uncarved Block.
