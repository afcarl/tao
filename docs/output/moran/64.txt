It is easy to maintain control of things while they are still quiescent. It is easy to plan for them before they have given any inkling. When things are crisp, they are easy to shear off. When things are minute, they are easily dispersed. Do it before they come into existence! Regulate them before they become disordered! A tree of two spans starts as the finest filament. A tower of nine stories begins by heaping up dirt. A journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one's feet. Those who do things defeat [their goals]. Those who clutch at things lose them. For that reason the Sage has no activity and so suffers no defeats. He clutches at nothing and so loses nothing. In pursuing their objectives the people constantly fail when they are about to succeed. If you are as careful of conclusions as you are of beginnings, then you will not ruin things. For that reason the Sage desires not to desire, and does not value scarce commodities. He learns non-learning, in order to return to what the multitudes have passed by, and thereby can aid in the natural processes of the myriad creatures without daring to act forcefully.
