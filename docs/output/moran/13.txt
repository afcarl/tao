Favor and disgrace [both] produce alarm. A source of great travail is one's self. What is meant by saying "Favor and disgrace produce alarm?'' He who is favored is someone's inferior. Receiving favor and losing it both cause alarm. That is what is meant by saying that "Favor and disgrace produce alarm.'' What is meant by saying "A source of great travail is one's self?'' The reason I [can] have a great travail is that I have a self. Should I no longer have a self then what travail could there be? So those who take their selves as more valuable than ruling the world may be given custody of the world. Those who love themselves more than ruling the world may be entrusted with the world.
