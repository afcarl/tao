"Crumpled then whole, twisted then straight, sunken-in then full, tattered then new, having little then acquiring much, having much then being made deluded''---for these reasons, the Sage embraces the One to become the standard for the world. He does not show himself off and so is luminous. He does not justify himself and so is illustrious. He does not boast of himself and so has merit. He does not brag on himself and so is senior to the rest. For only by his not being contentious does it happen that none in the world can contend with him. How could it have been empty words when the ancients said: "Crumpled then whole?'' Verily such a one shall return whole to his source.
