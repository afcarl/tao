Those of old who were good at being knight-scholars were subtle, were possessed of ineffable efficacy, and were in dark and mysterious confluence, so profound that they could not be perceived. Only because they cannot be perceived do I give them a forced description. Cautious as though crossing a [frozen] stream in wintertime, apprehensive as though in fear of people on all four sides, deferential like a guest. Riven like ice on the verge of melting. Wholesome like the Uncarved Block. Accepting like a valley. Turbid as though having been muddled. Who can be muddled in order to gradually become clear? Who can be tranquil in order that activity will gradually stir? Those who are protected in this Dao will not desire fullness. For only by not being full is one able to be tattered and yet newly complete.
