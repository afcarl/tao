If the people do not fear death, how can anyone use [the threat of] death to intimidate them? Supposing the people to be caused to be constantly in fear of death and at the same time to regard it as an unusual event---should I [be prepared to] seize and have them killed then who would dare [perform the execution]? There is always an executioner to do the killing. To take the place of the executioner to kill is said to be [like] taking the place of the great lumberman to chop wood. Now one who takes the place of the great lumberman to chop wood seldom avoids injuring his own hand.
