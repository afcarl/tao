When the superior knight-scholar hears of the Dao, he diligently puts it into practice. When the average knight-scholar hears of the Dao, it is half as though he preserves [the concept of] it in his mind and half as though it is lost. When the inferior knight-scholar hears of the Dao, he laughs uproariously at the notion. If such a one did not laugh at it, it would be something too inadequate to be the Dao. So an established saying states that the brightness of the Dao seems like darkness, the advance of the Dao seems like retreat, the level Dao seems rough, the superior virtue seems like a gully, the whitest white seems sullied, ample virtue seems inadequate, firmly established virtue seems stealthy, pristine virtue seems polluted, the greatest square has no corners, the greatest vessels are completed late, the greatest sound is inaudible, the greatest image has no form. The Dao hides itself in namelessness. Now only the Dao is good at bestowing [things upon the creatures of the world] and bringing [them] to completion.
