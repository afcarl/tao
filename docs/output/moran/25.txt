There is a thing that was turbidly formed, born before Heaven and Earth. Solitary and vacant, it stands alone and unchanging. It reaches everywhere without falling into any danger. It can be the mother of the world. I know not its taboo name. To serve as a name-for-outsiders I call it Dao, and if forced to provide a taboo name will call it the Great. Being great means going forward. Going forward means being far. Being far means turning back on itself. So the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the domain there are four greats, and the the king is one of them. Humans model themselves on Earth, Earth models itself on Heaven, Heaven models itself on the Dao, and the Dao models itself on what is as it is in itself.
