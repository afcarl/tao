Extirpate study and there will no longer be worries. What difference is there between a sound of compliance and an angry rebuff? How far is good from evil? "What people fear one cannot fail to fear.'' How wild and far off the mark! The multitudes are joyous as though partaking in the tai-lao sacrifice, or as though ascending the terraces in springtime. I alone am placid like something before there is even an inkling of it, like an infant before it has learned to smile. Dispirited, as though having no place to which to return. The multitudes all have an excess, and I alone seem to have a deficit. I have the mind of a stupid person, so chaotic. The ordinary people scintillate; I alone am muddled. The ordinary people are very prying, I alone am closed off. [They are] agitated like the sea, blown like [they] would never stop. The multitudes of people all have their goals. I alone am an obstinate fool and seem uncouth. I alone am different from others and value taking sustenance from the Mother.
