The Sage has no constant mind. He takes the minds of the common people to be his own.

Those who are good I treat as good. Those who are not good I also treat as good. Thereby I gain goodness. The trustworthy I trust. The untrustworthy I also trust. Thereby I gain trust.

The Sage is closed off in respect to the world. For the sake of the world the Sage muddles his mind. The common people all strain their eyes and ears. [Yet] the Sage treats them all as little children.
