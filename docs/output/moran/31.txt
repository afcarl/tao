Excellent weapons are inauspicious instruments. Creatures always abhor them. So those who have the Dao do not become involved with them. When the ruler resides at peace he values the left, and when he takes up arms he values the right. Arms are inauspicious instruments, not the instruments fit for a noble man. Only when there is no alternative does he resort to them. [And then] placidity and blandness are the best. He does not regard victory as glorious. Those who glorify victory exult in killing people. Now those who exult in killing people cannot achieve their aspirations in this world. For auspicious affairs one elevates the left. For inauspicious affairs one elevates the right. The lieutenant generals take their stations on the left. The full generals reside on the right. [Because the right is the side of mourning, the above discussion] means one ought to treat [military] affairs with the rites of mourning. Because of the large numbers of people who are killed, they are to be wept for with sorrow. Victory in war should be treated with the rites of mourning.
