When governance is stifled the people will be wholesome. When governance is exacting, the people will be shifty. Good fortune depends on disaster, and disaster [in turn] is concealed in good fortune. Who knows the end [of this cyclical process] or [the extent of] its irregularity? The straightforward changes into guile. Good changes into what is pernicious. This has indeed baffled people for a long time. For this reason the Sage squares yet does not cut. He is probing yet does no one injury. He is straight and yet does not force things into line. He is radiant and yet does not dazzle.
