There is nothing in the world more soft and supple than water. But nothing can surpass it for attacking the hard and rigid because there is nothing by which they can change it. None in the world fail to know that the supple overcomes the rigid and that the soft overcomes the hard, but none can put this knowledge into practice. For that reason the Sage says: He who receives the dirt of the kingdom is called the master of the shrine to Earth and Millet. He who takes up the inauspicious affairs of the kingdom is called the king of the world. Correct sayings seem to have things turned upside-down.
