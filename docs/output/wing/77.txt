The Tao in Nature
Is like a bow that is stretched.
The top is pulled down,
The bottom is raised up.
What is excessive is reduced,
What is insufficient is supplemented.

The Tao in Nature
Reduces the excessive
And supplements the insufficient.
The Tao in Man is not so;
He reduces the insufficient,
Because he serves the excessive.

Who then can use excess to serve the world?
Those who possess the Tao.

Therefore Evolved Individuals
Act without expectation,
Succeed without taking credit,
And have no desire to display their excellence.
