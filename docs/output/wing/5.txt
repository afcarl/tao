Heaven and Earth are impartial;
They regard All Things as straw dogs.
Evolved Individuals are impartial;
They regard all people as straw dogs.

Between Heaven and Earth,
The space is like a bellows.
The shape changes,
But not the form.
The more it moves,
The more it produces.

Too much talk will exhaust itself.
It is better to remain centered.
