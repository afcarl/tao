In order to deplete it,
It must be thoroughly extended.
In order to weaken it,
It must be thoroughly strengthened.
In order to reject it,
It must be thoroughly promoted.
In order to take away from it,
It must be thoroughly endowed.

This is called a Subtle Insight.
The yielding can triumph over teh inflexible;
The weak can triumph over the strong.
Fish should not be taken from deep waters;
Nor should organizations make obvious their advantages.
