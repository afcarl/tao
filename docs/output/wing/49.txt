Evolved Individuals have no fixed mind;
They make the mind of the People their mind.

To those who are good, I am good;
To those who are not good, I am also good.
Goodness is Power.

Of those who trust, I am trusting;
Of those who do not trust, I am also trusting.
Trust is Power.

The Evolved Individuals in the world
Attract the world and merge with its mind.
The People all focus their eyes and ears;
Evolved Individuals all act as infants.
