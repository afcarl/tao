The finest weapons can be the instruments of misfortune,
And thus contrary to Natural Law.
Those who possess teh Tao turn away from them.
Evolved leaders occupy and honor the left;
Those who use weapons honor the right.

Weapons are instruments of misfortune
That are used by the unevolved.
When their use is unavoidable,
The superior act with calm restraint.

Even when victorious, let there be no joy,
For such joy leads to contentment with slaughter.
Those who are content with slaughter
Cannot find fulfillment in the world.
