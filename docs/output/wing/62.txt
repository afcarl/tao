The Tao is a refuge for All Things,
The treasure of the good,
The protector of the not good.

Honor can be bought with fine words;
Others can be joined with fine conduct.
So if some are not good,
Why waste them?

In this way the Emperor is established;
The three officials are installed.
And although the large jade disc
Is preceded by a team of horses,
This is not as good as sitting,
Advancing in the Tao.

Why did those of old treasure the Tao?
Did they not say:
Seek it and it is attained;
Posses faults and they are released?
Thus it is the treasure of the world.
