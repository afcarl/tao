The Great Tao extends everywhere.
It is on the left and the right.

All Things depend on it for growth,
And it does not deny them.
It achieves its purpose,
And it does not have a name.
It clothes and cultivates All Things,
And it does not act as master.

Always without desire,
It can be named Small.
All Things merge with it,
And it does not act as master.
It can be named Great.

In the end it does not seek greatness,
And in that way the Great is achieved.
