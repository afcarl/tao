In leading people and serving Nature,
There is nothing better than moderation.
Since, indeed, moderation means yielding early;
Yielding early means accumulating Power.

When Power is accumulated,
Nothing is impossible.
When nothing is impossible,
One knows no limits.
One who knows no limits
Can possess the organization.

An organization that possesses the Mother
Can endure and advance.
This means deep roots and firm foundation:
Durability and longevity through observation of the Tao.
