Do not exalt the very gifted,
And people will not contend.
Do not trasure goods that are hard to get,
And people will not become thieves.
Do not focus on desires,
And people's minds will not be confused.

Therefore, Evolved Individuals lead others by
Opening their minds,
Reinforcing their centers,
Relaxing their desires,
Strengthening their characters.

Let the people always act without strategy or desire;
Let the clever not venture to act.
Act without action,
And nothing is without order.
