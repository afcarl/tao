The Tao produces;
Its Power supports;
Its Natural Law forms;
Its influence completes.

Thus All Things without exception
Respect the Tao and value its Power.
To respect teh Tao and value its Power -
No one demands this, and it comes naturally.

Therefore the Tao produces and its Power supports;
It advances, cultivates, comforts, matures, nourishes, and protects.

Produce but do not possess.
Act without expectation.
Advance without dominating.
These are called the Subtle Powers.
