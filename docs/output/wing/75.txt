People are hungry.
Because those above consume too much in taxes,
People are hungry.

People are difficult to lead.
Because those above interfere with them,
People are difficult to lead.

People make light of death.
Because those above deeply seek survival,
People make light of death.

Indeed, it is those who do not interfere with life
Who are capable of respecting life.
