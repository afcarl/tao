If the administration is subdued,
The people are sincere.
If the administration is exacting,
The people are deficient.

Misfortune! Good fortune supports it.
Good Fortune! Misfortune hides within.
Who knows where it ends?
Is there no order?

Order can revert to the unusual;
Good can revert to teh abnormal;
And people indeed are bewildered
For a long, long time.

Thus Evolved INdividuals are
Square without dividing;
Honest without offending;
Straightforward without straining;
Bright without dazzling.
