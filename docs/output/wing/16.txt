Attain the highest openness;
Maintain the deepest harmony.
Become a part of All Things;
In this way, I perceive the cycles.

Indeed, things are numerous;
But each cycle merges with teh source.
Merging with the source is called harmonizing;
This is known as the cycle of destiny.

The cycle of desitny is called the Absolute;
Knowing the Absolute is called insight.
To not know the Absolute
Is to recklessly become a part of misfortune.

To know the Absolute is to be tolerant.
What is tolerant becomes impartial;
What is impartial becomes powerful;
What is powerful becomes natural;
What is natural becomes Tao.

What has Tao becomes everlasting
And free from harm throughout life.
