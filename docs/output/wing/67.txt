All the world thinks that my Tao is great;
And yet it seems inconceivable.
Only its greatness makes it seem inconceivable.
If it could be conceived of,
It would have become insignificant long ago.

I have Three Treasures that support and protect;
The first is compassion.
The second is moderation.
The third is daring not to be first in the world.

With compassion one becomes courageous;
With moderation one becomes expansive.
In daring not to be first in the world,
One becomes the instrument of leadership.

Now if one is courageous without compassion,
Or expansive without moderation,
Or first without holding back,
One is doomed!

Compassion always triumphs when attacked;
It brings security when maintained.
Nature aids its leaders
By arming them with compassion.
