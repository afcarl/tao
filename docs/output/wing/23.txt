Nature rarely speaks.
Hence the whirlwind does not last a whole morning,
Nor the sudden rainstorm last a whole day.
What causes these?
Heaven and Earth.
If Heaven and Earth cannot make them long lasting,
How much less so can humans?

Thus, those who cultivate the Tao
Identify with the Tao.
Those who cultivate Power
Identify with Power.
Those who cultivate failure
Identify with failure.

Those who identify with the Tao
Are likewise welcomed by the Tao.
Those who identify with Power
Are likewise welcomed by Power.
Those who identify with failure
Are likewise welcomed by failure.

Those who lack belief
Will not in turn be believed.
