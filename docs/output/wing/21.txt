The natural expression of Power
Proceeds only through the Tao.
The Tao acts through Natural Law;
So formless, so intangible.

Intangible, formless!
At its center appears teh Image.
Formless, intangible!
At its center appears Natural Law.
Obscure, mysterious!
At its center appears teh Life Force.
The Life Force is very real;
At its center appears truth.

From ancient times to the present,
Its name ever remains,
Through the experience of the Collectie Origin.

How do I know the way of the Collective Origin?
Through this.
