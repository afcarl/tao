When people do not fear death,
How can they be threatened with death?
Suppose people fear death and still do not conform,
Who would dare seize them and put them to death?

There is always the Master Executioner who kills.
To substitute for the Master Executioner in killing
Is like substituting for the Master Carpenter who carves.
Whoever substitutes for the Master Carpenter in carving,
Rarely escapes injury to his hands.
