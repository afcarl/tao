If the greatest achievement is incomplete,
Then its usefulness is unimpaired.
If the greatest fullness is empty,
Then its usefulness is inexhaustible.

The greatest directness is flexible.
The greatest skillfulness is awkward.
The greatest eloquence is hesitant.

Agitation triumphs over the cold.
Stillness triumphs over the heated.
Clarity and stillness bring order to the world.
