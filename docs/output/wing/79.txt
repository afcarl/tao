Even when a great resentment is reconciled,
Some resentment must linger,
How can this be made good?

That is why Evolved Individuals
Hold the left side of the contract
And do not censure others.
Those with Power are in charge of the contract;
Those without Power are in charge of resolving it.

The Tao in Nature has no favorites.
It always works through the good person.
