Using only a little knowledge,
I would travel the Great Way
And fear only of letting go.
The Great Way is very even;
Yet people love the byways.

When an organization is divided,
Fields are overgrown,
Stores are empty,
Clothes are extravagant,
Sharp swords are worn,
Food and drink are excessive,
Wealth and treasure are hoarded.

This is called stealing and exaggeration
And certainly not the Way!
