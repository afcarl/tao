From old, these may have harmony with the One:

Heaven in harmony with the One becomes clear.
Earth in harmony with the One becomes stable.
Mind in harmony with the One becomes inspired.
Valleys in harmony wiht the One become full.
All Things in harmony with the One becomes creawtive.
Leaders in harmony with the One becomes incorruptible in the world.

These were attained through Oneness.

Heaven without clarity would probably crack.
Earth without stability would probably quake.
Mind without inspiration would probably sleep.
Valleys without fullness would probably dry up.
All Things without creativity would probably die off.
Leaders without incorruptible ways would probably stumble and fall.

Indeed, the high-placed stem from teh humble;
The elevated are based upon the lowly.
This is why leaders call themselves
Alone, lonely, and unfavored.
Is this not because they stem form the humble and common?
Is it not?

Therefore, attain honor without being honored.
Do not desire to shine like jade; wear ornaments as if they were stone.
