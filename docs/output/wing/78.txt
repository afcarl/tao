Nothing in the world,
Is as yielding and receptive as water;
Yet in attacking the firm and inflexible,
Nothing triumphs so well.
Because of what it is not,
This becomes easy.

The receptive triumphs over the inflexible;
The yielding triumphs over the rigid.
None in the world do not know this.
None have the ability to practice it.

Therefore Evolved Individuals say:
One who accepts the disgrace of the organization
Can be called the leader of the grain shrine.
One who accepts the misfortunes of the organization
Can be called the leader of the world.

Right words appear to reverse themselves.
