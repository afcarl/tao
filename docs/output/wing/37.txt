The Tao never acts,
And yet is never inactive.

If leaders can hold on to it,
All Things will be naturally influenced.
Influenced and yet desiring to act,
I would calm them with Nameless Simplicity.
Nameless Simplicity is likewise without desire;
And without desire there is harmony.

The world will then be naturally stabilized.
