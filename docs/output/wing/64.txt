What is at rest is easy to hold;
What is not yet begun is easy to plan.
What is thin is easy to melt;
What is minute is easy to disperse.
Deal with things before they emerge;
Put them in order before there is disorder.

A tree of many arm spans is produced from a tiny sprout.
A tower of nine stories is raised from a pile of earth.
A journey of a thousand miles begin with a footstep.

Those who act on things, spoil them;
Those who seize things, lose them.
Thus Evolved Individuals do nothing;
Hence they spoil nothing.
They seize nothing;
Hence they lose nothing.

People often spoil their work at the point of its completion.
With care at the end as well as the beginning,
No work will be spoiled.

Thus Evolved Individuals desire to be desireless
And do not treasure goods that are hard to get.
They learn without learning,
By returning to the place where the Collective Mind passes.
In this way they assist All Things naturally
Without venturing to act.
