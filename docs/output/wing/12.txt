The five colors will blind one's eye.
The five tones will deafen one's ear.
The five flavors will jade one's taste.

Racing and hunting will drange one's mind.
Goods that are hard to get will obstruct one's way.

Therefore, Evolved Individuals
Regard teh center and not the eye.
Hence they discard one and receive the other.
