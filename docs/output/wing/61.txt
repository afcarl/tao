A large organization should flow downward
To intersect with the world.
It is the female of the world.
The female always overcomes the male by stillness;
Through stillness, she makes herself low.

Thus if a large organization
Is lower than a small organization,
It can receive the small organization.
And if the small organization
Stays lower than a large organization,
It can receive the large organization.

Therefore one receives by becoming low;
Another receives by being low.

Yet what a large organization desires
Is to unite and support others.
And what a small organization desires
Is to join and serve others.

So for both to gain the position they desire,
The larger should place itself low.
