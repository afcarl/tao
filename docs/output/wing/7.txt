Heaven is eternal., the Earth everlasing.
They can be eternal and everlasting
Because they do not exist for themselves.
For that reason tehy can exist eternally.

Therefore, Evolved Individuals
Put themselves last,
And yet they are first.
Put themselves outside,
And yet they remain.

Is it not because they are without self-interest
That their interests succeed?
