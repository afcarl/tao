Gravity is the foundation of levity.
Stillness is the master of agitation.

Thus Evolved Individuals can travel the whole day
Without leaving behind their baggage.
However arresting the views,
They remain calm and unattached.
How can leaders with ten thousand chariots
Have a light-hearted position in the world?

If they are light-hearted, they lose their foundation.
If they are agitated, they lose their mastery.
