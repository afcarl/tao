Looked at but not seen:
Its name is formless.
Listened to but not heard:
Its name is soundless.
Reached for but not obtained:
Its name is intangible.

These three cannot be analyzed,
So they mingle and act as one.

Its rising is not bright;
Its setting is not dark.
Endlessly, the nameless goes on,
Merging and returning to nothingness.

That is why it is called
The form of the formless,
The image of nothingness.
That is why it is called elusive.
Confronted, its beginning is not seen.
Followed, its end is not seen.

Hold on to the ancient Tao;
Control the current reality.
Be aware of the ancient origins;
This is called the Essence of Tao.
