Those bold in daring will die;
Those bold in not daring will survive.
Of these two, either may benefit or harm.

Nature decides which is evil,
But who can know why?
Even Evolved Individuals regard this as difficult.

The Tao in Nature
Does not contend,
Yet skillfully triumphs.
Does not speak,
Yet skillfully responds.
Does not summon,
And yet attracts.
Does not hasten,
Yet skillfully designs.

Nature's network is vast, so vast,
Its mesh is coarse, yet nothing slips through.
