Discard the academic; have no anxiety.
How much difference is there between agrement and servility?
How much difference is there between good and evil?
That one should revere what others revere - how absurd and uncentered!

The Collective Mind is expansive and flourishing,
As if receiving a great sacrifice,
As if ascending a living observatory.

I alone remai uncommitted,
Like an infant who has not yet smiled,
Unattached, without a place to merge.
The Collective Mind is all-encompassing.
I alone seem to be overlooked.
I am unknowing to the core and unclear, unclear!

Ordinary people are bright and obvious;
I alone am dark and obscure.
Ordinary people are exacting and sharp;
I alone am subdued and dull.

Indifferent like the sea,
Ceaseless like a penetrating wind,
The Collective Mind is ever present.
And yet, I alone am unruly and remote.
I alone am different from the others
In treasuring nourishment from the Mother.
