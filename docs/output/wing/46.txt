When the world possesses the Tao,
Even fast horses are used for their dung.
When the world is without the Tao,
War-horses are raised in the suburbs.

There is no greater misfortune
Than not knowing what is enough.
There is no greater fault
Than desiring to acquire.

Therefore know that enough is enough.
There will always be enough.
