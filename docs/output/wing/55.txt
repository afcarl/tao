To possess Power that runs deep
Is to be like a newborn child.

Poisonous insects do not sting it,
Fierce beasts do not seize it,
Birds of prey do not strike it.

Its bones are yielding,
Its muscles are relaxed,
Its grip is strong.

It does not yet know the union of male and female,
Yet its virility is active.
Its Life Force is at its greatest.

It can scream all day,
Yet it does not become hoarse.
Its Harmony is at its greatest.

To know Harmony is called the Absolute.
To know the Absolute is called insight.
To enhance life is called propitious.
To be conscious of Influence is called strength.

Things overgrown must decline.
This is not the Tao.
What is not the Tao will soon end.
