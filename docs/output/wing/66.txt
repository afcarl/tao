The rivers and seas lead the hundred streams
Because they are skillful at staying low.
Thus they are able to lead the hundren streams.

Therefore, to rise above people,
One must, in speaking, stay below them.
To remain in front of people,
One must put onself behind them.

Therefore Evolved Individuals remain above,
And yet the people are not weighted down.
They remain in front,
And the people are not held back.

Therefore the world willingly elects them,
And yet it does not reject them.
Because they do not compete,
The world cannot compete with them.
