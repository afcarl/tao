Those who use the Tao to guide leaders
Do not use forceful strategies in the world.
Such matters tend to recoil.

Where armies are positioned,
Thorny brambles are produced.
A great military always brings years of hunger.

Those who are skillful
Succeed and then stop.
They dare not hold on with force.

They succeed and do not boast.
They succeed and do not make claims.
They succeed and are not proud.
They succeed and do not acquire in excess.
They succeed and do not force.

Things overgrown will always decline.
This is not the Tao.
What is not the Tao will soon end.
