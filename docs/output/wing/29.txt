Those who would take hold of the world and act on it,
Never, I notice, succeed.

The world is a mysterious instrument,
Not made to be handled.
Those who act on it, spoil it.
Those who seize it, lose it.

So, in Natural Law
Some lead, some follow;
Some agitate, some remain silent;
Some are firm, some are weak;
Some carry on, some lose heart.

Thus, Evolved Individuals
Avoid extremes,
Avoid extravagance,
Avoid excess.
