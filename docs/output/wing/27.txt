A good path has no ruts.
A good speech has no flaws.
A good analysis uses no schemes.

A good lock has no bar or bolt,
And yet it cannot be opened.
A good knot does not restrain,
And yet it cannot be unfastened.

Thus Evolved Individuals are always good at saving others;
Hence no one is wasted.
They are always good at saving things;
Hence nothing is Wasted.

This is called Doubling the LIght.

Therefore a good person is teh teacher of an inferior person;
And an inferior person is teh resource of a good person.
One who does not treasure a teacher, or does not cherish a resource,
Although intelligent, is greatly deluded.

This is called Significant Subtlety.
