Hold fast to the Great Image,
And all the world will come.
Yet its coming brings no harm,
Only peace and order.

When there is music together with food,
The audience will linger.
But when the Tao is expressed,
It seems without substance or flavor.

We observe and there is nothing to see.
We listen and there is nothing to hear.
We use it and it is without end.
