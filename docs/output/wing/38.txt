Superior Power is never Powerful, thus it has Power.
Inferior Power is always Powerful, thus it has no Power.
Superior Power takes no action and acts withotu motive.
Inferior Power takes action and acts with motive.

Superior philanthropy takes action and acts without motive.
Superior morality takes action and acts with motive.
Superior propriety takes action and there is no response;
So it raises its arm to project itself.

Therefore, lose the Tao and Power follows.
Lose the Power and philanthropy follows.
Lose philanthropy and morality follows.
Lose morality and propriety follows.

One who has propriety has the veneer of truth
And yet is the leader of confusion.
One who knows the future has the luster of the Tao
And yet is ignorant of its origins.

Therefore those wiht the greatest endurance
Can enter the substantial,
Not occupy its veneer;
Can enter reality,
Not occupy its luster.
Hence they discard one and receive the other.
