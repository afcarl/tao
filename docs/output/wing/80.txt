In a small organization with a few people;

Let there be ten or a hundred times
More tools than they can use.
Let the people value their lives
And yet not move far away.
Even though there are boats and carriages,
There is no occasion to use them.
Even though there are armor and weapons,
There is no occasion to display them.

Let the people again knot cords and use them.
Their food will be pleasing.
Their clothes will be fine.
Their homes will be secure.
Their customs will be joyful.

Nearby organizations may watch each other;
Their crowing and barking may be heard.
Yet the people may grow old and die
Without coming or going between them.
