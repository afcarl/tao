The highest value is like water.

The value in water benefits All Things,
And yet it does not contend.
It stays in places that others disdain,
And therefore is close to the Tao.

The value in a dwelling is location.
The value in a mind is depth.
The value in relations is benevolence.
The value in words is sincerity.
The value in leadership is order.
The value in work is competence.
The value in effort is timeliness.

Since, indeed, they do not contend,
There is no resentment.
