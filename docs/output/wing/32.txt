The Tao of the Absolute has no name.
Although infinitesimal in its Simplicity,
The world cannot master it.

If leaders would hold on to it,
All Things would naturally follow.
Heaven and Earth would unite to rain Sweet Dew,
And people would naturally cooperate without commands.

Names emerge when institutions begin.
When names emerge, know likewise to stop.
To know when to stop is to be free of danger.

The presence of the Tao in the world
Is like the valley streawm joining the rivers and seas.
