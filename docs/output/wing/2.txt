When all the world knows beauty as beauty,
There is ugliness.
When they know good as good,
Then there is evil.

In this way
Existence and nonexistence produce each other.
Difficult and easy complete each other.
Long and short contrast each other.
Pitch and tone harmonize each other.
Future and past follow each other.

Therefore, Evolved Individuals
Hold their position without effort,
Practice their philosophy without words,
Are a part of All Things and overlook nothing.
They produce but do not possess,
Act wihtout expectation,
Succeed wtihout taking credit.

Since, indeed, they take no credit, it remains with them.
