The beginning of the world
May be regarded as the Mother of the world.
To apprehend the Mother,
Know the offspring.
To know the offspring
Is to remain close to the Mother,
And free from harm throughout life.

Block the passages,
Close the doors;
In the end, life is idle.

Open the pasages,
Increase undertakings;
In the end, life is hopeless.

To perceive the small is called insight.
To remain yielding is called strength.
If, in using one's brightness,
One returns to insight,
Life will be free of misfortune.

This is called learning the Absolute.
