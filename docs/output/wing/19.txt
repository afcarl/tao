Discard the sacred, abandon strategies;
The people will benefit a hundredfold.
Discard philanthropy, abandon morality;
The people will return to natural love.
Discard cleverness, abandon the acquisitive;
The thieves will exist no longer.

However, if these three passages are inadequate,
Adhere to these principles:
Perceive purity;
Embrace simplicity;
Reduce self-interest;
Limit desires.
