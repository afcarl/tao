There was something in a state of fusion
Before Heaven and Earth were born.

Silent, vast,
Independent, and unchanging;
Working everywhere, tirelessly;
It can be regarded as Mother of the world.
I do not know its name;
The word I say is Tao.
Forced to give it a name,
I say Great.

Great means continuing.
Continuing means going far.
Going far means returning.

Therefore the Tao is Great.
Heaven and Earth are Great.
A leader is likewise Great.
In the universe there are four Greatness,
And leadership is one of them.

Humans are modeled on the earth.
The eart is modeled on heaven.
Heaven is modeled on the Tao.
The Tao is modeled on nature.
