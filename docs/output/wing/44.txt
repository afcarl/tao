Which is dearer,
Name or life?
Which means more,
Life or wealth?
Which is worse,
Gain or loss?

The stronger the attachments,
The greater the cost.
The more that is hoarded,
The deeper the loss.

Know what is enough;
Be without disgrace.
Know when to stop;
Be without danger.

In this way one lasts for a very long time.
