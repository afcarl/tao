The Tao is empty and yet useful;
Somehow it never fills up.
So profound!
It resembles the source of All Things.

It blunts the sharpness,
Unties the tangles,
And harmonizes the brightness.
It identifies with the ways of the world.

So deep!
It resembles a certain existence.
I do not know whose offspring it is,
This Image in front of the source.
