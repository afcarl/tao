Know the male,
Hold the female;
Become the world's stream.
By being teh world's streawm,
The Power will never leave.
This is returning to Infancy.

Know the white,
Hold to the black;
Become the world's pattern.
By becoming the world's pattern,
The Power will never falter.
This is returning to Limitlessness.

Know the glory,
Hold to the obscurity;
Become the world's valley.
By being the world's valley,
The Power will be sufficient.
This is returning to Simplicity.

When Simplicity is broken up,
It is made into instruments.
Evolved Individuals who employ them,
Are made into leaders.
In this way the Great System is united.
