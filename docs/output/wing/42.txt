The Tao produced the One.
The One produced the Two.
The Two produced the Three.
The Three produced All Things.

All Things carry Yin and hold to Yang;
Their blended Influence brings Harmony.

People hate to be alone, lonely, and unfavored;
And yet leaders take these names.

Thus in Natural Law
Some lose and in this way profit.
Some profit and in this way lose.

What others have taught, I also teach:
Those who are violent do not die naturally.
I will make this my chief teaching.
