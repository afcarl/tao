If the people do not fear authority,
Then authority will expand.
Do not disrespect their position;
Do not reject their lives.
Since indeed they are not rejected,
They do not reject.

Therefore, enlightened people know themselves,
But do not display themselves.
They love themselves,
But do not treasure themselves.

Hence they discard one and receive the other.
