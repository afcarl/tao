Act without action; work without effort.
Taste without savoring.
Magnify the small; increase the few.
Repay ill-will with kindness.

Plan the difficult when it is easy;
Handle the big where it is small.
The world's hardest work begins when it is easy;
The world's largest effort begins where it is small.
Evolved Individuals, finally, take no great action,
And in that way the great is achieved.

Those who commit easily, inspire little trust,
How easy to inspire hardness!
Therefore Evolved Individuals view all as difficult.
Finally they have no difficulty!
