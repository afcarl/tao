What is curved becomes whole;
What is crooked becomes straight.
What is deep becomes filled;
What is exhausted becomes refreshed.
What is small becomes attainable;
What is excessive becomes confused.

Thus Evolved Individuals hold to the One
And regard the world as their Pattern.

They do not display themselves;
Therefore they are illuminated.
They do not define themselves;
Therefore they are distinguished.
They do not make claims;
Therefore they are credited.
They do not boast;
Therefore tehy advance.

Since, indeed, they do not compete,
The world cannot compete with them.

That ancient saying: "What is curved becomes whole" -
Are these empty words?
To become whole,
Turn within.
