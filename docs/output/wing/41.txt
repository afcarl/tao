When superior leaders hear of the Tao,
They diligently try to practice it.
When average leaders hear of the Tao,
They appear both aware and unaware of it.
When inferior leaders hear of the Tao,
They roar with laughter.

Without sufficient laughter, it could not be the Tao;
Hence the long-established sayings:

The Tao illuminated appears to be obscure;
The Tao advancing apperaas to be retreating;
The Tao leveled appears to be uneven.

Superior Power appears to be low;
Great clarity appears to be spotted;
Extensive Power appears to be insufficient;
Established Power appers to be stolen;
Substantial Power appears to be spurious.

The greatest space has no corners;
The greatest talents are slowly mastered;
The greatest music has the rarest sound;
The Great Image has no form.

The Tao is hidden and nameless,
Yet it is the Tao that skillfully supports and completes.
