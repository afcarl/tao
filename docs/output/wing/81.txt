Sincere words are not embellished;
Embellished words are not sincere.
Those who are good are not defensive;
Those who are defensive are not good.
Those who know are not erudite;
Those who are erudite do not know.

Evolved Individuals do not accumulate.
The more they do for others, the more they gain;
The more they give to others, the more they possess.

The Tao of Nature
Is to serve without spoiling.
The Tao of Evolved Individuals
Is to act without contending.
