As life goes out, death comes in.

Life has thirteen paths;
Death has thirteen paths.
Human life arrives at the realm of death
Also in thirteen moves.

Why is this so?
Because life is lived lavishly.

Now, as it is well known,
Those skilled in attracting life
Can travel across the land
And not meet a rhinoceros or tiger.
When the military comes in,
Their defence cannot be attacked.

The rhinoceros is without a place to thrust its horn.
The tiger is without a place to affix its claw.
The military is without a place to admit its blade.

Why is this so?
Because they are without the realm of death.
