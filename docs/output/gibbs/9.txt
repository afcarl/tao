To grasp after until full is not as good as stopping.
Measure and fit a crossbrace; It cannot last long.

If one's hall is filled with gold and jade, it cannot be safeguarded.
If one is wealthy and honoured, pride follows; and one gifts oneself with the faults thereof.
When the work is done, retire.
This is the Tao of heaven.
