From times immemorial there have been some who have known.
There have also been those who were sympathetic, and praising.
There have been those that feared. There have been those that ridiculed.
There have been those who were not true enough,
And there have been those who were not true at all.

How valuable are the words,
"When an accomplishment is achieved and the task finished, People say it was only natural."
