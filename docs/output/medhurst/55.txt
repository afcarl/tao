Who cherishes energy in abundance is comparable to a child. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him.
His bones are weak; his sinews pliable; his grip firm; unconscious of sex, his virility is active – the excellency of his physique. He may cry all day without become hoarse – this is the consummation of harmony.
Knowledge of harmony is called “The unalterable;” knowledge of the Unalterable is called “Illumination.”
Increase of life is called infelicity, the resting of the mind in the vitality of forms is called animality.
The corporeal begins to age as it nears its prime. This indeed is not the Tao. What is not the Tao soon ends.
