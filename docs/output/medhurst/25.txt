There was a completed, amorphous something before the Heaven-Earth was born. Tranquil! Boundless!
Abiding alone and changing not! Extending everywhere without risk. It may be styled “the world-mother.”
I do not know its name, but characterize it – tae Tao. Arbitrarily forcing a name upon it I call it the Great.
Great, it may be said to be transitory. Transitory, it become remote. Remote, it returns.
The Tao, then, is great; Heaven is great; Earth is Great; a king is also great. In space there are four that are great, and the king dwells there as one of them.
Man’s standard is the earth. Earth’s standard is the Heaven. Heaven’s standard is the Tao. The Tao’s standard is spontaneity.
