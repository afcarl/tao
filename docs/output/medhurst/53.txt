When knowledge compels me to practice the supreme Tao, the danger lies in putting it into action.
The supreme Tao is a vast plain, yet the people prefer bypaths. The palace is magnificent, but the fields are full of weeds; the granaries are empty, but elegant clothes are worn; sharp two-edged swords are carried, fastidiousness in eating and drinking is displayed, many useless things are amasses â€“ this is robbery and swaggering.
This is not the Tao!
