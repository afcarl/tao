When one uses the Tao in assisting his sovereign, he will not employ arms to coerce the state. Such methods easily react.
When military camps are established. Briers and thorns flourish. When great armies have moved through the land calamities are sure to follow.
The capable are determined, but no more. They will not venture to compel; determined, but not conceited; determined, but not boastful; determined, but not arrogant; determined because it cannot be helped; determined, but not forceful.
When things reach their prime, they begin to age. This cannot be said to be the Tao. What is Not the Tao soon ends.
