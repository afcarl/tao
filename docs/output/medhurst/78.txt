Nothing is so flexible as water, yet for attacking that which is hard nothing surpasses it. There is nothing which supplants it.
The weak overcomes the strong, the soft control the hard. Everyone knows this, but no one practices it.
Hence a Sage has said – “Who bears his country’s reproach is hailed as the lord of his nation’s altars. Who bears his country’s misfortunes is called the Empire’s chief.”
Truth, when expressed in speech, appears paradoxical.
