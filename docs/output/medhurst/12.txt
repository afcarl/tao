The five colours blind men’s eyes.
The five tones deafen one’s ears.
The five flavours blunt men’s appetites.
Galloping and hunting derange men’s minds.
Articles which are rare limit the freedom of men’s actions.
On this account the holy man regards the stomach and not the eye.
He puts aside the one, that he may take the other in hand.
