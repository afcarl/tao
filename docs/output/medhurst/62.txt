The Tao has of all things the most honoured place.
It is the good manâ€™s treasure, and that which protects the bad man.
Its excellent words may be displayed before all. Its noble deeds assist all men.
Why should a man be cast aside because he is bad?
Hence when the sovereign has been enthroned, and the chief ministers have been appointed, though one escorted by a team of horses, present the jade symbol of office, it would not equal the stilling of the heart, and entering this Tao.
What is the reason that this Tao has been held in such esteem from the beginning? May we not say that is it because those who seek receive, and those who are guilty escape by its (help)? Hence it becomes the most valued things under heaven.
