Who knows men has discernment; who knows himself has illumination.
Who overcomes men has strength; who overcomes himself has determination. Who knows contentment has wealth.
Who acts vigourously has will.
Who never departs from his base, endures long; he dies, but does not perish; he lives eternally.
