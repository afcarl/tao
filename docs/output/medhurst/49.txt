The Holy Man is not inflexible, he plans according to the needs of the people.
I would return good for good. I would also return good for evil. Thus goodness operates (or “thus all become good”).
I would return trust for trust. I would also return trust for suspicion. Thus trust operates (or “thus all become trustworthy”).
The Holy Man as he dwells in the world is very apprehensive concerning it, blending his heart with the whole. Most men plan for themselves. The Holy Man treats every one as a child.
