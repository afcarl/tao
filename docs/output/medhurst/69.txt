Military commanders have a saying:
I dare not act as host but only as a guest; rather than advance an inch I would retire a foot.
This marching without moving; bearing the invisible arm; regarding the enemy as if he were not; grasping the sword that is not.
There is no calamity greater than making light of the enemy; to make light of the enemy is to endanger my retention of the treasures. Hence once the opposing forces have met it is the pitiful who conquer.
