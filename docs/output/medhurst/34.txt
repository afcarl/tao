Supreme is the Tao! All pervasive; it can be on the left hand and on the right.
All things depend on it for life, and it denies none.
Its purposes accomplished, it claims no credit.
It clothes and fosters all things, but claims no lordship.
Ever desireless, it may be named “The Indivisible.”
All things revert to it, but it claims no lordship. It may be named “The Supreme.”
Because to the end it does not seek supremacy; it is able to accomplish great things.
