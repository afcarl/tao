The recklessly rash die. The cautiously courageous live. Of these two courses it is uncertain which is advantageous and which is disadvantageous, for who can explain why heaven disapproves? Therefore even the Holy Man feels a difficulty here. This is the way of heaven:
Goodwill, which surely overcomes.
Silence, which certainly responds.
Without being summoned, spontaneously arriving.
Acting leisurely, but planning effectively.
Heavenâ€™s net spreads everywhere, wide in mesh, yet losing nothing.
