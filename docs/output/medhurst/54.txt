Who plants well will not have his work uprooted; who embraces well will not lose what he holds; the offerings of his sons and grandsons will never end.
Who thus regulates himself has virtue which is genuine; who thus regulates his household has virtue which overflows; who thus regulates his neighbourhood has virtue which excels; who thus regulates the state has virtue which abounds; who thus regulates the world has virtue which is universal.
Therefore let every man prove himself; let each household, neighbourhood, and state do the same; let the world also follow the same course.
How do I know that it must be thus with the world? By this same (which has just been said).
