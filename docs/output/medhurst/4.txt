The Tao is as emptiness, so are its operations. It resembles non-fullness.
Fathomless! It seems to be the ancestor of all form.
It removes sharpness, unravels confusion, harmonizes brightness, and becomes one with everything.
Pellucid! It bears the appearance of permanence.
I know not whose son it is. Its Noumenon was before the Lord.
