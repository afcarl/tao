Govern a great state as you would fry a small fish.
Employ the Tao to establish the Empire and the daemons will display no energy; no that they are devoid of energy, but that they will not use it to manâ€™s detriment; (further) not only will man suffer no hurt from the daemons but he will not be injured by the sages.
When neither harm, the attributes of the Tao blend and converge.
