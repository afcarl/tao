Everything has its origin in the mother of all under heaven
To know the mother the child must be perceived; the child being born the qualities of the mother must be maintained, to the end of life there will be no peril.
Close the doors of the senses, and the whole of life will be without care; open them, attend to the affairs of life and to the end deliverance will be impossible.
Perceive the germ, that is enlightenment.
Maintain weakness, that is stability.
Employ the light; revert to this enlightenment; no calamity will then be bequeathed to the body.
This is indeed to practice the unalterable.
