By steadily disciplining the animal nature, until it becomes one pointed, it is possible to establish the Indivisible.
By undivided attention to the soul, rendering it passive, it is possible to become as an infant child.
By purifying the mind of phantasms, it is possible to become without fault.
By perfecting the people, and pacifying the empire, it is possible to prove non-attachment.
By functioning on the super-physical planes, it is possible to be independent of the lower mind.
By making intuition omniscient, it is impossible to discard knowledge.
Producing! Nourishing! Developing, without self-consciousness! Acting, without seeking the fruit!
Progressing, without thinking of growth! This is the abyss of energy.
