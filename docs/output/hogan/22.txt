Learn how to stand still if you want to go places.
Learn how to kneel if you want to stand tall.
If you want wisdom, empty your mind.
If you want the world, renounce your riches.
Push yourself until you're exhausted,
and then you'll find your strength.

You can go far if you don't have anything to carry.
The more you acquire, the less you can really see.

A Master takes this to heart
and sets an example for everybody else.
She's not showing off
so people take notice.
She's not out to prove anything
so people take her at her word.
She doesn't brag about himself
but people know what she's done.
She hasn't got an agenda
but people know what she can do.
She's not out to get anybody
which is why nobody can get in her way.

"Learn how to stand still if you want to go places."
That's not as crazy as it sounds.
Get in touch with Tao, and you'll see what I mean.
