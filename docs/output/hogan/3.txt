If you toss compliments around freely,
people will waste time trying to impress you.
If you give things too much value,
you're going to get ripped off.
If you fulfill people's desires,
you'll only leave them dissatisfied.

The Master leads
by clearing the crap out of people's heads
and opening their hearts.
He lowers their aspirations
and makes them suck in their guts.
He shows people how to forget
what they know and what they want,
so nobody can push them around.
If you think you've got the answers,
he'll mess with your head.

Stop doing stuff all the time,
and watch what happens.
