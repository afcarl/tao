When the Masters take charge,
hardly anybody notices.
The next best leader is obeyed out of love.
After that, there's the leader who is obeyed out of fear.
The worst leader is the one who is hated.

Trust and respect people.
That's how you earn their trust and respect.

The Masters don't give orders;
they work with everybody else.
When the job's done,
people are amazed at what they accomplished.
