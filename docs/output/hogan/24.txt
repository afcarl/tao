Keep your feet firmly planted
unless you want to fall on your face.
Learn how to pace yourself
if you want to get anywhere.
Don't call attention to yourself
if you want people to notice your work.

Nobody respects people who always have excuses.
Nobody gives credit to people who always take it.
People who hype themselves
don't have anything else to offer.

Think of being in touch with Tao like eating at a buffet:
Put on your plate only as much as you need.
Save some for everybody else.
