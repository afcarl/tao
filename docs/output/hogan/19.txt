Get rid of sanctity.
People will understand the truth and be happier.
Get rid of morality.
People will respect each other and do what's right.
Get rid of value and profit.
People will not steal if they do not desire.

If that's not possible, go to Plan B:
Be simple. Be real.
Do your work as best you can.
Don't think about what you get for it.
Stay focused. Get rid of all your crap.
