To be light on your feet,
you need a steady mind.
If your body is active,
your mind should be relaxed.

A Master can travel long distances
and still see all her possessions.
She may be surrounded by beauty
but she isn't caught up in it.

Why should a Master scurry about thoughtlessly?
If you act lightly,
you lose your bearings.
If you act recklessly,
you lose your self-control.
