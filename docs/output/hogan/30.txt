Listen up:
If you want to be a leader who's in touch with Tao,
never use violence to achieve your goals.
Every act of violence backfires.
An army on the move leaves a trail of tears,
and a military victory always lies in ruins.

The Masters do what needs doing
and that's all they do.
Do what you have to do without arrogance or pride.
Get the job done and don't brag about it afterwards.
Do what you have to do, not for your own benefit,
but because it needs to be done.
And don't do it the way you think it should be done,
do it the way it needs to be.

The mighty will always lose their power
and any connection they ever had to Tao.
They will not last long;
if you're not right with Tao,
you might as well be dead.
