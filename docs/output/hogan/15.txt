The ancient Masters were pretty damn impressive.
They were deep. Real deep.
Words can't even begin to describe how deep they were.
You can only talk about what they were like.

They were careful, like a man walking on thin ice.
They were cautious, like a soldier behind enemy lines.
They were polite, like a guest at a party.
They moved quickly, like melting ice.
They were as plain as a block of wood.
Their minds were as wide as a valley,
and their hearts were as clear as spring water.

Can you wait for that kind of openness and clarity
before you try to understand the world?
Can you stay still until events have unfolded
before you do the right thing?

When you act without expectations,
you can accomplish great things.
