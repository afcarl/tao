With enough practice,
you could walk without leaving any footprints.
Speak without stumbling over your words.
Do complicated math problems in your head.
You could build a door with no lock
that nobody could open.
You could tie something down with no knots,
without even a rope,
and nobody could get it loose.

Masters have time to help everybody,
and ignores nobody.
They uses their resources wisely,
wasting nothing.
Some people call this "following the light."

Good people teach others
who have the potential to be good.
Brains count for nothing
if you fail to respect your teachers
or to honor the potential in others.
That's one of the most important lessons of Tao.
