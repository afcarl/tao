Tao flows in all directions.
It's in everything, but nothing can contain it.
Everything needs Tao,
so Tao provides,
and never takes credit for its work.

Everything comes from Tao,
but Tao doesn't call attention to itself.
It wants for nothing. Think nothing of it.

Everything leads to Tao,
but Tao still doesn't call attention to itself.
Pretty impressive, huh?

It doesn't strive for success. That's why it succeeds.
