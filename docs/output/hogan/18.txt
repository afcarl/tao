When people ignore Tao,
they start talking about "righteousness" and "sanctity".
When they forget what's true,
they start talking about "self-evident truths".
When they do not respect each other,
they start talking about "political correctness"
and "family values".
When the nation is unstable,
they start talking about "patriotism".
