Tao never does anything
but nothing is left undone.

If our leaders could get in touch with Tao,
the world would take care of itself.
Even if they wanted to make their own changes,
they'd be drawn back to Tao's nameless simplicity.

When our lives are that simple, we want for nothing.
We can relax, and the world becomes a better place.
