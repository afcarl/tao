Clear your head.
Stay calm.
Watch as everything happens around you.

Everything reverts to its original state, which was nothing.
And whenever something becomes nothing,
it gets right with Tao.

If you don't understand that,
you're going to screw up somewhere down the line.
If you figure it out,
you'll always know what to do.

If you get right with Tao,
you won't be afraid to die,
because you know you will.
