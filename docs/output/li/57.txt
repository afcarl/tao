Govern a state with orthodoxy;
fight a war with heterodoxy;
take the world with laissez-faire.
How do I know this is so?
Because:
The world is full of prohibitions, yet the populace is poor;
People are stacked with weapons, yet the states are in turmoil;
People are loaded with cleverness, yet strange schemes sprout;
Rules are stringent and well known, yet robbers and thieves abound.
Thus, the sage says:
Let me practice laissez-faire, and the populace self-develop;
Let me seek serenity, and the populace self-manage;
Let me be without fanfare, and the populace self-prosper;
Let me discard avarice, and the populace self-simplify.
