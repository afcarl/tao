Fame and health - which is dearer?
Health and wealth - which is more valuable?
Gain and loss - which is more damaging?
Excessive love demands large outlay.
Overabundant wealth results in heavy loss.
Thus,
knowing contentment brings about no disgrace;
knowing moderation brings about no danger.
One lasts long.
