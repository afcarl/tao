People are born and people die.
Three in ten live long;
Three in ten die young;
Three in ten move [prematurely] into death's realm.
Why so?
Because they care for their lives too well.
Those who care for themselves, it is said, are unlikely to encounter rhinoceroses or tigers on land, or face weaponry and soldiers in war.
Rhinoceroses have no occasion to use their horns;
tigers have no occasion to use their claws;
soldiers have no occasion to use their bayonets.
Why so?
Because they care for themselves to not move into death's realm.
