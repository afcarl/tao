The Grand Virtue's complexion resembles that of Direction.
Direction, as a matter substantive,
is sometimes indistinct and other times elusive.
Elusive and indistinct, there is image within;
Indistinct and elusive, there is matter within.
Minuscule and mysterious, there are particles within;
These particles are real; there is reality within.
From the present back to the past, its name is never unacknowledged;
it is the foundation of all matters.
How do I know that it is the foundation of all matters?
Through Direction.
