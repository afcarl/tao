A saying among warriors:
I dare not play host, I prefer playing guest;
I dare not advance an inch, I prefer retreating a foot.
This is formless formation,
this is defenseless advancement,
this is oppositionless encounter,
this is weaponless display.
No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy.
Underestimating the enemy verges on losing my treasures.
Thus, when two equal-size armies are in combat, the one that is grieved wins.
