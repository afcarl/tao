A matter is molded;
it comes into being before the universe, noiseless and formless.
It stands by itself, unwaveringly;
it is in motion, unendingly.
It may be the Mother to the universe.
I do not know its name.
Tentatively, [I] label it Direction and call it Grand.
Grand is unending motion;
unending motion is far-reaching;
Far-reaching is periodicity.
Thus,
Direction is grand,
the cosmos is grand,
the earth is grand,
the human is also grand.
There are four Grands in the universe, and the human is one of them.
The human follows the earth,
The earth follows the cosmos,
The cosmos follows Direction,
Direction follows Nature.
