Goodness at its best is like water.
Water benefits myriad matters but is not in competition with them.
Water stays at a level disliked by others, as if it were the Direction.
Wherever [the sage] stays, it is a good place;
whatever [the sage] thinks, it is good thought;
whomever [the sage] contacts, it is nobleness;
whatever [the sage] expresses, it is truthfulness;
however [the sage] governs, it is good administration;
whatever [the sage] does, it is good deed;
whenever [the sage] acts, it is timely action.
Being not in competition, [the sage] has no concern.
