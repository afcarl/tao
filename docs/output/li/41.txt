Hearing Direction,
a scholar with high intelligence follows it with diligence;
a scholar with average intelligence greets it with mixed seriousness and doubt;
a scholar with low intelligence ridicules it.
Direction will not be Direction without being ridiculed.
It is said:
A bright Direction appears unilluminating;
An advancing Direction appears retreating;
A straight-forward Direction appears uninviting;
Highest virtue appears as valley impoverished;
Purest white appears blemished;
Broadest virtue appears diminished;
Strong virtue appears slack;
Fine quality appears flawed;
The supreme square has no corners;
The supreme vessel is cast last;
The supreme sound is inaudible;
The supreme image is formless.
Direction is unrevealed and anonymous.
Through Direction, help is given and work is completed.
