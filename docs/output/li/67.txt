People in the world say that my Direction is grand as if without a referent.
It is because it is grand that Direction is without a referent.
Were it capable of being referenced, it would not be grand.
I have three treasures - embrace and safeguard them.
One, affection.
Two, restraint.
Three, daring not to be at the front of [the people] of the world.
With affection, one becomes courageous;
With restraint, one becomes tolerant;
Daring not to be at the front of the world, one is at the head.
One courts death if one
forsakes affection for courage,
forsakes restraint for tolerance,
forsakes humility for prominence.
With affection,
in war, one wins;
in defense, strengthens.
When cosmos comes to the rescue, it shields with affection.
