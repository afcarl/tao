To be reticent is natural.
Thus, a whirlwind does not last all morning,
a downpour does not last all day.
Why is this so?
Because this is the universe.
Even the universe cannot sustain; can humans?
Thus, one who follows Direction manages with Direction,
One who follows virtue manages with virtue,
One who does not follow Direction nor virtue manages with neither
Direction nor virtue.
One who manages with Direction is welcome by those with Direction,
One who manages with virtue is welcome by those with virtue,
One who manages with neither Direction nor virtue is welcome by those without Direction or virtue.
One lacking in trustworthiness loses [the populace's] trust.
