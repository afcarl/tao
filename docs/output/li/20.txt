Between obsequiousness and authoritativeness - what is the difference?
Between beauty and ugliness - is there a difference?
What others fear, do not be unfearful.
Uncultivated, it is because it is unfinished.
Other people are happily gathered, as if readying to partake in an exquisite banquet, to view a spring parade.
I stand alone, quietly, inconspicuously.
Innocently, as if an infant not knowing how to smile;
Aimlessly, as if a wanderer not knowing where to go.
Other people have much to spare;
I, alone, am bare.
Perhaps my foolish heart.
Common people glow;
I, alone, am in the dark.
Common people are alert;
I, alone, am stark.
Other people are skillful;
I, alone, am clumsy and bashful.
I am different from others;
I treasure being embraced by Mother.
