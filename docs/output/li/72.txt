When the populace is unafraid of threats, major threats loom.
Do not harass their neighborhood;
Do not interfere with their livelihood.
Thus, without interference, people will not interfere.
Thus, the sage knows self without self-touting, respects self without self-aggrandizement.
Thus,
forsake self-touting and self-aggrandizement;
embrace self-knowledge and self-respect.
