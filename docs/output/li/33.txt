Knowing others is wisdom;
knowing self is discernment.
Winning over others shows prowess;
winning over self shows strength.
With contentment, one is wealthy.
With persistence, one shows determination.
Holding on without losing ground, one is strong;
Dying without giving up Direction, one lives long.
