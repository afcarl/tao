My words are easy to understand and easy to put into practice.
But no one in the world understands [my words], and no one puts them into practice.
Words must be principled; actions must be justified.
Because these are not understood, I am not understood.
With few who understand me, fewer will put [my words] into practice.
Thus, a sage dresses simply but bears a jade.
