Accommodate and be whole, bend and be straight;
Keep low and be fulfilled, replace old and be new;
Seek little and gain, seek plenty and be bewildered.
Thus, the sage embraces One to set an example for the people of the world.
Not self-touting, one shines;
Not self-justifying, one reassures;
Not self-aggrandizing, one accomplishes;
Not self-serving, one endures.
When one is not in competition, people in the world cannot engage him/her in competition.
Is the old saying "Accommodate and be whole" but empty words?
It can be realized fully.
