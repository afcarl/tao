Renounce nobleness, shun righteousness - let the populace return to filiality and parental love.
Renounce scheming, shun profiteering - let robbers and thieves vanish.
The three are inadequate formulation.
Better channel [the populace] to Direction.
Welcome purity, embrace simplicity;
Minimize self-interest, reduce desire.
Renounce learning, eliminate apprehension.
