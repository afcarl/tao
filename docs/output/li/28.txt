Know steeliness, but prefer tenderness.
Be the brook to the world.
The brook to the world is never disunited from virtue.
It aims to return to infancy.
Know limelight, but prefer shadow.
Be the standard to the world.
The standard to the world never deviates from virtue.
It aims to return to the Infinite.
Know fame, but prefer humility.
Be the valley to the world.
The valley to the world is filled with virtue.
It aims to return to simplicity.
Simplicity dissipates when [a block] is carved into a vessel.
A sage diminishes when [he/she] is used as a leader.
Thus, a great system is not cut up.
