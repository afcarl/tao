One who plans to govern the people in the world with coercion is,
in my view, unlikely to succeed.
The people in the world are revered specimens,
They cannot be coerced; they cannot be dominated.
One who seeks to coerce is defeated;
One who seeks to dominate loses.
The sage practices laissez-faire.
Thus, the sage will not be defeated, the sage will not lose.
Among matters,
some lead and others follow;
some breathe slowly and others fast;
some are robust and others slim;
some play safe and others blast.
Thus,
the sage discards extremes, discards extravagances, discards excesses.
