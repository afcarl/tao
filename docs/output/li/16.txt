Aim at the supreme hollow, reach for the utmost serenity.
Matters bloom in myriad diversity.
I watch for periodicity.
Matters blossom and return to their roots.
Returning to roots leads to serenity.
Serenity leads to regeneration.
Regeneration leads to normalcy.
Knowing normalcy leads to comprehension.
Not knowing normalcy, indiscretion leads to misfortune.
Knowing normalcy is all-accommodating;
All-accommodating is non-discriminating.
Non-discriminating is all-encompassing.
All-encompassing is the cosmos.
Cosmos is Direction.
Direction is long lasting.
[One who follows Direction] is unlikely to encounter danger throughout life.
