Looking at it, it cannot be seen - label it invisible,
Listening to it, it cannot be heard - label it inaudible,
Holding onto it, it cannot be held - label it intangible.
All three are beyond comprehension; they are One.
Looking up, it is dim.
Looking down, it is dark.
It lacks clarity,
it defies a name;
it returns to Null.
This is formless form, this is imageless image.
This is elusiveness.
Confronting it, one cannot see its head;
Following it, one cannot see its tail.
Seize Direction of the past - this is to manage the Ull of the present.
Know it from the beginning - this is to understand the Direction's rhythm.
