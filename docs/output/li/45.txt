Great Perfection appears flawed; its use is endless.
Great Fullness appears less; its use is limitless.
Great Straightness appears warped,
Great Dexteriousness appears handicapped,
Great Eloquence appears reticent.
Serenity wins over rashness; coolness wins over heatedness.
Serenity governs the world.
