A great nation is like a down-stream - the feminine to the world, the rendezvous of the world.
The feminine frequently wins over the masculine with serenity.
Serenity is obsequiousness.
Thus,
a great nation, obsequious to a small nation, gains the small nation;
a small nation, obsequious to a great nation, gains the great nation.
Thus, one is obsequious in order to gain.
Or, one is obsequious because it needs to gain.
A great nation is not to be too keen on conquering.
A small nation is not to be too keen on acquiescing.
Since each gains what each desires, it is better for the great nation to be obsequious.
