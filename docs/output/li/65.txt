Men who knew Direction in olden days did not teach the populace to be clever, but teach them to be simple.
A populace that is clever is difficult to govern.
Thus,
governing with cleverness robs a state;
governing not with cleverness benefits a state.
One who knows [the difference between] these two sets the standard.
Knowing the standard at all times is Profoundest Virtue.
Profoundest Virtue is deep; it is far.
Profoundest Virtue returns matters to naturalness, to the Grand Gentleness.
