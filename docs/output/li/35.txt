Whoever embraces the Grand Image attracts people in the world.
Attracting but not discriminating, they live in peace.
Hearing music and seeing food, visitors linger.
Direction, [as a subject] for discussion, is plain and flavorless.
Looking at it, it is invisible;
Listening to it, it is inaudible;
using it, it is inexhaustible.
