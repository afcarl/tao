Earnestness is the foundation of frivolity;
serenity is in control of rashness.
Thus, a gentleman, in the course of a day, does not depart from serenity and earnestness.
He refrains from extravagance [in public] and lives plainly at home.
Why would the sovereign of a ten-thousand-carriage state govern the world with frivolity?
Frivolity loses foundation; rashness loses control.
