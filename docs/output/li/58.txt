When policies are broad, the populace live simply;
When policies are rigid, the populace complain roundly.
Facing disaster, is fortune not in the wing?
Experiencing fortune, is disaster not ready to spring?
Who knows the limit?
There is no norm.
Orthodoxy turns into heterodoxy, good turns into evil.
People have been bewildered long.
Thus,
the sage is square without infringing upon others,
fair without harming others,
straight without imposing upon others,
bright without overshadowing others.
