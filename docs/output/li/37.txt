Direction is laissez-faire at all times; it is all-permeating.
Were a Duke or a Prince to govern with Direction,
Myriad matters would develop on own volition.
As self-development degenerates into avarice in complexity,
I suppress it with Direction's simplicity.
Suppressing with Direction's simplicity,
avarice disappears.
Without avarice, serenity visits with ease;
The world self-governs in peace.
