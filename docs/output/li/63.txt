Govern with laissez-faire.
Act without fanfare.
Dine with the commonest fare.
Big begins as small; many accrue from few.
In tackling difficult tasks, first tackle those easy;
In tackling big tasks, first tackle those flimsy.
The difficult tasks of the world begin as easy;
The big tasks of the world begin as flimsy.
Thus, the sage, who never considers self big, completes many big tasks.
Thus,
promise easily made leads to promise not fulfilled;
difficulty underestimated leads to difficulty multiplied.
Thus, the sage, in treating every task as difficult, encounters no difficulties.
