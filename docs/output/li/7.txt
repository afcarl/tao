The cosmos is long.
The earth is lasting.
The reason the cosmos is long and the earth lasting is that they exist not for self-perpetuation.
Unconcerned with self-perpetuation, they perpetuate.
Thus, the sage,
by queuing himself/herself behind others, ends in being ahead;
by being unconcerned, endures.
Is it not so that the sage, without self-interest, satisfies his/her self-interest?
