One who understood Direction in olden days knew the tiniest, appreciated the profoundest, and was deep beyond [our] comprehension.
Since such a person is beyond [our] comprehension, he/she can only be described superficially:
as deliberate as approaching a deep channel in the winter,
as alert as keeping watch over bordering states,
as diplomatic as an envoy in presenting,
as graceful as ice in slow melting,
as simple as a block of uncarved wood,
as calm as a valley's mood,
as accommodating as muddy water,
as expansive as the sea,
as unending as the wind.
Who can calm the muddy to let it distill?
Who can motivate the serene to let it instill?
One who understands Direction never fills to the brim.
Not filled to the brim,
one is at ready to remove the old and substitute it with new.
