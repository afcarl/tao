One guided by Direction does not use military power to subdue the people in the world.
It boomerangs.
Where armies visit, thorns grow.
After a great war, famines follow.
One who knows war stops after the objective is reached.
He dares not flaunt power.
Reach objective, but boast not;
reach objective, but tout not;
reach objective, but show arrogance not;
Reaching objective is because there is no alternative;
Reaching objective does not call for flaunting power.
Matter withers after saturation.
This is not in line with Direction.
Not in line with Direction, early demise is the expectation.
