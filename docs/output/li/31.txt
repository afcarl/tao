Weaponry are not instruments of the good;
they are disliked by everyone.
One with Direction does not harbor them.
A gentleman,
at home, takes the left position;
in war, the right position.
Weaponry are not instruments of the good;
they are not a gentleman's instruments.
Use them only because there is no alternative;
use them with restraint.
After victory, beautify it not.
One who beautifies [war] is one who delights in killing.
One who delights in killing is unfit to be entrusted with people of the world.
On celebratory occasions, prefer left;
On sad occasions, prefer right.
The adjutant stays left;
the commander-in-chief stays right.
Thus, treat war as funeral.
Those who have killed, return with remorse.
Treat victory as funeral.
