In governing people and in taking care of the cosmos, the best is restraint.
With restraint, one is ever ready.
Ever ready, one focuses on virtue.
Focusing on virtue, one overcomes everything.
Overcoming everything, one's limit does not come into being.
With one's limit not coming into being, one gains the state.
Having the foundation to governance, one lasts long.
This is deep root and solid foundation.
This is Direction - long lasting and long living.
