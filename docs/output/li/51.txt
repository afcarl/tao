Cultivated by Direction, reared by virtue;
formed by matter, completed by interaction.
Thus, myriad matters revere Direction and value virtue.
The reason Direction is revered and virtue valued is that they do not command but let myriad matters visit Nature.
Thus,
Direction cultivates,
virtue rears, nurtures, guides, comforts, protects, cares, shelters.
Cultivating without possessing,
providing without claiming,
nurturing without dominating,
This is the Profoundest Virtue.
