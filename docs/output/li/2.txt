For [people in] the world to know [only] beauty and what is beautiful is ugly;
to know [only] goodness and what is good is not good.
Ull and Null complement in generation,
difficult and easy complement in completion;
long and short complement in form,
high and low complement in norm;
voice and sound complement in harmony,
front and rear complement in company;
- they are ever so.
Thus,
a sage practices laissez-faire governance and provides wordless instructions.
[A sage] neither interferes with myriad matters' generation,
nor takes possession of [their] cultivation,
nor expects approbation of [his/her] provision,
nor seeks acclamation for [their] accomplishments.
It is because [the sage] does not seek acclamation for [his/her] accomplishments that they do not disappear.
