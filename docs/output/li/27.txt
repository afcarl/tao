A good traveler leaves no trails;
A good speaker allows no slips;
A good planner needs no tallies;
A good carpenter needs no bolts in securing a door from opening;
A good packager needs no strings in preventing a knot from untying.
Thus,
the sage cares for everyone and abandons no one,
cares for everything and abandons nothing.
This is unrevealed wisdom.
Thus,
a good person serves as the teacher to a not-so-good person;
a not-so-good person serves as the mirror to a good person.
One who neither respects one's teacher nor cares for one's mirror, even if wise, will be bewildered.
This is the innermost intricacy.
