Receiving favor and receiving disgrace are both causes for concern,
more so than being visited by a catastrophic disease.
Why are favors and disgraces causes for concern?
Favor is beneath one.
Receiving it is a cause for concern; losing it is a cause for concern.
Why [favors and disgraces] are more a cause for concern than being visited by a catastrophic disease?
When I have a catastrophic disease,
it is inflicted upon my body.
When I am beyond my body, how can I be visited by diseases?
Thus,
when one values one's body for the good of the world,
one may be consigned with the world's care.
When one treasures one's body for the good of the world,
one may be vested with the world's care.
