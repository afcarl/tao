The cosmos's Direction is like extending a bow.
Aiming too high, it lowers;
aiming too low, it raises.
From the excessive, it takes;
to the insufficient, it augments.
The cosmos's Direction is to take from the excessive and augment the insufficient.
This is not so for the direction in humans, which is to take from the insufficient to augment the excessive.
Who is willing to augment [the insufficient of] the world with excesses?
Only ones with Direction.
Thus,
a sage provides without expecting approbation,
accomplishes without seeking acclamation,
does without flaunting wisdom.
