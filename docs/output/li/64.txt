Governing is easy when there is peace;
Planning is easy when there is time;
Nipping is easy when buds are young;
Reconciling is easy when issues are minor.
Handle matters before they come about;
Govern people before there is chaos.
A tree two-arms'-length wide grows from a seedling;
A tower nine stories high starts with a spadeful;
A journey a thousand miles long begins with a step.
The populace often fail when they are close to completing their tasks.
Be as deliberate at the end as at the beginning; then, there can be no failure.
Thus, the sage desires what others do not desire, and places no premium on rare goods.
[The sage] studies what others do not study,
and revisits people's faults.
[The sage] assists myriad matters to develop naturally but does not dare to interfere.
