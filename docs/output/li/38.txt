By not displaying one's high virtue, one is virtuous;
By parading one's little virtue, one is not virtuous.
One with high virtue follows laissez-faire with carefree ease;
One with little virtue follows laissez-faire to parade one's virtue.
One with high nobleness practices nobleness with carefree ease;
One with high righteousness practices righteousness to parade one's righteousness.
One with high Conduct decrees;
With no followers, one uses force to twist others into following.
Thus,
virtue comes to the fore when Direction is not in evidence,
nobleness comes to the fore when virtue is not in evidence,
righteousness comes to the fore when nobleness is not in evidence,
Conduct comes to the fore when righteousness is not in evidence.
Conduct comes to the fore when loyalty and trustworthiness lack;
it brings about confusion.
Foreknowledge addresses but Direction's superficialities;
it initiates folly.
Thus,
a great man seeks fullness, not lack;
seeks substance, not facade.
He forsakes the latter [Conduct and foreknowledge] and accepts the former [loyalty, trustworthiness, and Direction].
