The sea is the king to hundreds of streams.
Because it is good at lying low, it can be the king to hundreds of streams.
Thus, a sage,
desirous of being the populace's superior, must be obsequious to them;
desirous of being in front of the populace, must follow them.
Thus, a sage,
sitting high, in no way burdens the populace;
standing in front, in no way harms the populace.
Thus, the world is happy to support [the sage] and is not tired of doing so.
Because [the sage] is not in competition, the people in the world cannot engage him/her in competition.
