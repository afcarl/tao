Unite physically and mentally to embrace One.
Can one be not separated from it?
Channel energy toward tenderness.
Can one emulate the infant?
Cleanse the deep mirror within.
Can one be without blemishes?
Love the populace in governance.
Can one practice laissez-faire?
Open and close the cosmic portal.
Can one assume the feminine role?
Discern and deliberate.
Can one be ignorant?
Cultivate, rear.
Cultivate, but possess not;
Provide, but claim not;
Nurture, but dominate not.
This is the Profoundest virtue.
