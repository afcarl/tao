In the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water, yet, in combating the strong, nothing can win over it.
There is nothing to replace it.
The weak wins over the strong; the tender wins over the steely.
No one in the world is unaware of it, yet no one follows it.
Thus, the sage says:
"One accepting a state's disgrace is worthy of being her governor;
one accepting the state's misfortunes is worthy of being the king to the world."
Rightful words appear paradoxical.
