The Grand Direction permeates, left and right.
With myriad matters depending on it for growth, it declines none.
Accomplishing much, it accepts no limelight.
Nurturing myriad matters without claiming, it may be labeled Small;
Receiving myriad matters without claiming, it may be labeled Grand.
By not self-claiming Grand, it is thus Grand.
