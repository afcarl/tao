The world has a beginning; it is the mother to the world.
By knowing the mother, one knows her children.
By knowing the children, one returns to their mother.
One is without danger in life.
Stuffing channels to block portals [to avarice], one is without concern in life.
Opening channels to facilitate contact [with avarice], one is without hope in life.
Seeing the tiniest is discernment.
Holding onto tenderness is strength.
Use one's light, reflect upon one's discernment, leave nothing to one's regret.
This is Eternal Direction.
