When Grand Direction is not in evidence,
nobleness and righteousness come to the fore.
When cleverness and glibness are in view,
grand pretenses come to the fore.
When family relations are in disharmony,
filiality and parental love come to the fore.
When a state is in disarray,
loyal ministers come to the fore.
