One who knows is reticent; one who glibs is ignorant.
Stuff channels, block portals;
blunt sharpness, resolve conflicts;
harmonize brightness, mingle with dust.
This is the Profoundest Assimilation.
Thus, after gaining possession,
one does not patronize, nor slight, nor take advantage of, nor damage, nor treasure, nor debase.
Thus, one is treasured by the world.
