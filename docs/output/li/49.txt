The sage has no preconceived notion at any time;
the people's notion is the sage's notion.
I treat a person, who is good, well;
I treat a person, who is not good, also well.
This is for goodness's sake.
I trust a person who is worthy of trust;
I also trust a person who is not worthy of trust.
This is for trustworthiness's sake.
The sage, in governing the world, holds back personal notions in favor of the people's.
The sage treats the people, focusing on themselves, as infants.
