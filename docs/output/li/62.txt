Direction,
to myriad matters, is an enclosure;
to people who are good, it is a treasure;
to people who are not good, it can reassure.
Good words gain people's respect;
good deeds gain people's admiration.
Why abandon people who are not good?
Thus, when a King is enthroned, three senior positions are filled.
Though there are precious jades and speedy stallions, the best present is Direction.
Why, through the ages, is Direction so valued?
Is it not because whoever seeks it gets it, and whoever is guilty, with it, receives amnesty?
That is why it is so valued by the world.
