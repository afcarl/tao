Among those with One in the past:
The cosmos, with One, produced cleanliness;
The earth, with One, produced calmness;
A shen, with One, produced responsiveness;
The valley, with One, produced fullness;
Myriad matters, with One, generated;
A Duke or Prince, with One, at the center of the world was seated.
Extending,
The cosmos, without One and without cleanliness, would be separated;
The earth, without One and without calmness, would be barren;
A shen, without One and without responsiveness, would be deserted;
The valley, without One and without fullness, would be depleted;
Myriad matters, without One and without growth, would stall;
Dukes and princes, without One and without being in the center, would fall.
Thus,
humbleness is the root of esteem;
lowness is the foundation of height.
Thus,
a Duke or Prince calls himself My Loneliness, The Isolated Person, The Ungracious Person.
Is this not humbleness as the root of esteem?
Is it not so?
Thus, the supreme honor requires no honor.
Aim not at jade's attractiveness, but at rock's solidness.
