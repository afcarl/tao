What is well planted will not uproot;
What is firmly held will not drop.
Descendants will not discontinue remembrance ceremonies.
Cultivating it in self, virtue is true;
Cultivating it in the family, virtue overflows;
Cultivating it in the village, virtue lasts;
Cultivating it in the state, virtue is abundant;
Cultivating it in the world, virtue is universal.
Thus,
look at self through self;
look at the family through the family;
look at the village through the village;
look at the state through the state;
look at the world through the world.
How do I know the world?
Because it is so.
