One possessing virtue may be compared to an infant.
Poisonous insects will not bite, ferocious animals will not pounce,
Fetching birds will not prey.
Though weak in bones and soft in muscles, his hold is firm;
Though ignorant of union, his instrument is turgid.
This is supreme energy.
Crying all day without turning hoarse, this is supreme harmony.
Knowing harmony is normalcy;
knowing normalcy is discernment.
Enriching oneself is ominous;
overexerting oneself is ruinous.
Matter withers after saturation;
This is not in line with Direction.
Not in line with Direction, early demise is the expectation.
