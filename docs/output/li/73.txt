Courageous in accepting dare results in demise;
courageous in declining dare results in survival.
Between these two, there are advantages and disadvantages.
The cosmos has dislikes, but no one knows the reason.
It is hard even for the sage to explain.
The Direction of the cosmos,
though does not compete, is good at winning;
though wordless, is good at responding;
needs no invitation and comes on own volition;
and is at ease and is good at planning.
The cosmos's net is immense; it is loose but it does not miss.
