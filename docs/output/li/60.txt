Govern a large state is like frying a small fish.
With Direction embracing the world, ghosts become ineffective.
It is not because ghosts become ineffective;
it is because their effect becomes inoffensive.
Not only have ghosts become inoffensive;
The sage has also become inoffensive.
With the two not inflicting harm, the people are showered with virtue.
