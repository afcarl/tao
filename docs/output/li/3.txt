Where admiration is not bestowed upon the wise,
the populace will not compete for recognition.
Where premium is not placed on rare goods,
the populace will not engage in robbery.
Where desirable items are not on display,
the populace will not be tempted.
Thus,
the sage governs by cleansing [the populace's] hearts,
filling their stomachs,
taming their will,
and strengthening their bodies
- to induce the populace, in time, not to indulge in knowledge nor to cultivate avarice.
So prepared, those with wisdom dare not offer schemes, and laissez-faire governance follows.
With that, no affair is beyond governance.
