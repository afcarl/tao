At birth, one is soft and tender;
at death, hard and stiff.
At the beginning, flora are tender and crisp;
at the end, brittle and dry.
Thus, hardness and stiffness symbolize death; softness and tenderness, life.
Thus, an army, hard and stiff, is annihilated; a tree, hard and stiff, is cut.
Hard and stiff are inferior; soft and tender, superior.
