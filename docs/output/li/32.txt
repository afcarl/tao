Direction frequently needs no name.
It is simple.
It is small.
Still, it submits to nothing in the world.
Were a Duke or a Prince to embrace Direction,
myriad matters would submit on own volition.
With the cosmos and the earth in harmony, sweet dew accrues.
It self-regulates without the need of intervention.
As the system begins, names are assigned.
When names are assigned, know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop averts danger.
Direction in relation to people of the world is like the sea to rivers.
