My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice.
The World is unable to understand, unable to practice.

Words have a history, Deeds have a master.
Alas, only because of ignorance am I misunderstood.

Those who understand me are rare.
Those who imitate me are honorable.

Thus does the Wise Man bear rags on his back and Jade in his heart.
