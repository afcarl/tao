Tao creates, Virtue provides,
Matter assumes form, Power completes.
Thus do all things without exception honor Tao and praise Virtue.

Honor Tao. Praise Virtue.
Not by command, but continually and naturally.

Therefore Tao creates, Virtue provides,
by raising, nurturing, sheltering, nourishing, feeding, and clothing.

Create and do not possess.
Govern, and do not exploit.
Lead, and do not kill.

This is Mystic Virtue.
