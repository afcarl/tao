The greatest Good is like water.
The Goodness of Water benefits all things without struggle;
like Tao, choosing places men avoid.

A good dwelling has land.
A good mind is profound.

Good relations are benevolent.
Good speech is true.
Good leaders take charge.
Good actions are skillful.
Good movement is well timed.

Heaven alone is beyond dispute, and therefore blameless.
