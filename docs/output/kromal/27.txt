A good journey leaves no tracks.
A good speech has no mistakes.
Good counting uses no tally sticks.

Good closure requires no latch bolt, yet does not open.
Good joints need no rope, yet do not loosen.

Thus does the wise man help others, not forsake them;
improve things, not neglect them.
Thus is understanding passed on.

The better man is the lesser man's teacher.
The lesser man is the better man's occupation.

One who does not esteem his teacher,
one who does not cherish his profession,
though wise, will be greatly confused.

This is an important secret.
