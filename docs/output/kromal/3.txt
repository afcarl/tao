Do not esteem Wisdom, and people will not argue.
Do not covet unobtainable goods, and people will not steal.
Do not harbor desires, and peoples' hearts will not be confused.

Thus does the wise man govern.
Empty the mind and fill the stomach.
Weaken the ambition and strengthen the body.

Often, if people are ignorant, they have no motivation,
and when informed will not venture to act.

Govern without acting.
Rule without administration.
