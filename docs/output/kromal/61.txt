A large country is a floodplain,
the confluence of the world,
the female of the world.

The female passively overcomes the male,
passively keeps low.

The large country that keeps below the small country, acquires the small
country.
The small country that keeps below the large country, acquires the large
country.
Therefore, either keep low to acquire, or keep low to be acquired.

The large country, not mistakenly, wants to expand its settlements.
The small country, not mistakenly, wants to join the affairs of men.
So together each gets what it wants.

The larger one quite properly keeps low.
