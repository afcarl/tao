When there is Tao under Heaven, loose horses manure the fields.
When Tao is absent under Heaven, war horses are bred on the borders.

There is no misfortune so great as not recognizing excess.
There is no mistake so great as the desire to obtain.

Therefore feel content, be content, and stay content.
