One who assists his Master with the Way,
will not foster war upon the World.
Such matters easily recoil.

Where Armies go, thorny brambles grow.
Bad years follow great armies.

The Good succeed and stop, not daring to hold by force.

Succeed, but do not gloat.
Succeed, but do not boast.
Succeed, but do not humiliate.

If you succeed and cannot stop, seek Victory without force.
Strength will wane.
This is not the Way; and what is not the Way will soon end.
