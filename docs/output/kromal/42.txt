The Way creates one.
One creates two.
Two creates three.
Three creates all things.

All things carry Yin and embrace Yang; both forces blend.

Men dislike being Orphaned, Widowed and Unlucky, as the Kingship declares
itself.
Thus one may gain by losing, or lose by gaining.

What others teach, I also teach.
The strong need not die.

I teach survival.
