People do not fear Death.
If it cannot be avoided, why should Death be feared ?

It would seem that if people normally fear Death, and behave badly,
I should capture and execute them.

Who would dare ?

Normally, government executioners do the killing.
Now, to replace them is to substitute for skilled professionals.

In doing so, take care not to injure your own hand.
