One who has great Virtue is like a new-born child.

Wasps, scorpions and cobra snakes will not bite him.
Fearsome beasts will not take him.
Raptors will not attack him.

His bones are soft, his muscles are weak, but his grip is firm.
He knows nothing of physical love and yet stands complete; his Essence is
strong.
He cries aloud all day without growing hoarse, because he is at Peace.

To always know Peace, to always be Open, is an Omen of Long Life.
The Heart that grows Angry becomes Strong.
Strong things only decline.

That is not the Way,
and what is not the Way will soon end.
