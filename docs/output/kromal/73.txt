Courage to act means death.
Courage not to act means life.
Of these two, one brings profit and one brings ruin, which Heaven loathes.

Who knows the reason why.

Heaven's Way is to succeed without struggle,
to respond without words,
to summon without commands.

Worship properly, but plan well.

Heaven's net is all-embracing.
Its mesh is wide, but overlooks nothing.
