The Ocean rules all Valleys because it lies below them,
and thus can be the King of all Valleys.

So the desire to be above the People requires speaking as if below them.
The desire to be before the People requires placing yourself behind.

Thus can the Wise Man be placed above, and the People are not burdened;
placed before, and the People are not harmed.

Thus does the world see Gladness, not Loathing.

He does not compete.
Therefore no one under Heaven competes against him.
