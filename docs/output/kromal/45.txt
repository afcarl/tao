Great Achievement appears deficient, but serves without fail.
Great Abundance seems modest, but provides without limit.

Great honesty appears devious.
Great intelligence seems dumb.
Great discussions are low-keyed.

Activity overcomes cold.
Stillness overcomes heat.

Peace and Quiet is proper under Heaven.
