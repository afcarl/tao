Heavy is the root of light.
Stillness is the master of impatience.

Thus the wise man travels all day, but does not leave his wagon.
Although there are glorious sights, he is relaxed and proper.

Why should the Lord of 10,000 chariots
conduct himself lightly under Heaven ?

Lightness leads to loss of roots.
Impatience leads to loss of control.
