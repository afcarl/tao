Yield to be Whole. Bend to be Straight.
Keep low to be Full. Wear out to Renew.
Having little allows gain. Having much causes confusion.

Thus does the wise man embrace the One, and is a model under Heaven.

Not self-centered, and therefore discerning.
Not self-absorbed, and therefore distinguished.
Not boastful, and therefore effective.
Not proud, and therefore fit for leadership.

Because he avoids disputes, he avoids worldly conflict.
Hence the old saying 'Yield to be whole'.

How else can Emptiness speak ?
Indeed, keep whole and complete.
