High Virtue is not Virtuous, and therefore has virtue.
Low Virtue is Virtuous, and thus lacks virtue.

High Virtue does not act, and governs by inaction.
Low Virtue acts, and governs by action.

Great Charity acts, but governs by inaction.
Great Justice acts, and governs by action.

Great Ritual takes action and gets no response,
then grabs you by the arm and expels you.

So, we lose the Way and turn to Virtue,
lack Virtue and look for Charity,
receive no Charity and seek Justice,
get no Justice and turn to Ritual.
Alas, Ritual is the shadow of true faith, and a source of confusion.

Divination is the flower of Tao, but the beginning of foolishness.
There do the Elders place their confidence, not with Ritual,
with the practical, not the imagined.

Therefore reject the latter, embrace the former.
