In governing men and serving Heaven, there is nothing like Economy.

Now, Economy means early preparation.
Early preparation means to value the accumulation of Virtue.

Value the accumulation of Virtue, and anything is possible.
When anything is possible, there are no limits.

When there are no limits, the Nation can be gained.
Gain the Mother of the Nation, and survival is assured.

This means deep roots, a solid foundation,
and a lifetime of following the Way.
