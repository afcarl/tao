The Military has a saying:
I dare not be the Master, but rather a Guest;
I dare not advance an inch, but will retreat a foot.

This means ...
proceed without acting,
repel without arms,
repulse without resistance,
maintain without troops.

There is no misfortune so great as Light Resistance.
Light Resistance may cost me my Treasures.

Therefore, avoid military buildup.
Grief is the only Victor.
