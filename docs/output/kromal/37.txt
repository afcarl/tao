Tao does nothing, and there is nothing it does not do.
If a Monarch can uphold it, all things will reform naturally.

As they reform, and desires arose,
I would calm them with Nameless Simplicity,
for Nameless Simplicity lessens desire.

Not desiring promotes Peace beneath Heaven,
and things beneath Heaven will stabilize.
