Nourish your Spirit; can you accept all things without distinction ?
Focus your energy; can you be pliant as a new-born babe ?

Dispel the darkness; can you observe without criticizing ?
Love the people; can you govern without Knowledge ?
Reach Heaven's gate; can you do it without gentleness ?
Understand the goal; can you succeed without action ?

Produce and save.
Create and do not possess.
Govern, and do not exploit.
Lead, and do not kill.

This is Mystic Virtue.
