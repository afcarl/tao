Life begets, Death receives.

The unborn are 3 in 10.
The dead are 3 in 10.
Mortal men active in life are also 3 in 10.

Now, what is the significance of the immortals?

There are stories about ones who survive.
They meet no tigers or rhinos on the road,
in war they go without armor.

Rhinos have nowhere to thrust their horns,
Tigers have nowhere to sink their claws,
Weapons have nowhere to pierce their blades.

So why are they untouched by Death ?
