Rule a great country as you would prepare delicacies.

Attain the Way under Heaven,
and its Demons will have no power.
Not that its Demons will have no power,
but rather their power will not harm men.
Not that their power will not harm men;
wise Men also will not harm men.

Neither will inflict harm.
Therefore Virtue will return.
