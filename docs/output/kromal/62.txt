The Way is the secret of all things.
Treasured by good men, it protects the bad.

Pleasing words may persuade.
Noble deeds can influence.
But of bad men, why abandon them ?

Therefore, at the coronation of the Son of Heaven,
at the installation of the three ministers,
although there be jade discs, followed by teams of horses,
nothing will compare to presenting this Tao.

Why has this Tao been treasured of old ?
Is it not said that to confess wrongdoing is to be forgiven ?
Therefore it is exalted under Heaven.
