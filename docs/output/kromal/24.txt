He who stands on tiptoe, does not stand firmly.
He who crosses over, does not proceed.

The self-centered are not discerning.
The self-absorbed are not distinguished.
The boaster is not effective.
The proud are not Leaders.

On the road, excess food means extra work.
Such things are undesirable, and the traveller avoids them.
