Be done with Knowledge and free of worry.

Is not 'Yes' the same as agreement ?
Do not Good and Evil occur together ?

People cannot control their fears,
and the foolishness is not yet over.

Most men are prosperous and happy.
They enjoy great strength, and climb the terraces in Spring.
I alone am silent, giving no sign,
as a new-born babe before its first breath;
exhausted beyond recovery.

Most men have energy to spare.
I alone seem lost, my foolish heart muddled.

Worldly men are clear and manifest;
I alone seem dim and confused.
Worldly men inquire and examine;
I alone am sad and depressed, indifferent as the ocean.
A constant wind has no equal.

Most men have ambition, while I alone am stubborn and provincial.
I alone am unusual among men, seeking the Mother's breast.
