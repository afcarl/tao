because their leaders consume too much in taxes;
that is why they are starving.

People are difficult to govern,
because of what their leaders do;
that is why they are difficult to govern.

People treat Death lightly,
because the demands of Life are so great;
that is why they treat Death lightly.

Meanwhile, those who do nothing to support themselves
are more esteemed than honorable lives.
