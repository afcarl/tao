Renounce experts, forsake wisdom,
and people gain a hundred fold.
Renounce charity, forsake justice,
and people return to filial compassion.
Renounce cleverness, forsake profit,
and thieves and robbers disappear.

These three can not be stressed enough.
Instead, there are regulations !

Dress plainly, live simply,
with few possessions and few needs.
