This desire to conquer the World and rule it, in my opinion, is futile.

The World is a spiritual entity, not able to be governed.
He who tries, fails. Even the most persistent do not succeed.

For some lead, and some follow.
Some sigh, and some bellow.
Some are strong, and some are weak.
Some rise, and some fall.

Thus does the wise man avoid extremes, avoid extravagance, avoid excess.
