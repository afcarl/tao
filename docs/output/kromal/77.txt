Heaven's Way is like bending a bow.
The High are lowered and the Low are raised.
The excess is diminished, and the deficiency is repaired.

Heavens way is to reduce the excess and repair the deficiency.

Man's way is not correct,
to decrease the deficient and increase the excessive.
Whoever can accumulate excess should offer it to the World.

This is the only Way.

Thus does the wise man govern and not exploit,
accomplish the results and not remain.

It is not his desire to be considered Wise.
