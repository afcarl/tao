What is well established is not uprooted.
What is well accepted is not cast off.
Thus will your children's children offer sacrifices forever.

Cultivated in the person, its virtue becomes genuine.
Cultivated in the home, its virtue multiplies.
Cultivated in the village, its virtue grows.
Cultivated in the nation, its virtue increases.
Cultivated in the world, its virtue becomes universal.

Thus does
a person judge a person,
a family judge a family,
a village judge a village,
a nation judge a nation,
a world judge a world.

How can I recognize an ideal world ?
By this.
