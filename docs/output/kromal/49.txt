The wise man has no opinions,
so that he may understand the opinions of others.

To the Good, I am Good.
To the not Good, I am also Good.
Virtue is Good.

To the Honest, I am Honest.
To the Dishonest, I am also Honest.
Virtue is Honest.

The wise man is at peace with the World,
and from the World conceals his thoughts.

The wise man is everyone's child.
