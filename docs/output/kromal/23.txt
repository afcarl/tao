Strive to express oneself correctly.
Just as a windstorm does not last all morning,
a sudden rain does not last all day.

What controls this is Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot make it last, so how can men ?
Therefore conduct affairs according to the Way.

The Taoist identifies with Tao.
The virtuous man identifies with Virtue.
The failure identifies with Loss.

Whoever identifies with Tao, must also love Tao.
Whoever identifies with Virtue, must also love Virtue.
Whoever identifies with Loss, must also love Loss.

The dishonest are not trusted.
