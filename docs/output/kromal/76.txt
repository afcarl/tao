At birth, a man is soft and weak.
At death, he is strong and powerful.

From grass to trees, all things begin life weak and frail.
At death, they are withered and dry.

Therefore, the Strong and Powerful are disciples of Death.
The Soft and Weak are disciples of Life.

Thus military strength does not ensure Victory.

A tree's strength is like the army;
the Big and Strong decline,
the Soft and Weak prevail.
