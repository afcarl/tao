What is to be closed, must first be opened.
What is to be weak, must first be strong.
What is to be poor, must first be rich.
What is to be taken, must first be given.

This is a subtle point.
The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.

Fish cannot leave the deep.
The nation's wealth cannot enlighten men.
