Now, a great army is not a measure of good fortune,
but rather a hateful thing, which a Taoist avoids.

It serves its Master only as an expensive aid.
Employ War only as a costly assistant.

War is not a measure of good fortune.
It is neither a measure of a Monarch's status, nor something he need employ.
Calm and mild is better.

Victory is not to be glorified, and whoever praises it is happy killing
people.
Alas, one who is happy killing people will not be remembered by the World.

Good Luck favors the left.
Bad Luck favors the right.
Stubbornly advancing troops serve the left.
Quickly advancing troops serve the right.

Speak of it as a sad ritual.
The slaughter of so many is a tragic sorrow.

Victory in battle is a sad ritual.
