At first,
those who knew the Way opposed enlightening people, considering it foolish.
People are more difficult to govern the more they know.

Thus a National government relying upon knowledge deceives the Nation.
When the National government does not rely upon knowledge, the Nation is
blessed.

Those who know these two also apply this standard.
To always know to apply this standard is called Mystic Virtue.
Mystic Virtue is deep and profound, a return to the Harmony of Things.

The greatest Concord was in the Past.
