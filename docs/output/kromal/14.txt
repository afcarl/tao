Look; not seeing, call it invisible.
Listen; not hearing, call it silent.
Touch; not feeling, call it intangible.
These three fail to provide answers,
and are therefore combined into one.

It is above, but not recognized.
It is below, but not hiding.

A guideline without name, it returns to Nothing.
Its appearance has no shape, Nothing is its form.
It seems an illusion.

Approaching, it has no head.
Withdrawing, it has no back.

It continues its ancient ways,
controls the present,
knows the Primal Beginning.

This is the Way of Time.
