Let emptiness prevail.
Maintain deep silence.

All things arise.
I can observe their return.
They flourish, then each returns to its center,
returns to its unchanging center.
This implies a return to life.
A return to life is the Norm.

To know the Norm leads to understanding.
To ignore the Norm is absurd, and leads to disaster.

To know the Norm is Tolerance.
Tolerance is Justice.
To be Just is to rule.
Sovereignty comes from Heaven.
Heaven is the Way.
The Way is eternal.

The disappearance of the body is not to be feared.
