Everyone under Heaven knows Beautiful;
this defines Beautiful as well as Ugly.
Everyone knows Good;
this defines Good as well as Bad.

Thus, Being and non-Being co-exist with each other,
Difficult and Easy complement each other,
Long and Short oppose each other,
High and Low merge with each other,
Sound and Noise blend with each other,
Front and Back relate to each other.

This is how the wise man can do without doing,
and teach without speaking.
All things are done without words.

Create and do not possess.
Govern and do not exploit.

Achieve the results and depart.
Depart to be remembered.
