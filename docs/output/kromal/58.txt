When Government is subdued, people are simple and honest.
When Government is obtrusive, people are lax and careless.

Disaster acts upon Blessings.
Blessings are subject to Disaster.
Who knows where it all ends ?

It's not right.
Proper becomes improper.
Good turns Evil.
People lose their bearings.

Thus is the wise man
critical but not harsh,
calm but not cutting,
firm but not reckless,
bright but not blinding.
