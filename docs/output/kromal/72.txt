When people do not respect authority, a greater authority appears.

Do not invade their homes.
Do not complicate their lives.
Only when they are not wearied, will they not be weary.

Thus is the Wise Man self-aware, but not self-absorbed;
self-confident, but not self-centered.

Therefore, give up the latter for the former.
