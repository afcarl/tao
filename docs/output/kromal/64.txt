What is calm is easy to manage.
What has not yet spread is easy to contain.
What is brittle is easy to break.
What is small is easy to scatter.

Control it before it happens.
Contain it before it spreads.

A great tree comes from fine pollen.
A multi-level terrace rises from repeated layers.
A thousand mile journey begins with a footstep.

To act is to fail.
To keep is to lose.

Thus does the wise man not act,
and therefore not fail;
not keep, and therefore not lose.

People look for trouble, and often fail on the brink of success.
Care in the end, as at the beginning, ensures success.
Is this not what the wise man wants,
rather than expensive, difficult to obtain goods ?

Know without Learning, to restore people to the way they were.
Help all things to correct themselves, but do not presume to act.
