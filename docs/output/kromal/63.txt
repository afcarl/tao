Govern without doing. Achieve without acting. Appreciate without
indulging.

Great or small, many or few,
repay Injustice with Virtue.

Plan for difficulty while it is easy.
Handle the big things while they are still small.

Under Heaven, difficult affairs always begin as easy ones.
Under Heaven, great events always arise from small ones.

Thus does the wise man, in the end, do nothing great,
because he already is able to achieve great results.

Remember that quick agreement deserves little trust,
for 'very easy' always turns into 'very difficult'.
Thus does the wise man treat things as difficult,
so that in the end, nothing is difficult.
