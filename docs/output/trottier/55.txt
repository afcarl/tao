One who is high in Virtue (Power)

is like the new-born babe.

Wasps and poisonous snakes don't sting,

Murderous beasts do not seize,

Birds who hunt do not beat,

Its bones are flexible, its muscles relaxed,

Its grip is strong.

It does not know the sex,

Growing in its wholeness,

and keeping its spirit

in its Life Force is at its greatest.

It screams

all day long

without getting hoarse,

Because of its perfect harmony.

To know harmony

is to know the Changeless.

To know the Changeless

is to have understanding.

To hurry the growth of life

is dangerous.

To control the breath by choice

is to over force it.

To be overgrown is to rot.

This is against Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ),

Whatever is

against Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )

soon ceases to be.
