Look at it

but you cannot see it!

Its name is Formless.

Listen to it

but you cannot hear it!

Its name is Soundless

. Try to hold it

but you cannot get it!

Its name is Incorporeal.

These three attributes

are to deep to measure;

They mix together

into one.

Its upper side is not bright:

Its under side is not dim.

Always the Not Namable

moves on,

Until it returns

beyond the world of things.

We call it

the formless Form,

the imageless Image.

We call it

the not describable

and unimaginable.

Confront it and

you do not see its face!

Follow it and

you do not see its back!

Yet equipped with this

timeless Tao (the Laws of the Universe),

You can control

present realities and deal with the past.

To know the ancient origins

( the beginning of the Universe ) is

to know the true Tao (the Laws of the Universe)
