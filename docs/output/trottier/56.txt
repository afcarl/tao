They who know may not speak.

They who speak may not know.

Block all the passage ways!

( Be content with your position. )

Shut all the doors!

( Remove all distractions. )

Unsharpen all edges!

( Be kind not sharp in your dealings with life. )

Untie all knots!

(Understand the the root of all problems.)

Blend all lights!

( View all you see based on the Laws of the Universe.)

Bring the world together

into one completeness!

( Understand the oneness of the World. )

This is called

the Beyond Understanding Completeness,

Which you cannot attract

or push away,

Benefit or hurt,

Honor or reduce.

It is the Highest Truth of the world.
