There are many things that have achieved Oneness.

The sky achieved Oneness and became clear;

The earth achieved Oneness and became calm;

The spirits achieved Oneness and became charged with powers;

The fountains achieved Oneness and became full;

All of the plants and animals achieved Oneness and became reproductive;

Leaders achieved Oneness and became the greatest rulers of the world.

All of them are what they are by virtue

( the power ) of Oneness.

If the sky were not clear, it would be likely to fall to pieces;

If the earth were not calm, it would be likely to burst into bits;

If the spirits were not charged with powers, they would be likely to cease
from being;

If the fountains were not full, they would be likely to dry up;

If all the plants and animals were not reproductive, they would be likely
to cease to exist;

If the leaders were not the greatest rulers, they would be likely to
stumble and fall.

Truly, humility is the root from which greatness springs,

The High must be built upon the foundation of the low.

That is why leaders describe themselves "The Helpless One," "The Little
One," and "The Worthless One."

To gain the peoples support.

They realize their

dependence upon the lowly.

Get honor

by not being honored.

It is not wise to

shine like jade and

sound like stone-chimes.

(The true leader

has substance

rather just appearance.)
