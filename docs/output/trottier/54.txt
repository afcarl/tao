What is well planted

cannot be uprooted.

What is well accepted

cannot slip away.

Your descendants

will pray for you

for ages without end.

Feed Virtue (Power)

in your own person,

And it becomes

a real part of you.

Feed Power in the family,

And it will stay.

Feed Power in the community,

And it will live and grow.

Feed Power in the state,

And it will be generously successful.

Feed Power in the World,

And it will become total.

A person must be judged as a person;

A family must be judged as family;

A community must be judged as a community;

A state must be judged as a state;

The world must be judged as a world.

How do I know about the world?

By what is within me.
