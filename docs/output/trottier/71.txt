To understand

that our knowledge

is not complete,

This

is a great

understanding.

To think

about our innocence

as knowledge,

This

is mental sickness.

Only when

we are sick

of our sickness

Shall we cease

to be sick.

The Complete Thinker

is not sick,

being sick of sickness;

This

is the secret

of health.
