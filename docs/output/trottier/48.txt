Rote Learning

involves daily

getting more;

The practice of Tao

(the Laws of the Universe)

involves daily

getting rid of.

Keep on

getting rid of and

getting rid of,

Until you reach

the state of Effortlessness.

Effortlessness and

nothing is

left undone.

To win the world,

give up all.

If you

still have

private goals,

You

will never

win

the world.
