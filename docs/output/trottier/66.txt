How does the sea become the King of all streams?

Because it lies lower than they!

That is why it is the king of all streams.

The Complete Thinker rules over the people by lowering themself in speech;

Leads the people by putting themself behind.

When a Complete Thinker stands above the people,

They do not feel the heaviness of weight;

When they stands in front of the people,

the people do not feel hurt.

All the world is glad to push them forward

without getting tired of them.

Because they compete with nobody,

Nobody can ever compete with them.
