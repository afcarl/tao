Good walking leaves

no track behind it,

but the walking was true;

Good speech leaves

no mark to be picked at,

but the speech was true;

Good calculation makes

no use of counting-slips,

yet the counting is true;

Good shutting makes

no use of bolt and bar,

And yet nobody can undo it;

Good tying makes

no use of rope and knot,

And yet nobody can untie it.

The Complete Thinker is

always good at saving humans,

And nobody is abandoned;

Always good at savings things,

And nothing is wasted.

This is called

"following the guidance of the Insight."

Good humans are the

teachers of destructive humans,

Destructive humans

depend on constructive humans.

Not to honor one's teacher,

Not to value one's dependent,

Is to be on the wrong road,

however intelligent one may be.

This is call the Important Not Obvious .
