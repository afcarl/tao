Does anyone want to take the world

and do what he wants with it?

I do not see how they can succeed.

The world

is a sacred vessel,

which must not be

tampered with

or grabbed after.

To tamper with it

is to spoil it,

and to grasp

is to lose it.

For all things

there is a time for going ahead,

and a time for following behind;

A time for slow-breathing

and a time for fast-breathing;

A time to grow in strength

and a time to decay;

time to be up

and a time to be down.

The Complete Thinker

avoids all extremes,

excesses

and luxuries.

Travels

the middle path.
