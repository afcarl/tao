Thirty Spokes

converge upon a single hub;

It is on

the hole in the center

that the use

of the cart hinges.

We make a bowl or cup

from a lump of clay;

It is the empty space

within the vessel

that makes it useful.

We make doors

and windows

for a room;

It is the

empty spaces

that make the

room livable.

Thus,

Take advantage of

what is visible,

By making use of

What is not visible.
