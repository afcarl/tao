Ah, for a small country

with a small population

! Though there are

very handy mechanical inventions,

the people

have no use for them.

Let them notice death

and not go to far away places.

Ships and tanks,

and weapons of war,

there may still be,

but there are no occasions

for using or displaying them.

Let the people go back to sending messages by knotting cords.

(Let nothing be urgent)

See to it that they are

happy with their food,

pleased with their clothing,

satisfied with their houses,

and use the simple ways of living.

Though there may be

another country so close

that they are in sight of each other

and the crowing of cocks

and barking of dogs

in one place

can be heard in the other,

yet there is no traffic

between them,

and throughout their lives

the two peoples

have nothing to do with each other.
