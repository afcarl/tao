The greatest perfection

is never completed,

So its use

never runs out.

The greatest fullness

has always room for more,

So its use

goes on forever.

The greatest straightness

is curved.

The greatest skill

is looks effortless.

The greatest speaking

is slow.

Moving around

overcomes cold,

Calm

overcomes heat.

The peaceful and

calm

Is the Normal

of the World.
