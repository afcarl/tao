By not making great the worthy

you will cause the people

to stop from having enemies and fighting.

(When everyone is equal, each is rewarded fairly.)

By not giving value to

goods hard to get,

you will cause the people

to stop from robbing and stealing.

(When material goods have no value there is no temptation to steal.)

By not showing

what people would like to have,

you will cause the people's hearts

to remain undisturbed.

(When people are not tempted to own things they do not desire things.)

Therefore, the Complete Thinker's way of governing begins by

Emptying the heart of wants,

Filling the belly with food,

Relaxing the ambitions, (not creating a temptation),

Toughening the bones, (guiding a healthful life).

In this way will cause

the people to remain

without strategy

and without desire,

and prevent the knowing ones

from causing any trouble.

Practice doing things at the Proper Speed, and everything

will be in order.
