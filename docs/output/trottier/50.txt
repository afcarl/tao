When one is out of Life,

one is in Death.

The partners of

Life are thirteen;

the partners of

Death are thirteen;

When a living person

moves into

the Realm of Death,

his partners are also thirteen.

How is this?

Because they draws upon

the property of

Life too heavily.

They who knows well how to live

meets no tigers

or wild buffaloes on their road,

comes out

from the battle-ground

not touched by the soldiers of war.

For, in them,

a buffalo would

find no target for his horns,

a tiger

nothing to put

his claws upon,

and a soldier of war

no place for its tool to enter.

How is this?

Because there is

no room for Death

in them.
