In times past

the Complete Thinkers of the Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

were not obvious

about what they did and

could change to

meet the circumstance,

Their minds,

strong and

widespread,

were too deep to be measured.

Because their minds

are unmeasurable,

One can only describe them

unclearly by their appearance.

Slow to start

like one crossing thin ice;

Shy as if surrounded by danger

on all sides;

Careful and polite like a guest;

Unbouded like ice on the point of melting;

Genuine like an

uncarved block;

Hollow like

a cave;

Disordered like

a muddy pool;

And yet who else could

quietly and gradually

change from the muddy to the clear?

Who else could

slowly but steadily

move from the lifeless to the living?

The who keep the Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

does not want to be full.

But precisely because they are never full,

They can always

remain open in thought,

They do not become rigid in thought.
