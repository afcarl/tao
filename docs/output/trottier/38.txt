High Virtue (Power) is completely virtuous (powerful) without chasing after
virtue (power);

Therefore it has Virtue (Power).

Low Virtue (Power) is always chasing after virtue (power)

and never frees itself from the chase;

Therefore it is without Virtue (Power).

High Virtue (Power) is without problems and is without private goals to
serve:

Low Virtue (Power) not only makes problems but has private goals to serve.

High humanity makes problems but is without private goals to serve:

High morality not only makes problems but has private goals to serve.

High ceremony makes problems but is without response;

Then it raises its arms to show itself.

Losing Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ), man uses Virtue (Power).

Losing Virtue (Power), humans use humanity.

Losing humanity, people use morality.

Losing morality, humans use ceremony.

Ceremony is the shell of faith and loyalty;

It is the beginning of all,

not understanding and mix-up.

Knowing the future, is only, the

attractive without substance part, of the Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ),

And the beginning of foolishness.

The full-grown human

Can enter the substance

rather than the shell;

Can enter totality

rather than the promise.

They prefer what is within

instead of appearance.
