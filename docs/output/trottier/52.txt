All-under Heaven

have a common Beginning

This Beginning is

the Mother of the world.

Having known the Mother,

We may proceed to know her children.

Having known the children,

We should go back and hold on to the Mother

In so doing, you will take no risk

Even though your body be destroyed.

Block all the passage ways!

Shut all the doors!

And to the end of your days

you will not be worn out.

Open the passages!

Multiply your activities!

And to the end of your days you will remain helpless.

To see the small is

to have insight.

To hold on to flexibility is

to be strong.

If, in using your factual intelligence

You return to your insight.

You will not bring destruction

upon yourself.

This is the way of learning the Changeless.
