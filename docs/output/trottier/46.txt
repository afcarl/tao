When the world is

in possession of

the Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ),

The galloping horses

are led to fertilize

the fields

with their droppings.

( People create goods for exchange and

contend with each other in sport.)

When the world

has become

Taoless ( without the Laws of the Universe ),

War horses

breed themselves in the suburbs.

(People create tools of destruction and

contend with each other over the ownership of countries.)

There is no disaster

like not knowing

what is enough.

There is no evil

like greed.

They

who know

what

is enough

will

always

have enough.
