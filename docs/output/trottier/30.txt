Who knows how to guide a leader in the path of Tao (the Laws of the Universe),

Does not try to conquer the world

with military force.

It is in the nature of a military force to turn against its user.

(Economic Force stregthens the Society)

Wherever armies are stationed,

thorny bushes grow.

After a great war,

bad years always follow.

(Over spending for military might only overtaxes the people)

Protect efficiently your own state,

But not to aim at selfishness.

After you have attained your purpose,

You must not show off your success,

You must not brag of your ability,

You must not feel proud,

You must rather regret that you had not been able to prevent the war.

You must never think of taking control of others by force.

To be over-developed is to quicken decay,

And this is against Tao (the Laws of the Universe),

And what is against Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

will soon end.
