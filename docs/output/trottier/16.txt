Achieve the utmost Emptiness.

Cling single-heartedly to

interior peace.

Become a part

of all things,

In this way

see the pattern.

Flourish they do,

Each of them will

return to its root.

To return to

the root is

to find peace.

To find peace is

to fulfill one's destiny.

To fulfill one's destiny is

to be unchanging.

To know the Unchanging is

called Insight.

If one does not

know the Unchanging,

One runs blindly

into disasters.

If one knows

the Unchanging,

One can understand and

embrace all.

If one understands and

embraces all,

One is capable of

doing justice.

To be just is

to be a leader;

To be a leader is

to be one with nature;

To be one with nature is

to be one with the Tao (the Laws of the Universe);

To be one with

the Tao (the Laws of the Universe) is to become immortal.

Such a one will be safe and whole,

Even after the death of body.

The Tao does not decay.
