The Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )

is the hidden Source

of all things.

A treasure

to the honest,

it is a protection

to the confused.

A good word

will find its own location.

A good deed

may be used as a gift to another.

A person

missing the right path

Is no reason

they should be thrown away.

At the official times of empowerment,

Let others offer their discs of jade, following it up with cars and boats;

It is better for you to offer

the Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )

without moving your feet!

Why did the people of the past prize

the Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )?

It is because

by the virtue (the power) of it,

he who looks finds,

And the guilty are forgiven.

That is why

it is such a treasure

to the world.
