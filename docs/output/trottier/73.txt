The man who is brave

and takes unneeded chances

will be killed;

The man who is brave

and does not take unneeded chances will survive.

Of these two kinds of bravery,

one proves harmful,

while the other is helpful.

Some things

are hated by the Laws of the Universe,

But who knows the reason?

Even the Complete Thinker

does not understand

such a question.

It is the Universal Law,

to win without effort.

It is the Universal Law

to get answers without speaking.

It is the Universal Law

To get the people to come

without calling them.

It is the Universal Law

To act agreeing to plans without hurry.

Powerful, beyond knowing are the Laws of the Universe:

Visible only by its results

and yet

Only the formless

can create new results.
