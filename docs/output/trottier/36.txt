What is in the end

to be shrunken,

Begins by being first

stretched out.

What is in the end

to be weakened,

Begins by being first

made strong.

What is in the end

to be thrown down,

Begins by being first

set on high.

What is in the end

to be raped,

Begins by being first

given riches.

Herein is the hidden

wisdom of life:

The soft and

weak

overcomes the

hard and strong.

Just as the fish

must not leave

the deeps,

The words of agression

should not be used.
