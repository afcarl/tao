The planners of fights

have a saying:

I do not want to receive guests,

but I would like to be a guest;

I do not want to go forward an inch,

but I would like to go back a foot.

This is called marching without moving,

Rolling up one's sleeves without baring one's arms,

Capturing the enemy without facing them,

Holding a weapon that is invisible.

There is no greater disaster

than to under-estimate

the strength of your enemy.

For to under-estimate the strength

of your enemy

is to lose your treasure.

When disagreeing armies

meet in battle,

victory belongs to

the sorrowing side.
