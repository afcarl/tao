Where the leader is quiet, quiet,

The people are simple and happy.

Where the leader is dishonest, dishonest,

The people are tricky and unhappy.

Bad fortune is what

good fortune leans on,

Good fortune is what

bad fortune hides in.

Who knows the final end of this process?

Is there not a normal of right?

What is normal, soon

becomes not normal,

And what is good soon

turns bad.

Long indeed have the

people been in difficulty.

The Complete Thinker:

makes even without cutting,

Is honest without hurting,

Is direct without effort,

Teaches without causing the mind to be excited.
