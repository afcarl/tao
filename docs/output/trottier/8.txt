The highest form of

goodness is like water.

Water knows how to

benefit all things

without contention.

It flows to places

others disdain.

It comes near the Tao (the Laws of the Universe).

In choosing your dwelling,

know how to keep the ground.

In cultivating your mind,

know how to dive

in the hidden depths.

In dealing with others,

know how to be

gentle and kind.

Speak within

trust.

In governing,

know how to

maintain order.

In transacting business,

know how to

be efficient.

In making a move,

know how to

choose the right moment.

If you

do not contend,

none contend

against you.
