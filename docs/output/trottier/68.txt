A good soldier

is never the first to fight;

A good fighter

is never angry.

The best way

of beating an enemy

Is to win them over

by not disagreeing with them.

The best way

of employing a person

Is to serve under them.

This is called

the virtue (power) of non-striving!

This is called

using the abilities of people!

This is called

being wedded to Heaven like in the past!
