Know the masculine,

Keep to the feminine,

And be the

Brook of the World.

To be the Brook of the World is

To move unchanging

in the path of Power

Without swerving from it,

And to return again to infancy.

Know the white,

Keep to the black,

And be the Pattern of the World.

To be the Pattern of the World is

To move unchanging in the path of Power

Without making a single wrong step, And to return again to the Infinite.

Know the glorious,

Keep to the lowly,

And be the Fountain of

the World.

To be the Fountain of

the World is

To live the

life of Virute (Power) ,

And to return again to

the First Simplicity.

When the First Simplicity

splits apart,

It becomes useful tools,

Then in the hands

of a Complete Thinker,

make them leaders.
