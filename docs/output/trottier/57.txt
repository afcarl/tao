You lead a group with correctness;

You fight a war by moves not thought of by your enemies;

You win the world by not using effort.

How do I know this is so?

By what is within me!

The more things that are forbidden

and limited in the world,

The poorer the people become.

(Freedom for the people is required for a full life.)

The more destructive the weapons

the people possess,

The greater confusion controls the land.

(People are dangerous to other people and the greater the tools of
destruction in their hands the more they will destroy.)

The more clever and tricky the men,

The more often strange things happen.

(People who cheat the Laws of the Universe cause a lack of balance which
can not last.)

The more well spoken the laws and rulings,

The more robbers and thieves there are.

(The more rules there are, the more likely people will break them in the
course of life.

Then after breaking some rules the other rules are less respected and
criminals are considered normal citizens.)

The Complete Thinker says:

I live a simple life,

and the people change themselves.

I love quiet,

and the people settle down in their regular jobs.

I look to effortlessness,

and the people grow rich.

I have no desires,

and the people return to Simplicity.
