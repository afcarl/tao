Honest words

are not sweet,

Sweet words

are not honest.

Good people

are not bad-tempered,

The bad-tempered

are not good.

The wise

do not think of themselves

as knowing more than others,

the ones

who think of themselves

as knowing more than others

are not wise.

The Complete Thinker

does not collect riches.

The more they lives for others,

The fuller is their life.

The more they give,

the more they win.

The Laws of the Universe (Tao)

are to help,

not to hurt.

The Way of the Complete Thinker

is to do their duty,

not to compete

with anyone.
