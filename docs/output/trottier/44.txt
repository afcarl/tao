Your name and

your body,

which is more valuable?

Your body and

your wealth,

which is more prized?

Gain and

loss,

which is more painful?

Too much

love for anything

will cost you

a lot in the end.

The storing up of

too much worldly goods

will mean

a big loss.

Know when

you have enough and

be immune

from disgrace.

Know when

to stop and

be protected

from dangers.

Only this way

can you

last long.
