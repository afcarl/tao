Maybe

the Laws of the Universe (Tao)

may be compared

to the

stretching

of a bow!

The upper part is depressed,

while the lower is raised.

If the bow-string is too long,

it is cut short:

if too short,

it is added to.

The Laws of the Universe (Tao)

makes smaller

the more-than-enough

to supply

the less than enough.

The way of people

is different:

it takes

from the poor

to give

the rich.

Who except

a person of the Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ) can put

their never ending riches

to the service of the world?

The Complete Thinker

does work

without setting any store by it,

accomplishes tasks

without dwelling upon them.

They do not want their merits to be seen.
