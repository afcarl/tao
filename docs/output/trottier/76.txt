When a person is living

they are soft and easy to bend.

When they are dead,

they become hard and stiff.

When a plant is living,

it is soft and tender.

When it is dead,

it becomes withered and dry.

The hard and stiff

belongs to the company

of the dead:

The soft and easy to bend

belongs to the company

of the living.

A mighty army

can to fall

by its own weight,

Just as dry wood

is ready

for the ax.

The mighty

and great

will be put low;

The humble

and weak

will be raised high.
