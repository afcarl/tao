In the old days,

those who were good at the practice of Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )

did not try to teach the people,

but to keep them in the state of simple life.

Why are the people hard to govern?

Because they are too tricky!

They who govern their state

with trickiness is its wrongdoer;

They who govern their state without resorting to trickiness is its
protector.

To know these principles is to have a rule and a measure.

To keep the rule and the measure constantly in your mind

is what we call

Virtue (Power) that is hidden!

It leads all things to return,

till they come back to the Great Balance!
