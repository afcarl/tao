Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )

gave birth to One,

( The Unified Field )

One gave birth to Two,

( Energy and Matter, E=MC2 )

Two gave birth to Three,

( Gravity, Nuclear and Electro-Magnetic Forces)

Three gave birth to all things.

All the things carry the

Yin (physical(matter)) on their backs and

hold the

Yang (spiritual(energy)) to their chest,

Getting their vital balance from the

proper blending of the two vital Breaths.

(Physical(matter) and Spiritual(energy))

What is more hated by men than to be "helpless( in need of help),"

"little( no desire to be superior )," and

"worthless ( no desire to be rich )"?

These are the very names the

true leaders call themselves.

You can gain by losing (putting ourselves in a position to gain),

And you can lose by gaining (receiving our hearts desire and feeling lost
).

What others have taught I repeat:

"A person who lives for destruction will attract destruction to themself."

(Destruction attracts destruction.

Construction attracts construction.

Weakness attracts destruction.

Virtue (power) attracts construction.)

I will make this chapter my most important teaching.
