Accept and you will be whole.

Bend and you will straighten.

Empty and you will fill.

Grow old and you will be renewed.

Have little and you will gain.

Have much and you will be confused.

The Complete Thinker

embraces the One,

Becomes a Pattern to

all under Heaven.

Does not make a show,

Then shines;

Does not justify self,

Then becomes known;

Does not brag of ability,

Then gets credit;

Does not show success,

Then lasts;

Does not compete with anyone,

Then no one can compete with the Complete Thinker.

Indeed, the ancient saying:

"Accept and you will remain whole"

is no idle word.

Once whole,

Turn within and concentrate your Power.

The world is as your home.
