Heaven-and-Earth is

not sentimental;

It treats all things

like straw dogs

(equal).

The Complete Thinker is

not sentimental;

Treats all people

as straw dogs

( equally).

Between Heaven and Earth,

There seems to be

a Bellows:

It is empty,

yet it can

not be emptied;

The more it works,

the more comes

out of it.

The Complete Thinker

draws upon the universal experience

thus cannot be exhausted.

Better look for it

within you.

The Tao (the Laws of the Universe) is

in all that exists.
