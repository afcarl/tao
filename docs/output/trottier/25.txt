There was Something undefined and complete in itself,

Born before Heaven-and-Earth.

Silent and

endless,

Standing alone

without change,

Being within all,

It may be thought of as

the Mother of the world.

I do not know its name;

I write it

"Tao (the Laws of the Universe)";

Without a better word,

call it

"The Great."

To be great is

to go on,

To go on is

to go far,

To go far is

to return.

Therefore,

"Tao (the Laws of the Universe) is great,

Heaven is great,

Earth is great,

The Leader is great"

Thus the Leader is

one of the great four in the Universe.

Humans follows

the ways of the Earth.

Earth follows

the ways of Heaven,

Heaven follows

the ways of Tao (the Laws of the Universe),

Tao (the Laws of the Universe) follows

its own ways.
