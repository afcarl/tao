When people

no longer fear

your power,

It is a sign

that a greater power

is coming.

Interfere not lightly

with a persons house,

(Do not intrude on their privacy.)

Do not make heavy taxes upon their work.

Only when you stop tiring them,

Will they stop being tired of you.

The Complete Thinker

knows self,

But makes

no show of self;

Loves self,

But does not

lift self

above others.

They prefer

what is within

to what

is without.
