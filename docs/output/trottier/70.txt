My words

are very easy

to understand,

and very easy

to practice:

But the civilization today

cannot understand them,

nor practice them

My words have an Ancestor.

My deeds have a Lord.

The people

have no knowledge

of this.

They

have no knowledge

of me.

The fewer persons

know me,

The greater they are

that follow me.

The Complete Thinker

looks like the common man,

While keeping

the Laws of the Universe

and the Power of their application

in his heart.
