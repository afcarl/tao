TAO ( THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE )

gives them life,

Virtue (Power)

nurses them,

Matter

shapes them,

Environment

completes them.

All things worship Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )

and pray to Virtue (Power).

They have not been commanded to worship Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )
and pray to Virtue (Power),

But they always do so automatically.

It is Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )

that gives them life:

Its Virtue (Power)

that nurses them,

grows them,

raises them,

shelters them,

comforts them,

feeds them

and covers them under her wings.

To give life but to demand nothing,

To do your work

but to set no importance to it,

To be a leader,

not a rule maker,

This is called

Hidden Virtue (Power).
