The Tao (the Law of the Universe) is like

an empty bowl.

Which in being used

can never be filled up

. So deep it

cannot be measured,

it is the

origin of all things.

It blurs

all sharp edges,

It unties

all tangles,

It blends

all lights,

It unites the world

into one whole.

Hidden

in the depths,

Yet it seems to

exist for ever.

I do not know

whose child it is;

It is the common ancestor

of all,

the father of all things.

(It is the Universal Laws from the beginning of our Universe),

To live by these Laws is to

live in harmony with our

True Nature.
