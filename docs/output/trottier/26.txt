Heaviness is

the root of lightness.

Peace of mind is

the master of restlessness.

The Complete Thinker,

traveling all day,

Does not leave

the baggage-wagon;

There may be

gorgeous sights to see,

But stays

peacefully at home.

How can a leader

Have a light hearted position in the world?

To be light hearted

is to be separated from one's root;

To be restless

is to lose one's self-mastery.
