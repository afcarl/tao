The Great Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

is universal like a flood.

How can it be turned

to the right

or to the left?

All creatures depend on it,

and it denies nothing to anyone.

It does its work,

But it makes no claims for itself.

It clothes and feeds all,

But it does not rule them

: Thus, it may be called

"the Little."

All things return to it

as to their home,

But it does not rule them:

It may be called

"the Great."

It is just because it

does not wish to be great

That its greatness

is fully realized.

The Complete Thinker

would not control the world;

They are in harmony

with the world.
