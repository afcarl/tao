When a great wound

is healed,

There will still

remain a scar.

Can this be

a desirable thing?

The Complete Thinker,

holding the left-hand tally

( the count of things to come),

Performs

their part

of the agreement,

But puts

no demands

on others.

The virtuous (powerful)

do their work;

The virtue-less (powerless)

knows only to put

taxes on the people.

The Laws of the Universe (Tao)

have no private feelings,

But

always agrees

with the constructive.
