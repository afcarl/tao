When a wise scholar hears the Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ),

They practice it without fail.

When a average scholar hears the

Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ),

They move between belief and unbelief.

When a worthless scholar hears the

Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ),

They laugh loudly at it.

If such a one does not laugh at it,

The Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ) would not be the Tao ( the Laws of the
Universe )!

To the untrained observer;

Who understands the Tao, seems foolish;

Who progresses in the Tao, seems to fail;

Who follows the Tao, seems to wander.

The wise people of old have truly said:

The bright Way looks dim.

The forward Way looks backward.

The smooth Way looks rough.

High Virtue (Power) looks low like a bottomless pit.

Great clearness looks spotted.

Unending Virtue (Power) looks like it is not enough.

Proved Virtue (Power) looks pitiful.

Solid Virtue (Power) looks as though melted.

Greatest space has no corners.

Great talents are slowly mastered.

Great music has the rarest sound.

Great Form is shapeless.

The Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ) is hidden and nameless;

It alone knows how to give help and to make whole.
