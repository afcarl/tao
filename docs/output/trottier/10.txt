In keeping the spirit

and the vital soul

together,

Are you able to

maintain their perfect blending?

Breath gently

and become newborn.

Clear your inner vision,

and become clear.

In loving your people and

governing your state,

Are you able to

be impartial?

In opening and shutting

of heaven's gate(your heart),

you become

accepted.

Enlightened and

seeing

far into all directions,

Can you at the same time

remain not involved and

not interfere?

Raise your people with care!

Feed your people!

Raise them without saying

they are your own!

Do your work

without setting

any value to it!

Be one to be followed,

not one who commands!

This is called Hidden Powers.

This is true harmony.
