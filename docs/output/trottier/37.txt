Tao (the Laws of the Universe) never makes

any showiness,

And yet it

does everything.

If a ruler can

stick to it,

All things will

grow of themselves.

When they have

grown and

tend to make an excitement,

It is time to keep them

in their place

by the aid of

the nameless First Simplicity.

Which alone can

control the desires

of people.

When the desires

of people

are limited,

there will be peace,

And the world

will settle down

of its own agreement.
