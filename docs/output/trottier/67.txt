All the world says that

my Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ) is great,

but seems strange, like nothing on earth.

But it is just because my Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ) is great that it
is like nothing on earth!

If it were like anything on earth,

how small it would have been from the very beginning!

I have Three Treasures,

Which I hold fast and watch over closely.

The first is Mercy.

The second is Frugality.

The third is Daring to Be Not First in the World.

Because I am merciful,

I can be brave.

Because I am frugal,

I can be generous.

Because I dare not to be first,

I can lead.

If a person wants to be brave

without first being merciful,

generous without first being frugal,

a leader without first wishing to follow,

they are only asking for destruction!

Mercy alone

can help you win a war.

Mercy alone

can help you defend your state.

Heaven will come

to the rescue of the merciful,

and protect them with its Mercy.
