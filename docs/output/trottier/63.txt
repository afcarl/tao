Do the Effortlessness.

Try for the effortless.

Enjoy the joyless.

Raise high the low.

Multiply the few.

Return hurt with kindness.

Stop troubles in the beginning.

Plant the great with the small.

Difficult things of the world.

Can only be tackled when they are easy.

Big things of the world

Can only be completed by paying attention to their small beginnings.

The Complete Thinker never has to struggle with the big things,

But they alone are capable of completing them!

They who promises lightly must be lacking in faith.

They who thinks everything easy

will end by finding difficulty.

The Complete Thinker,

who regards everything as difficult,

Meets with no difficulties in the end.
