The Complete Thinker

has no interests

of their own,

But takes

the interests

of the people

as their own.

They are kind

to the kind;

They are also kind

to the not kind:

Kindness is Power.

They are faithful

to the faithful

They are also faithful

to the not faithful:

Faithfulness is Power.

In the middle of the world,

the Complete Thinker

is shy and

does not brag.

For the world

they keep their heart

in its largest state.

All the people

try to listen and see:

The Complete Thinker

acts without prejudice.
