Soldiers of war predict destruction.

And are for use against Life.

A person of Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

does not set his heart upon them.( A person of Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

does not build armies to fight and take control of others land.)

In ordinary life, a gentle person regards

the left side (omen of the future) as the place of honor:

In war, the right side (omen of the past) is the place of honor.

As soldiers are tools of destruction, They are not properly

a gentle person's tools;

On necessity will they will use them,

(having them and knowing their use).

With calm control.

Even winning is

no cause for rejoicing.

To rejoice over a war won is

to rejoice over the slaughter of humans!

So a person who rejoices

over the slaughter of humans

cannot expect to do well

in the world of humans.

On happy occasions the left side (omen of the future) is preferred:

On sad occasions the right side (omen of the past) .

In the army, the Lieutenant Commander stands on the left,

While the Commander-in-Chief stands on the right.

This means that war is treated as equal to a funeral service (rememberance of the past).

Because many people have been killed,

it is only correct that living should be sad at the loss of them.

Hence, even in a victory is a funeral.
