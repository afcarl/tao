When all the world recognizes beauty as beauty,

this in itself is ugliness,

(for it lacks a seeing of the Truth.)

(When all of humankind abstracts beauty there is no beauty).

When all the world recognizes good as good, this in itself is

destruction.,

(for it lacks a seeing of the Truth.)

(What is good in one circumstance is bad in another).

Indeed, the hidden and the visible give birth to each other.

Hard and easy balance each other.

Long and short give measure to each other.

High and low set measure to each other.

Voice and sound give wholeness each other.

Back and front follow each other.

Therefore, the Complete Thinker

experiences without abstraction

and accomplishes without visible action;

Yet spreads their teaching by actions.

Accepting the ebb and flow of

the many living things.

Raises them,

but makes no claim of them.

Does his work,

but does not brag about it.

Finishing tasks,

and moves on.

And yet it is just because

of moving on.

That nobody can take

works away.
