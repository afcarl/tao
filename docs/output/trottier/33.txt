Who knows people is clever;

Who knows self has enlightenment.

Who conquers a people has force;

Who conquers self is truly strong.

Who knows when they have enough are rich,

And who follows carefully

the path of Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

is a person of steady purpose.

Who stays

where they have found their true home

lasts long,

And who dies but is not forgotten enjoys real longevity.
