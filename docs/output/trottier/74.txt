When the people

are no longer afraid

of death,

Why scare them

with the spirit

of death?

If you

could make the people

always afraid

of death,

And they still

break the law,

Then you

might arrest

and execute them,

And who

would dare

break the law?

Is not

the Great Executioner

always there to kill?

To do

the killing

for the Great Executioner

Is to chop wood

for a master carpenter,

And you would be lucky indeed

if you

did not

hurt your own hand!
