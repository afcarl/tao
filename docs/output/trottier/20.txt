Have done with rote learning,

And you will have no more frustration.

How great is the difference between agreement and being the servant?

What is the difference between "construction" and "destruction"?

Must I fear what others fear?

What difficult stupidity this is

! All are joyous and beaming,

As though feasting upon a sacrificial ox, As though mounting the Spring Garden;

I alone am peaceful and give no sign, Like a babe which has not yet smiled.

I alone am forgotten as one who has no home to return to.

All have enough and more:

I alone appear to possess nothing.

What a not knowing person I am!

What a confused mind I have!

All are bright,

bright:

I alone am dim,

dim.

All are sharp,

sharp:

I alone am silent, silent!

Tasteless like the ocean,

Aimless like the drifting wind.

All settle in their paths:

I alone am stubborn and remain outside.

I am most different from others

In knowing

to take support from

my Eternal Mother!
