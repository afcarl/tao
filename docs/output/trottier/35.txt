Who holds to the Great Pattern

will attract all things to them.

They go to them and

receive no harm,

in them they find

peace,

security and

happiness.

Music and

snacks can only

make a passing guest pause.

The words of Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

have lasting effects,

They are mild and

flavorless,

We look and see nothing.

We listen and hear nothing.

But if we use it,

It is without end.
