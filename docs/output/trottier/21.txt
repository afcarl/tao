It lies in the nature of

Power

To follow the Tao (the Laws of the Universe) and

the Tao (the Laws of the Universe) alone.

Now what is the Tao (the Laws of the Universe)?

It is Something slippery and shifty. Shifty and slippery!

And yet It contains within Itself a Form. Shifty and slippery!

And yet It contains within Itself a Substance.

Shadowy and dim!

And yet It contains within Itself a Core of Energy ( the Force of Life ).

The Core of Energy ( Force of Life ) is very real,

It contains within Itself an unfailing Honesty.

Throughout the ages

Its Name has been preserved

In order to recall the

Beginning of all things.

(We can see and hear the background radiation that was the Big Bang the beginning of

our Universe.)

How do I know the ways of all things at the Beginning?

By what is within me.

(For are we not made of recycled Star Stuff.)
