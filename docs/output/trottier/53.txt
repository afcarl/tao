If I had the smallest seed of wisdom,

I would walk the Great Way,

And my only fear

would be to lose my way from it.

The Great Way is very smooth and straight;

And yet the people like better the complicated paths.

The courtyard is very clean and well decorated,

( Their cities appear powerful. )

But the fields are very weedy and wild,

And the grain silo's are very empty!

( But they have lost the skill to feed themselves. )

They wear beautiful clothes,

( They value appearances over substance.)

They carry destructive weapons,

( They use the tools of destruction to get their needs. )

They over fill themselves with food and drink,

( They indulge themselves in the fruits of the conquered. )

They own more riches than they can use!

( They are greedy. )

They are the messengers of lawlessness!

As for Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ),

what do they know about it?
