Nothing in the world

is softer and weaker

than water;

But,

for attacking

the hard and strong,

there is nothing like it!

For nothing

can take its place.

That the weak

overcomes the strong,

and the soft

overcomes the hard,

This is something

known by all,

but practiced

by none.

The Complete Thinker says:

To receive

the dirt of a country

is to be

the lord of its soil-shrines.

to hold up under

the disasters of a country

is to be

the prince of the world.

( To be strong in the face of discrace and disaster, is to be truly Noble.)

Indeed,

the Truth

sound like its opposite!
