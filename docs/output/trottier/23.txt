Only simple and

quiet words will

ripen of themselves.

For a whirlwind

does not last a

whole morning.

A sudden rain

does not last

a whole day.

Who is their creator?

Heaven-and-Earth!

Even Heaven-and-Earth

cannot make such

violent things

last long;

The same is true of the

reckless efforts of humans.

Who helps the Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

is one with the Tao (the Laws of the Universe);

Who thinks with Power

is one with Power;

And who seeks the hand of loss

is one with Loss.

To be one with

the Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

is to be a welcome addition to

the Tao (the Laws of the Universe);

To be one with Power

is to be a welcome addition

to Power;

To be one with Loss

is to be a welcome addition

to Loss.

Failure of faith

on your part

Creates faithlessness

on the part of others.
