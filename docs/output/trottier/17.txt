The best type of leader

is one of whose existence

the people are barely aware.

Next comes one

whom they love and praise.

Next comes one

whom they fear.

Next comes one

whom they despise and defy.

When you are

lacking in faith,

Others will be

unfaithful to you.

The Complete Thinker is

quiet and uses few words.

When tasks have been

accomplished and

things have been completed,

All the people say,

"We ourselves have achieved it!"
