Ruling a big kingdom

is like cooking

a small fish.

( You have to be

careful not to burn it.)

When a person of

Tao ( the Laws of the Universe )

rules over the world,

demons have

no spiritual powers.

Not that the demons

have no spiritual powers,

but the spirits themselves

do no harm to humans.

Not that the spirits

do no harm to humans,

but the Complete Thinker

does no harm to the people.

If only

the leader and

people

would stop

from hurting

each other,

all the good things

of life

would

get together

in the kingdom.
