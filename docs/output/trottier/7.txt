Heaven lasts long, and

Earth lasts.

What is the secret of

their lasting?

Is it not because

they do not live for themselves

That they can

live so long?

The Complete Thinker wants to

remain behind,

But is found at

the head of others;

Ignores his desires,

But is found

content.

Is it not because

of selflessness

That True Self is realized?
