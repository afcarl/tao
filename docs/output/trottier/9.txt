Fill a cup

to its brim,

it is easy

to spill.

Do not

over do the task,

close it.

Temper a sword throughout

to its hardest,

and it is easily broken.

Fill your house

with gold and

jade,

it can not

be guarded.

(Do not tempt

others for

someone will

give in to temptation.)

Set store

by your riches and

honor,

you easily fall.

This is the Tao

(the Laws of the Universe):

When your purpose is achieved retire.
