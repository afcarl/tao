Without

going out of

your door,

You

can know

the ways

of the world.

Without

looking through

your window,

You

can see

the Tao

(the Laws of the Universe).

You can travel far,

And know very little.

The Complete Thinker

knows

without traveling,

Sees

without looking,

And achieves

without Effort.

(Because they understand

the Laws of the Universe and

the Power of their application.)
