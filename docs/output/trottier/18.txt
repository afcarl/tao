When the Great Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

was abandoned,

There appeared

duty and justice.

When intelligence

and jokes arose,

There appeared people

who said they were one way but lived the opposite.

When the family

lost their compatibility,

There appeared respectful devotion

and fatherly kindness.

When darkness and disorder

began to control a country,

There appeared

the loyal and trustworthy patriots.
