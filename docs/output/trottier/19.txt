Drop wisdom,

abandon cleverness,

And the people will be

benefited a hundred fold.

Drop humanity,

abandon morality,

And the people will

return to their natural affections.

Drop cleverness,

abandon greed,

And robbers and thieves

will cease to be.

These three are a

pattern of Tao (the Laws of the Universe),

And are not sufficient in themselves

they are only symptoms.

They should be subordinated

to a Higher principle;

People need

personal remedies.

See the simple True Self

and embrace

your original nature.

Forget you habits and desires,

simplify you life.
