The Spirit of

the Valley dies not.

It is called

the Secret

which is Filled with

womanly qualities.

The Gateway of the

Secret is

Filled with womanly qualities

Is called

the Womb of Heaven-and-Earth.

Staying like

a fog,

it has only a

hint that it is there;

And yet when you

use it,

it is always there

without end.
