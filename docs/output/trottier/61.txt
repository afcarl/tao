A great Country

is like the lowland

to which all streams flow.

It is the lake

of all under heaven,

the Feminine of the world.

The Feminine

always conquers

the Masculine

by her quietness,

by lowering herself

through her quietness.

If a great country

can lower itself

before a small country,

it will win over

the small country;

and if a small country

can lower itself

before a great country,

it will win over

the great country.

The one wins

by lowering itself;

the other,

by remaining low.

What a great country wants

is simply

to accept more people;

and what a small country wants

is simply

to serve its protector.

Each gets what it wants.

But it benefits

a great country

to lower itself.
