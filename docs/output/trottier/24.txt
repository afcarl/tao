One on tip-toe

cannot stand solid.

Sitting on a horse

you cannot walk.

Who shows off

does not shine

. Who brags

has no glory.

Who boasts of ability

has no merit.

Who parades success

will not last.

In Tao (the Laws of the Universe) these things are called

"unwanted food and

extra growths,"

Are rejected

by all things

. A person of the Tao (the Laws of the Universe)

does not want them.

They turn away from them.
