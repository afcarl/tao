In governing a people

and in serving Heaven,

There is nothing like

not being wasteful.

To not be wasteful

is to return before

going away from the path.

To return

before going away

from the path

is to have

a double supply of Virtue (Power).

To have

a double supply of Virtue (Power)

is to overcome everything.

To overcome everything

is to have no limits.

Only they who have no limits can have a kingdom.

Only they who have the true understanding of the Tao can last long.

This is the way

to be deep-rooted and

firm-planted

in the Tao ( the Laws of the Universe ).

This is the secret of

long life and

lasting understanding.
