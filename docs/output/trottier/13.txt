"Welcome disgrace

as a pleasant surprise.

Prize misfortunes

as your own body."

Why should we

"welcome disgrace

as a pleasant surprise"?

Because a lowly state is a boon:

Getting it is a pleasant surprise,

And so is losing it!

That is why we should

"welcome disgrace

as a pleasant surprise."

Why should we

"prize misfortunes

as our own body"?

Because our body

is the very source

of our misfortunes

. If we have no body,

what misfortunes

can we have?

Only he

who is willing to

give their body

for the sake of the world

is fit to be

entrusted

with the world.

Only they

who can do it

with love

and regard themselves

as the world

are worthy of being

the steward of the world.
