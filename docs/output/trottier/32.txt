Tao (the Laws of the Universe) is always nameless.

Small as it is in its First Simplicity,

It is less than nothing in the world.

If only a leader could stick to it, Everything will give respect

to them.

Heaven and Earth

will be harmonized

And send down sweet dew.

Peace and order

will reign among the people

Without any command from above.

When once

the Primal Simplicity broke up,

(at the Time of the Big Bang,)

Different names appeared.

Are there not enough names now?

Is this not the time to stop?

To know where to stop is to preserve ourselves from danger.

The Tao (the Laws of the Universe) is to the world

what a great river or an ocean is to the streams and brooks.

The Tao is manifest into a shape, but then the shape is lost.

Do not be rigid about shapes, but only about ability to change.
