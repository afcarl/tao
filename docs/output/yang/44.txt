Fame or health, which is dearer to you?
Health or wealth, which is more important to you?
Gain or loss, which hurts you more?
The more you love something, the more you have to pay.
The more wealth you accumulate, the more likely you will lose it.
If you know when to be satisfied, you will not be insulted,
If you know when to stop, you will not be hurt,
This is how you last long.
