Those who use the DAO to assist their monarchs do not rely on force to conquer the world.
If you use force, it so easily comes back and haunts you.
Thorns will grow where the army camped,
A year of starvation will follow a big war.
A person who understands war will only fight to win a war,
Not to use force to conquer the world.
After winning a war, do not be self-satisfied.
After winning a war, do not show off.
After winning a war, do not be conceited.
After winning a war, treat it like you were forced to fight.
After winning a war, do not use force to conquer the world.
When things become too strong, they start to decay,
Which is against the DAO.
Being against the DAO will lead to an early destruction.
