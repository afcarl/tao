From the beginning, everything has needed to become natural and harmonic, which is called ONE.
When the sky becomes ONE, it is clear;
When the earth becomes ONE, it is peaceful;
When the spirits become ONE, they grant all wishes;
When the riverbeds and valleys become ONE, they fill with water;
When all living things become ONE, they grow;
When the kings become ONE, they can govern their countries.
This is because of the DAO.
If the sky is not clear, it will collapse;
If the earth is not peaceful, it will explode;
If spirits cannot grant wishes, they will disappear;
If all living things cannot grow, they will die;
If kings cannot govern their countries, they will be overthrown.
Therefore, the cheap is the base of the noble; the low is the foundation of the high.
So the kings always called themselves bad names like the single, the widower, and the unkind.
Is this proof that the cheap is the base of the noble? Is it not?
Therefore, pursuing fame will get you no fame.
Do not be like a beautiful jade; be instead like a plain stone.
