Be humble to the utmost and be peaceful wholeheartedly.
Everything in the world is functioning, and I see the cycle of life and death.
Everything in the world will eventually go back to the root.
Going back to the root means peace, or going to destiny.
Going to destiny means following nature's way.
Understanding nature's way makes your mind clear.
If you do not understand nature's way and you violate it,
You will meet with disaster.
Understanding nature's way makes you tolerant;
Tolerance makes you fair,
Fairness makes you a good ruler,
Being a good ruler makes you conform to nature,
Conformity with nature leads you to the DAO.
The DAO lets you last long and never be defeated in your lifetime.
