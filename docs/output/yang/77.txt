Isn't the law of heavens like using a bow and arrow?
When it is aimed too high, it is lowered; when it is aimed too low, it is raised;
When it is aimed too far, it is loosened; when it is aimed too close, it is tightened.
The law of the heavens is to reduce the wealthy and give to the needy.
But the law of present-day people is just the opposite: they take from the needy to give to the wealthy.
Who can contribute the surplus to the needy?
Only the people who follow the DAO.
So the great men do not do things for themselves and do not claim credit when things are accomplished.
They just do not want to show their goodness.
