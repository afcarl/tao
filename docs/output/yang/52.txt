Since the beginning of the world, the DAO has been the mother of everything.
If you know the mother, the DAO, you know the child, the world.
Knowing the world, but also keeping the DAO, will prevent disasters throughout your life.
If you shut off your senses and desires, you will not have any trouble throughout your life;
If you open your senses and you do things for your own purposes, you cannot be saved throughout your life.
By focusing on the minor and subtle, your vision is clear;
By staying on the side of weak, you are strong.
Using the "light" of the world, but also keeping the "light source" of the DAO,
Will bring no harm to you and make you natural and long-lasting.
