The great men did not have a fixed will;
they made the people's will their own.
When people are kind, I treat them kindly;
when people are unkind, I still treat them kindly;
this is called the kindness of DE.
When people are credible, I have faith in them;
when people are not credible, I still have faith in them;
this is called the faith of DE.
The great men were very cautious when governing their country;
They made the people simple and plain.
The people focused on their every movement, and the great men treated them like their children.
