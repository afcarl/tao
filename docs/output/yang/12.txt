Too much color makes one blind;
Too much sound makes one deaf;
Too much flavor makes one lose his appetite.
Horse racing and hunting makes one's heart wild;
Scarce and valuable things makes one want to steal.
Therefore, great men made people value basic needs, not luxuries.
So, they kept the former and threw away the latter.
