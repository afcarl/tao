The DAO has no name, but it is always present.
It is simple and small, but no one can conquer it.
If the kings are able to practice it, everybody will come and obey by themselves.
The heavens and the earth will be in harmony,
And rain will pour down from the sky.
People will take care of themselves without need of the law.
Since there were names, everything got its own place.
People should know when to stop;
If they know when to stop, they can avoid disasters.
The world comes to the DAO like every stream and river comes to the ocean.
