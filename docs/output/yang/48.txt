The more you study a subject, the more you know;
the more you study the DAO, the less you know;
Less and less, until at the end you achieve WUWEI.
By WUWEI, you can accomplish everything.
If you want to govern a country, always try to let nothing happen;
If you make things happen, you are not suitable for governing the country.
