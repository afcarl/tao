My teaching is very easy to understand and very easy to practice.
However, in this world, no one understands it and no one practices it.
Your speech must be based on facts, your actions must follow principles.
Only because people do not understand the DAO, do they not understand me.
Few people know my teaching; even fewer people follow my cause.
Therefore, the great men wore coarse clothing, but hid treasures inside.
