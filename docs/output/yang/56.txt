People who have knowledge do not talk about it;
people who like to talk about it do not have knowledge.
Shut off your senses, block your desires,
Dull your sharpness, untie your knots with the outside world,
Dim your brightness, and make yourself as low as dust;
This will lead you to the world of the DAO.
Therefore, no one can own the DAO,
No one can cast it away,
No one can benefit it,
No one can hurt it,
No one can make it noble,
No one can make it low;
This is why the DAO is the noblest.
