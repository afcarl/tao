When the situation is peaceful, it is easy to control;
when nothing has happened, it is easy to plan;
Brittle things are easily broken, thin things are easily dispersed.
Do things when they have not yet happened, control things when they are not yet out of control.
A full-grown tree began as a sapling;
A nine-story building began with a bucket of dirt;
A thousand-mile trip began with the first step.
If you fiddle with something for your own purposes, you will ruin it;
If you are stubborn, you will fail.
Therefore, the great men practiced WUWEI, so they did not fail anything;
They were not stubborn, so they did not make mistakes.
People often fail at the last step to success.
Be cautious at the end like you are at the beginning; then you will never fail.
Therefore, the great men treated having no desire as their desire, and did not value things that were precious.
They treated not learning as learning, and repaired the mistakes people had made.
They helped everything and made them natural, but did not dare to do things for their own purposes.
