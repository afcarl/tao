The big DAO is like a flood, going everywhere.
Everything depends on it to grow, but it never refuses to help.
When things are accomplished, it never claims credit.
It nurtures everything, but never tries to control them.
It never has desires, so it can be called the SMALL.
Everything depends on it, but it never tries to be their master, so it can be called the BIG.
Only because it never wants to be the BIG, so it becomes the BIG.
