The DAO always practices WUWEI, but there is nothing that it cannot do.
If the kings can use the DAO, people will take care of themselves.
When people get freedom, they begin to have desires;
I will then use this nameless and simple DAO to guide them.
This nameless and simple DAO will make them have no desires.
Without desires, they will be peaceful, and the country will keep stability by itself.
