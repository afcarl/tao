The people who are good at building things do not budge,
The people who are good at protecting thing do not lose any part,
So their descendents can celebrate and remember them forever.
If a person can build such a DE, the DE will be real;
If a family can build such a DE, the DE will be plentiful;
If a town can build such a DE, the DE will last long;
If a country can build such a DE, the DE will be bountiful;
If the entire world can build such a DE, the DE will be everywhere.
Therefore, you know others by looking at yourself;
You know other families by looking at your family;
You know other towns by looking at your town;
You know other countries by looking at your country;
You know the past and future by looking at the present.
How do I know everything in the world? This is how.
