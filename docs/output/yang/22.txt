If you can bear unfairness, you can make yourself a complete person.
If you can bear overbending, you can be straightened out.
If you can bear the old, you can gain the new.
When you have too little, you will gain;
When you have too much, you will lose.
Therefore, the great men kept the DAO and made themselves the models for the world.
They were not stubborn, so they knew the right and the wrong.
They were not narrow-minded, so everyone accepted their opinions.
They did not show off, so everyone recognized their accomplishments.
They were not conceited, so they were able to lead the people.
Only because they did not fight for the credit, was no one able to claim it.
Is the old saying "bearing the unfairness makes you a complete man" an empty joke?
No, because it is completely consistent with the DAO.
