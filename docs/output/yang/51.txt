The DAO gives birth to everything, the DE looks after everything,
The elements give a shape to everything, and nature makes everything grow and mature.
Therefore, everything respects the DAO and values the DE.
The dignity of the DAO and the nobleness of the DE are not forced upon anything, but allow everything to be natural.
So, the DAO gives birth to everything, the DE looks after everything;
They grow and cultivate everything, making them complete and mature;
They bring everything up and protect them.
Giving birth to everything but not owning them,
Taking care of everything but not claiming the credit,
Leading everything but not controlling them;
This is called real DE.
