Weapons are not auspicious, but very annoying.
So, people who follow the DAO do not use them.
Noble men value their left side in daily life and their right side in battle.
Weapons are not auspicious, not something noble men like to use.
They use them only when they have to, and they treat them like they do not matter.
After winning a war, do not be delighted.
Those who are delighted love to kill.
The people who love to kill cannot be allowed to control the country.
At celebrations, the left side is respected; at funerals, the right side is respected.
In a war, the subordinate is on the left side and the commander is on the right side.
Therefore, a war should be talked about like a funeral.
When many are killed, people should cry to show sadness.
Winning a war should be treated like a funeral.
