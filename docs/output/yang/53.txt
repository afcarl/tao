If one day I am to have desires,
As I am walking along a big road, I am only afraid of straying into the small alleys.
The big road is so smooth, but people prefer to take the small alleys.
The government is a mess, the fields are barren, and the barns are empty,
But they wear bright and colorful clothing, carrying sharp swords, overeat and overdrink;
They steal countless treasures, so they are the heads of thieves.
This is completely against the DAO!
