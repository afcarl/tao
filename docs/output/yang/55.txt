The people who have the thickest DE are like a naked newborn boy.
The snake does not sting him, the wild animal does not bite him, and the fierce bird does not claw him.
His bones are soft and his muscles are weak, but his grip is very strong.
He has no idea of making love, but his manhood is always rigid,
Because his body is in the purest state.
He cries all day, but does not go hoarse,
Because his body is in the most harmonic state.
Understanding this harmonic state makes you natural,
Understanding the natural way makes your mind clear.
Trying hard to make your life last longer only brings you bad luck,
Trying to be strong-willed against nature only makes you lifeless.
When things become strong, they start to break down,
Which is not in accordance with the DAO.
Not being in accordance with the DAO leads to an early death.
