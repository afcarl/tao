The best is like water.
Water benefits everything without fighting for credit.
Only without fighting for credit, will water never get any trouble.
It flows to the lowest places where no one wants to stay,
So water is the closest to the DAO.
Therefore, one should have the traits of water:
Humble and lowly in his character,
Peaceful and deep in his heart,
Charitable in his treatment of everything,
Credible in his words,
Methodical in his ways of governing a country,
Capable of doing anything,
And able to catch opportunities when taking action.
Only without fighting for credit, will one never get any trouble.
