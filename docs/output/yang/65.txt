The ancient people who knew the DAO did not make people smart, but made them simple.
People are not easy to govern when they are too smart.
So, those who govern a country based on smartness are a disaster to the country.
Those who do not govern the country based on smartness are a fortune to the country.
These two ways are the long-lasting policies for governing a country.
Keeping these two policies is called real DE.
Real DE is so deep and far-reaching; it is opposite to what we know today.
However, it will eventually lead to the ultimate harmonic and natural state.
