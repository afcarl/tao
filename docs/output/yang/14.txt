If you look at it but cannot see it, this is called YI.
If you listen to it but cannot hear it, this is called XI.
If you touch it but cannot feel it, this is called WEI.
These three things cannot be fully understood.
Therefore, they are mixed into one thing: the DAO.
Its top is not bright, its bottom is not dark;
It is so elusive it cannot be described.
It is not a physical entity,
Having a shape that is shapeless and an image without an object.
This is why it is so elusive and dynamic.
When you look at the front, it has no beginning.
When you look behind, it has no end.
It allows you to apply the real knowledge of the past to the present.
Therefore, if you understand the real knowledge of the past,
You understand the principles of the DAO.
