If you do not worship the nobility, there will be no fighting among people.
If you do not value scarce items, there will be no stealing.
If you do not show people temptations, their hearts will not be wild.
Therefore, the great men's ways of governing people were:
To remove their greed but fill their stomachs,
To weaken their ambition but strengthen their bodies.
Always keep them without knowledge and without desires,
And this prevents those clever manipulators from doing anything.
