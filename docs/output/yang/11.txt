A wooden wheel has thirty spokes:
Carve out the center to make it useful for a carriage.
A piece of clay is used to make a container:
Take out some clay from the middle to form a pot.
A house has four walls:
Empty the inside to make a room.
Therefore, having materials provides the resources,
But getting rid of some of it makes the materials useful.
