When people who have high DE learn about the DAO, they practice it diligently;
When people who have medium DE learn about the DAO, they sometimes treat it seriously, sometimes do not;
When people who have low DE learn about the DAO, they give it a big laugh.
If they do not laugh, the DAO is not the DAO.
Therefore, the great men once said,
"People who understand the DAO look dull;
The more you learn about the DAO, the more you feel like you are retreating;
The DAO looks like a smooth road, but when you walk on it, it is rough."
The people who have high DE always look as low as the valleys and riverbeds.
The people who have broad DE always look incomplete.
The people who have strong DE always look lazy.
The people who have real DE always look empty.
The whitest looks tainted,
The squarest looks like it has no right angle,
The greatest piece takes the longest time,
The biggest sound has no sound,
The biggest shape has no shape.
The DAO likes to hide and be anonymous.
Because the DAO always gives, it accomplishes everything.
