Only the DAO has the behavior of the most magnificent DE.
The DAO looks elusive and vague.
It seems abstract, but it has the world as its foundation.
It appears intangible and far away, but it contains the basic elements of the world.
These elements are present everywhere, making its existence known.
From the beginning to the present, the name of the DAO has always existed,
Experiencing all generations.
How do I know everything in the past? Because I know the DAO.
