Whoever wants to fiddle with the world for his own purposes,
I expect that he will fail.
The world is something sacred that cannot be fiddled with.
Whoever fiddles with it will ruin it, whoever obtains it will lose it.
Therefore, among the things in the world, some go first,
some follow behind;
Some are slow, some are fast;
Some are strong, some are weak;
Some are helpful, some are destructive.
So, the great men removed the excess, the extra, and the extreme.
