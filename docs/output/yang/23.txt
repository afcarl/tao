Talking little is the way of nature.
A blustering wind cannot last a whole morning;
A downpour cannot last a whole day.
Who can control this? Only nature.
Even nature cannot make a storm last long, so how can people?
Therefore, one who believes in the DAO receives the DAO,
One who pursues the DE has the DE,
One who does not believe in anything is lost.
The one who gets the DAO will receive the blessings of the DAO,
The one who has the DE will receive the blessings of the DE,
The one who is lost will receive nothing.
If you do not have faith in the DAO, the DAO will not have faith in you.
