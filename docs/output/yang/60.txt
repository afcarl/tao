Governing a big country is like carefully cooking a small fish.
When the DAO rules, ghosts will not show their spirits.
Not only will the ghosts not show their spirits, but also the spirits will not hurt people.
Not only will the spirits not hurt people, but also the great men will not hurt people.
When neither the spirits nor the great men hurt people, the DE becomes natural and lasts long.
