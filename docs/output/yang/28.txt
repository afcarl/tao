Knowing you can be strong, but choosing to be weak,
Is like being the creeks and streams of the world.
If you can be the creeks and streams of the world,
The DE will never leave you, and you will return to the natural state of a newborn.
Knowing you can be bright, but choosing to be dull,
Is like being the model of perfection for the world.
If you can be the model of perfection for the world,
The DE will not stray from you, and you will return to the unlimited state.
Knowing you can be glorious, but choosing to be humiliated,
Is like being the valleys and canyons of the world.
If you can be the valleys and the canyons of the world,
The DE will always be sufficient for you, and you will return to the plain and simple state.
Being simple and relaxed makes things useful, so the great men used it to lead the people.
Therefore, a great system is one that does not hurt anything.
