It started in chaos, before the heavens and the earth existed.
It makes no sound and has no shape,
But it is independent and never changes.
It is always functioning and never stops,
So it can be the root of the world.
I do not know its name, so I name it the DAO,
And I will also call it the BIG.
BIG means broad, broad means far-reaching,
Far-reaching means everywhere.
Therefore, the DAO is BIG, the heavens is BIG,
The earth is BIG, and people are BIG, too.
The universe has four BIGs, and people are only one of them.
People follow the earth, the earth follows the heavens,
The heavens follows the DAO, and the DAO follows nature.
