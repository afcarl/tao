People in the past who practiced the DAO understood the real essence of the world so deeply that the ordinary people could not appreciate them.
Because these people cannot be appreciated and understood,
I will try to give you a rough sketch of them.
They acted very cautiously, like walking on thin ice.
They behaved very carefully, like being watched by everybody.
They looked very dignified, like going to a banquet.
They were very warm and kind, like being able to melt ice.
They were very plain, like a block of uncarved wood.
They had a very big heart, like a deep valley.
They were very tolerant, like a flooding river that contains everything.
Who can get clear water from mud by letting the mud settle slowly?
Who can create new things gradually from stillness by taking the initiative?
These people who kept the DAO were never conceited.
Only because they were not conceited,
Were they able to create the future while preserving the past.
