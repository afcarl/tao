The most ideal country has little land and few people;
The people have many technologies but do not use them;
They are afraid of death and do not migrate far.
Even though they have boats and carriages, they do not use them;
Even though they have weapons and soldiers, they do not fight battles.
People go back to the ancient ways of life.
They enjoy their own food, admire their own clothes,
Appreciate their own peaceful lives, and love their own traditions.
Even if the people can see neighboring countries and hear the sounds of their cocks and dogs,
Up to their deaths, they never go there.
