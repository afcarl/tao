Everyone knows that beauty is good, but ugliness exists as well.
Everyone knows that kindness is good, but unkindness exists as well.
Therefore, nothingness and existence always coexist;
As do difficulty and easiness, long and short, high and low, and sound and hearing.
For this reason, the great men practiced WUWEI.
They wordlessly taught people and let the world develop by itself.
Create but do not control, nurture but do not own, accomplish but do not claim.
Only when you do not claim the accomplishment, will it never leave.
