Whether people listen to me or ignore me, what difference does it make?
Whether people treat me well or not well, what difference does it make?
Although things that others are afraid of I have to be afraid of too,
How big the difference is between them and me!
When everyone is excited, like going to a festival or spring outing,
Only I am quiet, like nothing has happened.
I am like a newborn infant that does not know how to laugh,
Bored and tired, that has no home to return to.
When everyone has so much excess energy, only I am left behind.
I have a fool's heart, so dumb!
Everyone seems bright, only I am dull.
Everyone seems to know everything, only I am confused.
My heart spreads like an endless ocean.
My mind wanders like a boundless wind.
Everyone seems competent, only I am slow and stupid.
I am so different from the others, because I am devoted to the DAO.
