Nature is not charitable; it neglects everything like a used grass-dog after sacrifice.
Great men were not charitable; they neglected people like a used grass-dog after sacrifice.

Empty, but always able to produce wind; the more you push, the more wind comes out.
Talking too much will lead to embarrassment: be like the bellows and keep the wind inside.
