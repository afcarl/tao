If it wants to shrink something, it always first expands it.
If it wants to weaken something, it always first strengthens it.
If it wants to get rid of something, it always first promotes it.
If it wants to take something, it always first gives it away.
These are delicate wisdoms, which is that the weak overcome the strong.
Big fish cannot leave deep water;
National security secrets cannot be shown to outsiders.
