The great rivers and oceans can hold the water of all the streams.
Because they are lower, the water flows to them.
Therefore, if you want to be the head of the people, you must first humble yourself;
If you want to lead the people, you must first put yourself behind.
This is why the great men were above the people, but the people did not feel burdened;
They were in front of the people, but the people did not feel harmed.
So, the people were happy to make the great men their leaders, and did not feel tired of them.
Only because the great men did not fight, was there no one who could compete with them.
