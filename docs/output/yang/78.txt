Nothing in this world is softer than water;
However, nothing in this world is more powerful than water in breaking the hardest things,
And nothing in this world can replace water.
Everyone knows this, but no one acts according to it.
So, the great men said:
"Those who can share the humiliation of the country can be the masters of the country;
Those who can share the disasters of the country can be the rulers of the country."
These truthful words sound like nonsense to present-day people.
