The DAO is the protector of everything.
Kind people treat it like a treasure;
Unkind people also seek its protection.
The DAO makes people say nice words, and thus, they are respected.
The DAO makes people do good deeds, and thus, they are greater.
Even for the unkind people, have you ever seen the DAO neglect them?
Therefore, being an emperor or a minister, receiving jade gifts, or being equipped with fast carriers are not as precious as having the DAO.
Why did the ancient people value the DAO?
Did they not say that it is for gaining things and redeeming sins?
So the DAO is the most valuable thing in the world.
