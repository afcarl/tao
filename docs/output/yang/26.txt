Heaviness is the base of lightness,
Peace is the master of commotion.
Therefore, when the great men traveled,
They never let their carriages out of sight.
No matter how beautiful and entertaining the scenery was,
They acted as though they did not even see it.
How can the rulers of today behave more carelessly than anyone?
Lightness will cause the loss of the base,
Commotion will cause the loss of the master.
