Skillful driving leaves no tracks.
Skillful talking contains no blunders.
Skillful calculating needs no instruments.
Skillful securing requires no lock, but cannot be opened.
Skillful tying uses no knots, but cannot be untied.
Therefore, the great men were always good at making all people useful, so no one was left out;
They were very good at making all other things useful, so nothing was wasted.
This is why they were considered to be genuinely wise.
So, the kind are the teachers of the unkind;
The unkind are the resources of the kind.
If a person does not value the teachers or the resources,
No matter how smart he is, he is completely lost.
Therefore, this is an extremely important wisdom.
