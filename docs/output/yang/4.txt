The DAO looks empty, but it can last forever.
It is so deep, it can be the ancestor of everything.
It dulls its sharpness, unties itself from the outside world,
Dims its brightness, and makes itself like dust.
It is so elusive, yet seems present.
I do not know its origin;
It should exist before the God that people worship.
