When the DAO is thrown away, charity and righteousness have to be used to govern people.
When simplicity is replaced by smartness and calculations, there will be a lot of wicked people.
Only when a family is not in harmony, will a good son or father become precious;
Only when a country is in ruins, will heroes appear.
