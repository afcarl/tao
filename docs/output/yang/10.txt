To devote your soul and body to the DAO, can you never leave it?
To focus your inner energy to the softest, can you be like a newborn?
To remove your inner dust and see the DAO, can your mind be as clean as a mirror?
To love your people and govern your country, can you practice WUWEI?
To control your desires, can you be as humble as a female?
To understand everything, can you stay without knowledge?
Create and nurture but do not own,
Do things but do not claim credit,
Lead but do not control.
These are real DE.
