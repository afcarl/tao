When governing a big country, you should be humble,
Like the lowest point where water meets, or like the females of the world.
Females always overcome males by being peaceful; being peaceful is humble.
Therefore, if a big country humbles itself to a small country, it can lead the small country;
If a small country humbles itself to a big country, it can get help from the big country.
So, humbleness leads either to leading a small country or to getting help from a big country.
A big country always wants to lead a small country,
A small country always wants to get help from a big country;
They can achieve their goals by being humble.
So the big should be humble.
