The best thing in life is to be thrifty.
Only when you are thrifty, can you be prepared ahead of time.
Preparing ahead of time allows you to accumulate more DE.
Accumulating more DE allows you to overcome everything.
Overcoming everything allows you to have unmeasurable limits.
Having unmeasurable limits allows you to control a country.
When a country has the DAO, it can last long.
This is how you deepen and secure your roots, live long and last forever.
