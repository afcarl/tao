Of people's lives from beginning to end,
One-third live long,
One-third die young,
And one-third live in the beginning, but cause their deaths half way by themselves.
Why do people die in the middle of their lives?
Because they live too well and do not cherish their lives.
It is said that those who know how to live long never come across a rhinoceros or a tiger;
When they are in battle, they never get hurt.
The rhinoceros has no place to impale them with its horn,
The tiger has no place to attack them with its claws,
And the weapon has no place to hurt them with its blade.
Why is this? Because they never get themselves into these deadly places.
