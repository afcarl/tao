If you can understand others, you are wise;
If you can understand yourself, your mind is clear.
If you can overcome others, you are powerful;
If you can overcome yourself, you are strong.
If you can be satisfied, you are rich;
If you can be persistent, you are determined.
If you never lose your goals, you can last long;
If you die but you are not forgotten, then you live forever.
