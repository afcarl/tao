The best ruler, the people do not feel his presence.
The second best, the people love and praise him.
The third best, the people fear him.
The worst, the people insult him.
If a ruler does not fully trust his people,
The people will not trust him.
A good ruler lets his people be free and rarely gives orders.
So, when things are accomplished, the people say,
"This is what we are suppose to do."
