When the government is low-key, the people are sturdy and simple;
When the government is harsh, the people are selfish and heartless.
Fortune is followed by disaster,
Disaster is followed by fortune.
Who knows the ultimate outcome of this cycle? No one knows.
The straight can become crooked; the kind can become wicked.
People have not figured out this puzzle for a long time.
So the great men were square but not rigid, self-abstaining but did not hurt people, upright but not blunt, glowing but not blinding.
