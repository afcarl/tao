The people who have high DE do not purposely show the DE, but ultimately have the DE.
The people who have low DE are always afraid of not showing the DE, but ultimately lose the DE.
The people who have high DE practice WUWEI, but ultimately get everything done.
The people who have low DE do things purposely, but ultimately fail in many things.
The kind people do not do things purposely, but get everything done well.
The highly righteous people do things purposely, but ultimately fail in many things.
The people who follow courtesy and orders do everything purposely, but when no one follows them, they rudely force people to do so.
Therefore, when the DAO is lost, charity appears;
When charity is lost, righteousness appears;
When righteousness is lost, courtesy and order appear.
Courtesy and order have little loyalty and faith, and they are the source of chaos.
Therefore, they are the end of the DAO and the beginning of a dark age.
Noble men always stay sturdy, not shallow; solid, not flimsy.
So one should keep the former and get rid of the latter.
