If you have the courage to be strong, you will fail;
If you have the courage to be weak, you will succeed.
These two courages have completely opposite results.
Who knows why the heavens does not like the strong?
Even the great men found this question difficult to answer.
The law of the heavens never fights but always wins,
Never speaks but always gets a response,
Never calls but always gets an answer,
Moves slowly but has everything arranged perfectly.
The law of the heavens is like a huge net; the net holes are large, but nothing can escape.
