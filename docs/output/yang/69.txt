There is a saying in the military:
"I dare not attack but would rather retreat;
I dare not move forward an inch but would rather move back a foot."
This is called advancing without appearing to advance,
Making a resolution without rolling up your sleeves,
Carrying a weapon without revealing the weapon,
Preparing to fight without showing the preparation.
The biggest disaster is to underestimate the enemy;
Underestimating the enemy will cause you to lose all your armies.
When two fighting armies have similar strength, the side that is sorrowful and cautious will win.
