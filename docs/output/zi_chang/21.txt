The capacity of Grand Virtues is obtained only by following Dao.
Dao is a matter, even though it is indistinct and elusive.
It is elusive and indistinct, yet within it All Images are formed;
It is indistinct and elusive, yet within it All Things are created;
It is shadowy and obscure, yet within it All Vitalities are produced.
It's own vitality is real and valid.
Throughout the past and present the name of Dao has never been dropped.
It observes All Origins.
How do we know that All Origins are so?
By these observations.
