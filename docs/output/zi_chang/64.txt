What is still at rest is easy to maintain.
What is still insignificant is easy to dispose of.
What is still fragile is easily shattered.
What is still not yet begun is easy to plan.
Action should be taken before the emergency occurs.
Measures should be taken before confusion is formed.
A large tree, so large arms can hardly go around, was grown from a tiny seed.
A tall tower, of nine stories height, was built first with a handful of dirt.
A long journey of a thousand miles can be finished by moving feet.
One who intervenes will be defeated.
One who grasps the world will lose it.
So the Sage ruler does not intervene, thus he does not fail.
He does not grasp, thus he never loses.
Sometimes people fail to reach the end when they are already on the verge of success.
A Sage was as cautious at the end as in the beginning, so he could avoid failure.
Thus a Sage ruler never desired what should not be desired, such as he never cherished rare goods.
He did not experience what should not be experienced, such as he never repeated the faults of others.
It gives supplementary help to the nature of All Things, and yet it dares not to assert itself.
