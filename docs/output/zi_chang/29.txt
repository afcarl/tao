Will anybody want to lead the world according to his selfish design?
I see that he will never attain his end.
The sacred instrument of the world cannot be grasped or intervened:
one who intervenes will be defeated;
one who grasps will lose it.
Among things:
some are moving ahead, others are following behind;
some are breathing in air, others are breathing in water;
some are strong, others are weak;
some are still carried on and some are dropped.
Therefore, a Sage ruler avoided:
Extreme, Extravagance and Indulgence.
