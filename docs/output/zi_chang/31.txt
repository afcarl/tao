War is an unlucky instrument.
It is hated by everything!
Thus a man of Dao will never resort to use it.
A position taken by a gentle official is on the right - honorable side;
the position taken by a war conductor is on the left - less honorable side.
War is an unlucky instrument, it is not the instrument of a gentle ruler.
They are obligated to die and utilized by the authority.
To keep calm and have peace of mind is to be superior.
Victory of war is not delightful:
if one delights in war, he delights in killing people;
if one delights in killing people, it will never be possible for him to be at peace with the world.
Thus on happy occasions the right side is honored.
On sad occasions the left side is honored.
During a war, many people are killed,
It should be taken mournfully.
Even a victory should be treated as a funeral.
