Truth is not beautiful;
and beauty is not true.
One who is right may not argue;
and one who argues may not be right.
One who knows the special may not know the general;
and one who knows the general may not know the special.
Thus, a Sage ruler never concentrated his wealth:
What has been done for others makes him feel even better himself.
What has been distributed to others makes him feel richer himself.
Dao of Nature is to benefit and is not to injure.
Dao of a Sage ruler is to serve, and is not aggressive.
