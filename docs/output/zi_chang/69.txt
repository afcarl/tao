The Conduct of War has this to say:
"I dare not take the initiative but rather to be resistant.
I dare not advance an inch but rather I withdraw a foot."
So that, engage the enemy without advancing.
Drive out the enemy without arms.
Subdue the enemy without battle.
Take the enemy with invincibility.
No fault is greater than to underestimate the enemy:
To underestimate the enemy is to destroy all my treasured principles.
When an army of resistance engages, the mournful one - the army of resistance, wins.
