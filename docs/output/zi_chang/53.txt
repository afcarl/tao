If I have just a little wisdom to lead me to approach the superior way of Dao, I fear that I may stray from it.
The superior way of Dao is plain and yet man prefers devious paths.
When government officers are very neglected;
farm lands are very weedy;
public granaries are very empty;
yet, brilliant clothes are displayed;
sharp swords are carried;
and excessive food and drinks are over used, and personal wealth and treasures are abundant.
This is called "Exhibition of Robbery".
Really it is aberration of Dao!
