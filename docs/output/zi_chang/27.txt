The perfect traveler does not need a trail.
The perfect speaker does not leave any argument.
The perfect planner does not need a sketch.
The perfect door does not need a latch.
The perfect binder does not need string.
Hence Sage rulers always perfectly saved people, thus nobody was abandoned;
and always perfectly saved things, thus nothing was wasted.
This is called "blocking enlightenment".
The good person is the teacher of the bad person.
A bad person is a lesson for the good person.
Esteem the teacher and be aware of the lesson.
Otherwise even though one is intelligent, he will be misguided.
These are the marvelous functions of Dao.
