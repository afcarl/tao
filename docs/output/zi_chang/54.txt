What is perfectly planted will not be uprooted.
What is perfectly held will not slip away.
Through generations the family's memorial service will not be discontinued.
Thus,
by cultivating Dao in a person, virtues become manifest;
by cultivating Dao in a family, virtues become abundant;
by cultivating Dao in the community, virtues become enduring;
by cultivating Dao in a country, virtues become flourishing;
and by cultivating Dao in the world, virtues become universal.
Thus,
by taking care of one's self, one takes care of others;
by taking care of one's family, one takes care of others' families;
by taking care of one's own community, one takes care of others' communities;
by taking care of one's own country, one takes care of others' countries;
and by taking care of the world, one takes care of the universe.
How do we know in what way the world should be ruled?
Through this.
