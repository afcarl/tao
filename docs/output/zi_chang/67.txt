All in the world may think that Dao is unlike to be so superior, that nothing in the world can compare to it.
If it were comparable to anything, it would be inferior.
If it is not superior, it would not be Dao.
I have three treasured strategies to which I hold fast and embrace them all:
the first is Mercy;
the second is Economy of Force;
and the third is Dare Not to Take Initiative Before the World.
Because of Mercy, one can be courageous.
Because of Economy of Force, one can have superior force.
Because of Dare Not To Take Initiative Before the World, one can be the master of instruments.
Alas!
Nowadays, rulers want to be brave without being merciful;
want to have superior force without knowing economy of force;
and want to take initiative without being able to be resistant.
They will surely die in the war.
Mercy helps one to win when on the offensive;
to consolidate when on the defensive.
If one guides oneself by mercy Heavens will protect him.
