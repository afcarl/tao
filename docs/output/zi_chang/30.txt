A ruler who is in accord with Dao will never use military force to override the world,
Because this kind of affair ensures reciprocal killing.
Once an army has operated in the field there is nothing left growing but thorny bushes.
Once a great war is over, invariably there are horrible years following.
The perfect fighter is decisive, yet he does not allow himself to be violent.
Decisive but not proud;
decisive but not boastful and decisive when he is obliged to fight.
Be decisive but not aggressive.
A matured living body will soon grow old.
That is called "aberration of Dao".
Aberration of Dao will cause early death.
