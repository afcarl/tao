By positive policy rule the kingdom, by negative strategy conduct the war and by unselfish design lead the world.
How do we know that is so?
By this:
Where there were more taboos and inhibitions in the country, the general public was getting poorer and poorer.
Where there were more new tools and techniques in the hands of certain people, there were more confusions and injustices in the government.
The more laws and decrees were issued, the more robbers and crooks were propagated.
Thus a Sage ruler said:
"If I do not interfere, the people will cultivate themselves naturally.
If I love to be inactive, the people will govern themselves automatically.
If I do not look for display, the people will enrich themselves automatically.
If I have no excessive desires, the people will return themselves to the Pure Matter naturally.
If I have no emotional needs, the people will tranquilize themselves automatically."
