The courage of one daring to be aggressive will eventually kill his life.
The courage of one not daring to be aggressive will eventually ensure his life.
Between these two kinds of courage we know which one is good and which one is harmful.
Who knows the reason why?
Because it is hated by nature.
The law of Nature does not strive, yet achieves a perfect victory.
It does not use words, yet it is perfectly convincing.
It receives no call, yet it automatically responds.
It is plain and unnoticed, yet it is skillfully planned.
It covers every place all the time like a heavenly net, it seems to be wide meshed, yet it does not let anything slip away.
