The eternity of Dao contrives nothing, yet it provides everything.
If rulers can cling to it - Dao,
All Things will transform (change) themselves.
Any artificial desire occurring during the transformation, shall be suppressed by the nameless "Purity" (Pure Matter).
Nameless "Purity" (Pure Matter) will do away with artificial desires.
When artificial desires have been done away with, all peoples will be at peace and the world order will be established automatically.
