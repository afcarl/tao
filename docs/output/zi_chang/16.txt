To have the greatest capacity of mind, keep it quiet and patient,
All things are resolved in order,
In order to understand the merit of Return.
While individual things are growing simultaneously yet all of them will return eventually to the original root (Pure Matter).
To return toward the original root is to see the static phenomenon.
To see the static phenomenon is to know the original order.
To know the original order is to know the eternal law.
If one does not know the eternal law and acts only by means of trial and error he will end in disaster.
By knowing the eternal law one can have capacity;
by having capacity one can be impartial;
by being impartial one can be perfect;
being perfect one can be superior;
by being superior one can be eternal;
and by being eternal one can approach Dao.
There will be no discontinuation of life, even though a human body will die.
