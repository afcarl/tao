The ancient scholar knew how to be perfect:
keep himself subtle, wonderful, profound and flexible.
He kept his mind so deep that it could not be fathomed!
Because it could not be fathomed, it could only be described superficially:
Hesitatingly, like one who is crossing a stream in winter;
Timidly, like one who is new to his surrounding neighbors;
Reservedly, like a new guest;
Yieldingly, like ice which is melting;
Honest, like Pure Matter;
Obscure, like muddy water;
and Capacious, like a deep valley.
Who can calmly make the muddy (chaotic) clear (orderly)?
Who can calmly change the static (matter) into dynamic (force)?
To return to Dao is to let the capacity of mind not be over-filled.
Only the mind which is not over-filled can renew the old and perfect the new.
