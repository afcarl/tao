Heaviness is the cause of lightness.
Serenity is the effect of restlessness.
Therefore, a commanding officer does not risk parting with his supply trains even for a single day journey.

How could a ruler of "ten thousand chariots" (the King), take a risk lightly before the world?
To be light will then lose the effect.
