The sage ruler had no prejudice of his own.
He made his mind to be based on the mind of the people.
If it was perfect, he liked it;
if it was not perfect, he also liked it:
then perfection was attained.
If it was true, he understood it;
if it was not true, he also understood it:
then truth was attained.
Indifferently, indifferently sage rulers were in the world.
Effortlessly, effortlessly they ruled the world.
The people turned their eyes and ears toward them.
Sage rulers treated all people like their own children.
