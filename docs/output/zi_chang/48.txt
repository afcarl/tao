To learn daily will increase desires.
To follow Dao will daily reduce desires.
Reduce and reduce desires until there is no coveting.
Dao contrives nothing yet it provides everything.
Therefore to lead the world is to be persistently with no intervention.
If there is any intervention, it will be impossible to lead the world.
