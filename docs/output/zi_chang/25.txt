There was something unique manifesting from chaos before the birth of Heaven and Earth.
Remotely!
It stands alone without deviation!
Cyclically!
It moves without an end!
It may be called the mother of the Heaven and the Earth.
We do not know its eternal name but give it the name Dao.
Constrained to give a name, it may be called "Movement".
After moving it is called "Departure".
After departing it is called "Extreme".
To avoid remaining in the extreme, it may be called "Return".
Dao is superior;
the universe is superior;
the world is superior;
and the ruler is superior.
There are four superiors in existence among which the ruler is one.
Thus, the ruler should follow the law of the world.
The world should follow the law of the universe.
The universe should follow the law of Dao.
Dao follows its own law - the law of Nature.
