Dao that can be talked about is not the eternal Dao itself;
A name that can be given is not the eternal thing itself.
The nameless existed
Before the birth of birth of Heaven and Earth - Universe;
The names which were given were after
The birth of All Things.
By the eternity of unknown existence
Comprehend the common essence of things;
By the eternity of Existence
Observe the apparent differences.
These two came from the same origin - the unknown,
But with different names.
They all are called the "profoundness",
Profoundly and profoundly it is the entrance
From which come all wonders.
