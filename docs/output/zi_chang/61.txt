To conduct a policy of a large country should be like a valley staying in the lower ground.
To conduct international affairs the best policy, is to be humble and non-aggressive (inactive).
Everyplace under the sun, all females outsmart the males by inaction.
Be inactive and be humble.
Therefore, the large country which is humble before the small country will lead the small country.
The small country which is humble before the large country will please the large country.
Thus sometimes a country unites the world by being humble and sometimes a country becomes humble in order to unite the world.
What a great country wants is no more than to lead more people.
What the small country wants is no more than to serve others.
To let both of them get what they want is simply to insure that the large country be humble.
