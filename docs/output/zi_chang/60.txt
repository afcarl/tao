To rule a big country should be so simple like cooking small fish.
When the world rule is approaching Dao:
The Ghost and Spirit will not necessarily be divine.
It is not that the Ghost and Spirit will not necessarily be divine but the divine will not be utilized to threaten people with harm.
Not only the divine should not threaten people with harm, the Sage ruler should not threaten people with harm either.
When those two (state and religion) do no harm to each other, both will achieve the same goal - Return to Nature.
