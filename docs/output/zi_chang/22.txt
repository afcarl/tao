Through tolerance can perfection be attained.
By "indirect way" can "direct way" be reached.
Through lowness can highness be maintained.
Through old fashion can new fashion be created.
By "have less" can "have more" be possible.
By having plenty only confusion will result.
Hence one who does not show off is enlightened.
One who does not boast of himself has merit.
One who does not claim credit for himself is popular.
One who does not brandish his success thus leads all.
Because of non-struggle, therefore there is nothing under heaven which can struggle with him.
The ancient saying:
"Through tolerance can perfection be attained."
Is it an empty talk?
Thus, if one attains perfection everything under heaven will follow him.
