To rule the people and serve the world there is nothing better than to follow the model of nature.
To follow the model of nature is to be the early appreciation of Dao.
To be the early appreciation of Dao is to give emphasis to the accumulation of Virtues.
To give emphasis to the accumulation of Virtues there is nothing that cannot be overcome.
When one has nothing that cannot be overcome, then nobody knows his limit.
When nobody knows his limit, then he may have a kingdom to rule.
When one has a kingdom to rule, he may mother (rule) the world.
He may rule everywhere and forever.
This is called the way of deepening the root;
consolidating the sprout;
prolonging the life;
and enduring the rule.
