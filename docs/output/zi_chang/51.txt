Dao gives birth to All Things.
Its virtue nourishes them.
Its Matter forms them, and its Forces perfect them.
Thus among All Things there is none which does not esteem Dao and envy its virtues.
To esteem Dao and envy its Virtues do not take any order whatever, but follow the eternity of Nature.
Since Dao gives life;
and its virtues nourish it, grow it, cultivate it, accomplish it, mature it, nurse it, and protect it.
It produces All Things but it does not possess them.
It provides everything for them but it does not take anything from them.
It leads them but does not lord over them.
It is called "the Profound Virtue".
