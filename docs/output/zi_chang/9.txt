Do not concentrate one's wealth in abundance.
It is far better for one to know where to stop.
Do not beat one's sword sharp, one can never keep its edge for ever.
If their houses are full of gold and jade, they have no way to keep them forever.
If they are proud of having great riches and honors, they just make more troubles for themselves.
When merits have been achieved, fame has been completed - one may withdraw himself.
That is to follow the law of Nature.
