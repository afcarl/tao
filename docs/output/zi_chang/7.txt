Heaven is enduring and earth is lasting.
Why heaven and earth can be enduring and lasting is because they do not live for themselves, thus, they can endure and last.
So that a Sage ruler put himself behind others, and he came to the front;
he excluded himself from struggle with others and he survived.
It is because he was selfless that he fulfilled himself.
