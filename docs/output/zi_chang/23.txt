Let us observe nature:
A heavy rain can hardly outlast the morning;
a violent hurricane can hardly outlast the day.
Who is responsible for this?
The Heaven and the earth - the Nature.
If the Heaven and the earth however can not make things great and lasting, how could a man expect to do even more?
Thus one who practices Dao is in accord with Dao.
One who is in accord with virtues thus attains virtues.
One who is not in accord with Dao loses Dao.
One who is not in accord with virtues loses virtues.
Truth alone is not enough, nevertheless some truth is not true.
