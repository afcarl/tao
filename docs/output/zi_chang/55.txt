The inherited abundance of tender virtues is comparable to a new-born baby:
the poisonous insects may not sting him;
the fierce animals may not touch him;
and birds of prey may not snatch him.
His bones are soft and his muscles are tender, yet, he can hold firm.
It is like an infant who has the organ of reproduction but does not know its function.
This is the perfection of natural vitality.
It is like an infant who cries all day without growing hoarse.
This is the perfection of natural harmony.
To comprehend this harmony is to know the eternal function of Dao.
One who knows the eternities is enlightened.
One who overdoes his living is unlucky.
One whose will overcomes his temper is strong.
A matured living body will soon grow old.
These are called "the aberration of Dao".
The aberration of Dao leads to early extinction.
