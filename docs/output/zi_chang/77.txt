Is not the law of Nature like aiming with a bow?
It brings down the high and lifts up the low;
reduces the excessive, drawing strength;
and increases insufficient, drawing strength.
So that the law of Nature is to diminish the excess and supply the want.
But the way of Man is not so:
He robs the poor and serves the rich!
Who can give his excessive possessions to serve the world?
The man who possesses Dao.
Thus a Sage ruler provided everything but did not take anything.
He accomplished deeds but did not claim them.
That is, he did not display his sagacity.
