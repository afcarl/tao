Since the beginning of Heaven and Earth, there were things attaining balance:
through attaining balance, Heavens equilibrated;
through attaining balance, the Earth became secure;
through attaining balance, minds became calm;
through attaining balance, valleys became capacious;
through attaining balance, All Things became productive;
through attaining balance, rulers achieved justice throughout the world.
Were the heavens are not equilibrated, they might collapse;
were the Earth not secure, it might quake to bits;
were minds not calm, they might be disrupted;
were valleys not capacious, they might dry up;
were All Things non-productive, they might become extinct;
were rulers not obtaining justice throughout the world, they might fall.
Hence, the rulers established the rule based on the ruled;
and the highness was built upon the foundation of the lowness.
When rulers called themselves "orphans", "widows" and "indigents" reminds that they established the rule according to the needs of the ruled.
Did they not?
Thus frequent flattery becomes no flattery.
Therefore, a perfect gentleman has no excessive desires:
He is smooth like smooth jade!
He is solid like solid rock!
