Oceans and rivers can be the destinations of a hundred waters because the former place themselves just lower than the latter, thus they can be the destinations of a hundred waters.
Hence if one wishes to be on top of others he must place himself lower than others;
If he wishes to lead others he must put his own interest behind others.
Hence, when a Sage ruler was on top of others, yet, they did not feel pressure;
when he was in front of others, still, they did not feel hurt.
And the whole world was glad to have him on top, and did not weary of him.
Because of non-struggle, therefore, there is nothing under heaven which can struggle with him.
