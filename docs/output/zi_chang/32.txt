The eternity of Dao has no name:
Even though Pure Matter is infinitely small, its function is so superior that it is next to none,
If rulers can follow the model of nature, everything under the heaven will render homage to them,
Then the people would automatically be equally sufficient without being directed.
It was named after the initiation of regulations, when names were given,
Then one will know how to rest.
To know how to stop will not reach a perilous end.
The application of Dao to the world is like the relation of oceans to rivers.
