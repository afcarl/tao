Modest, and modest will be the government, then prosperous, and prosperous will be the people!
Shrewd will be the government, then discontented, and discontented will be the people!
Catastrophe rests upon fortune.
Fortune underlies catastrophe.
Who knows the ultimate answers?
What is normal soon becomes abnormal.
What is auspicious soon becomes ominous.
Do away with dogmatism!
Indeed, it is a long, long time ago since Man lost his way of Dao!
Therefore, a Sage is:
solidly square but has no sharp corners;
purely austere but not harmful;
straightly upright but not offensive;
humbly modest but not submissive;
and harmoniously bright but not dazzling.
