He who holds fast to the superior model, the whole world may follow him without ado.
They follow him without harm, but with comfort, equality and prosperity.
Musical temptation and food's flavor can stop a traveler on the road.
When Dao is tasted by mouth, it is mild and without flavor.
When it is looked at, it cannot be entirely seen;
when it is listened to, it cannot be entirely heard;
and when it is taken, it cannot be eaten.
