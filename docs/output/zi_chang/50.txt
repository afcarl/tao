Throughout human life, from birth to death:
There are one third who die naturally;
There are one third who die from disease;
And the other one third who die by speeding to death.
For what reasons have they done so?
Because they live by overdrawing upon their lives heavily.
As I used to hear that:
"One who takes good care of his life will not meet a rhinoceros or a tiger when he is traveling on land.
He does not need to wear armour or carry weapons when he is leading an army."
The rhinoceros finds no place to insert its horn.
The tiger finds no place to put its claws.
Weapons of war find no place to thrust their blades.
For what reasons?
Because one never lets himself be in a vulnerable situation.
