Prefer to rule a small kingdom with few people.
Even though there are abundant resources, prefer to use the one tenth or one hundredth.
Care only for their life and refrain from moving far away, even though there were war ships and chariots ready but no place to use them;
and there were arms and weapons ready but no front to deploy them.
He led them to a simple life even by use of "Knotted Cords" again,
To be contented with their foods, be beautiful with their clothes, be satisfied with their homes and be happy with their customs.
The neighboring countries are within sight of each other;
the voices of cocks and dogs were heard from both sides.
Yet the people might grow old and die before they would cross territories of each other.
