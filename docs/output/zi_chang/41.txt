The superior scholar hears of Dao, he may devote himself to it and follow it;
the average scholar hears of Dao, he sometimes understands it and sometimes he ignores it;
and the inferior scholar hears of Dao, he greatly ridicules it.
If it is not superior, it would not be Dao.
Thus, there are sayings in the Book of Establishment:
Enlightened Dao looks as if obscured;
advanced Dao looks as if retreating and the smooth way of Dao looks as if rugged;
high virtue looks as if common;
the superior distinction may seem indistinct;
abundant virtue looks as if insufficient;
vigorous virtue looks as if easy-going and pure virtue looks as if stupidity.
The superior square may seem to be cornerless.
The superior personality may be established late.
The superior sound may have no way to be heard.
The superior model may seem to be insignificant.
The function of Dao has no name.
It is Dao - the impartial law of nature that knows best how to help and accomplish.
