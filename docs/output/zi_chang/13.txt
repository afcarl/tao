What does it mean by "honor and dishonor cause the same excitement"?
People look up to honor and look down upon dishonor.
They are excited when they get the honor;
they also are excited when they lose the honor.
What does it mean by "the great worry of man is because of love for self"?
The reason that we have worry is because we have ourselves.
If we could forget ourselves, what else remains to be our worry?
Hence, if one loves the world as much as himself, he may be able to rule the world.
If one treasures the world as much as himself, he may be trusted with the world.
