One on tiptoe can not stand well.
One with hard breathing can not live long.
One astride can not walk well.
A self-displayer is not enlightened.
A self-asserter is not popular.
A self-approver has no merit.
A self-boaster can not lead.
From the point of view of Dao this is called "surfeit of food and a tumour on the body".
It is hated by everything!
Thus a man of Dao will never resort to it.
