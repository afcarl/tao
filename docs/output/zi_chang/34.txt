How all-pervading the superior Dao is!
It could be on the left, it could be on the right.
Upon it the life of all things depends and it does not deny anyone.
It accomplishes merits but it does not possess fame.
It shields and nourishes All Things but it does not lord over them.
It may be called the Superior.
Hence, a Sage ruler never wishes to be superior.
Therefore he eventually became superior.
