One who knows others is intelligent.
One who knows himself is enlightened.
One who overcomes others has power.
One who disciplines himself has will power.
One who knows satisfaction is rich.
One who overcomes himself is strong.
One who does not lose one's personality, endures.
One who is dead and never forgotten has longevity.
