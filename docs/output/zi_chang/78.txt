Under heaven, there is nothing as soft as water, yet it can penetrate the hard;
while the strong things cannot overcome it.
Be not easy-going!
Thus, weakness overcomes strength and softness overcomes hardness.
Very few people in the world can understand and follow it.
Therefore, the Sage rulers said:
"One whose capacity can sustain blame from the whole kingdom, can be the ruler of the kingdom.
One whose capacity can bear the calamities of the world, can be the ruler of world."
Positive advice may use the opposite way.
