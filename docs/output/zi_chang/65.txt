The perfect ruler of ancient times did not teach the people to be intelligent, but rather taught them to be simple,
Because the difficulty of ruling people is always due to their being too intelligent.
Thus to use intelligence and skills to rule a country is robbing the country;
not to use intelligence and skills to rule a country is blessing the country.
By knowing these two - Dao and virtues, both of them are the models of Nature.
By constantly following the models is called the "Profound Virtues".
The Incomprehensive is unfathomable and far-reaching.
It (Change) brings all things to return (from the extreme) until perfect harmony - "Grand Concord" is reached.
