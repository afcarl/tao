Abandon learning, there will be no worry!
What is the real meaning between Yes and No?
What is the clear distinction between good and bad?
What all men fear, one has to fear.
Most people are busy, busy and never know where to stop.
Most people are happy-go-lucky, as though they are attending a great feast or as though they are ascending a tower for sight-seeing in spring time.
My desire has not yet even started, like an infant who has not yet become a child.
They are rushing and rushing, and never know where to rest.
Most people desire more;
I alone prefer less.
I am simple,
Pure and calm.
Most people feel bright, bright;
I alone seem to be dull.
Most people are searching, searching;
I alone keep quiet, quiet.
Like a calm ocean moving without end.
Most people feel that they have merits;
I alone feel myself useless and worthless.
I alone am different from others and still prefer to drink mother's milk.
