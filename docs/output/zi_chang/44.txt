Between your fame and yourself, which is closer to you?
Between yourself and your wealth, which is more dear to you?
Between gain and loss, which is more of a burden to you?
Thus, excessive lust will cost one a great deal in the end.
Excessive wealth will make one suffer a heavy loss.
One who knows satisfaction will not be disgraced.
One who knows when to stop will not reach a perilous end.
Then he can rule everywhere and forever.
