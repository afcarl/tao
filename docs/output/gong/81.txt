Truthful words are not beautiful.
Beautiful words are often not truthful.
Good man do not argue.

Those who know everything, do not know.
The sage never tries to store things up.
The more he does for others, the more he has.
The more he gives to others, the greater his abundance.
Tao of heaven benefits, not harms.
Tao of the sage is working without claiming.
