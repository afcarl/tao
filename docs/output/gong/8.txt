Highest good, like water.
Water provides to everything, yet not demanding.
It flows to lowly places (which is shunted by men), is like Tao.
Dwell, in good place.
Meditate, into the depth of the heart.
Be Jen.
Speak, trustworthily.
Rules, be just.
In business, be competent.
In action, be timely.
No argument. No blame.
