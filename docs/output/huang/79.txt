Reconciling a great hatred necessarily entails unsolved hatred.
How can this be kindful?
So the sage honors the left-hand tally but does not blame people.
Before the kind Action, hold onto the tally.
Before the kindless Action, hold onto the openness.
The Tao of heaven is impersonal.
It enhances those who are kind.
