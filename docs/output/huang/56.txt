Those who know, do not say.
Those who say, do not know.
Close the mouth.
Shut the door.
Merge into light.
As ordinary as dust.
Blunt the sharpness.
Unravel the entanglements.
This is called mysterious sameness.
You are not intimate by acquiring it;
You are not distant in not acquiring it.
You do not profit by acquiring it;
You do not lose it by not acquiring it.
You are not ennobled by acquiring it;
You are not disgraced by not acquiring it.
This enables the nobility of the world.
