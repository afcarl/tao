The world begins with the mother as its source.
When you have the mother, you know the son.
When you know the son, return to preserve the mother.
Although the body dies, there is no harm.
By closing your mouth and shutting the door, there would be no wearing down of life.
When opening the mouth and pursuing your affairs, life cannot be preserved.
Seeing what is small is discernment.
Preserving subtleness is strength.
Using the light enables one to return to discernment.
Without losing the center of the body is called penetrating the eternal.
