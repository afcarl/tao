Look for it and it can not be seen, it is called invisible;
Listen to it and it can not be heard, it is called inaudible;
Reach for it and it can not be touched, it is called intangible.
These three are beyond reckoning, so
When these three merge, they are One.
As for this One,
There is nothing above it remaining to be accounted for,
There is nothing below it that has been excluded.
Ever searching for it, it is beyond naming.
It returns to no-thing.
Its state is described as no state,
Its form is described as formless.
It is called the vision beyond focus.
Follow after it, and it proves endless.
Go before it, and no beginning can be found.
Employ the Tao of today in order to manage today's affairs and to know the ancient past.
This is called the principle of Tao.
