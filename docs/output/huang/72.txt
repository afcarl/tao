People are fearless before the power.
If fear arises, it will be a great fear.
Not constraining the living environment,
They do not get bored by life.
Because we do not get bored, there is no boredom.
Therefore the sage is self-aware but not introspective.
He has self-respect but does not price himself.
He rejects one and takes the other.
