Through discrimination, I have the knowledge to walk in the great Tao.
The only fear is what is other than that.
The great Tao is quite smooth, yet people prefer a short-cut.
The court is so busy legislating that the fields go uncultivated and granaries are all empty.
They wear the magnificent clothing, girdle the sharp swords.
They are gorged with food and possess many brides.
Their bounty suffices but they continue to steal.
This is opposite of Tao.
