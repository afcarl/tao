Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish.
If Tao is utilized to manage the society, its ghost will not become spirit.
Not that ghost is not spiritual, but that the spirit harms no people;
Not only does the spirit harm not the people, but that the sage is harmless.
As those two cause no harm, they are united in Action.
