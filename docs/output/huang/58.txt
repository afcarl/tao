When the government is silent, people are sincere.
When the government is intrusive, the state is decisive.
Disaster is what fortune depends upon,
Fortune is what disaster subdues.
Who knows a final outcome?
There is no right lawfulness.
Justice tends towards the extreme.
Kindness tends towards evil.
People have been familiar with this for a long time.
So,
Be rounded without cutting.
Be compatible without puncturing.
Be straightforward without trapping.
Be bright without dazzling.
