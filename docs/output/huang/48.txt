Having a zest for learning yields an increase day by day.
Hearing the Tao brings a loss day by day.
Losing more and more until inaction results.
Inaction results, yet everything is done.
Managing the world always involves nonengagement.
As soon as there is engagement, there is never enough of it to manage the world.
