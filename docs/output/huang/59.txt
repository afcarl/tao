For governing people and serving the heaven, nothing is better than frugality.
Only frugality enables the pre-empty measures.
Pre-empty measures mean a great accumulation of Action.
A great accumulation of Action leaves nothing to be conquered.
When nothing needs to be conquered,
No-boundary is known.
When no-boundary is known, it allows the country to exist.
The country, existing from its source, can endure.
This is the Tao of having a deep root, a strong stem, a long life, and an enduring vision.
