A small country has few people.
Weapons are far more numerous than the people, but they are not used.
Let people be serious about death and enjoy a long journey.
Though there are carriages and boats, they are not useful for travel.
Let people return to:
Use the technique of knotting the rope,
Enjoying the food,
Appreciating the cloth,
Delighting in customs,
Settling into their living conditions.
The neighboring countries are in sight.
The sounds of dogs and chickens are heard.
People grow old and die without interference from each other.
