A great nation flows downwardly, it is the mother of the world and the integration of the world.
The mother is always tranquil and overcomes the male by her tranquility, so she benefits the world.
A great nation relies on a low position to take over a small nation.
A small nation, being in a low position, is taken over by a great nation.
So being lower allows taking over or being taken over.
Being a great nation only desires to unify the people.
Being a small nation only seeks people's business.
They both get what they want, but the greater is being lower.
