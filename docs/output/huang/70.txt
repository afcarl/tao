My words are easy to understand and easy to apply.
Yet no one in the world can understand them and no one could apply them.
Words have their origin, and events have their leader.
Only because of prevailing ignorance am I not understood.
The fewer who understand me, the more precious I am.
So the sage wears shabby cloth, but holds a treasure within.
