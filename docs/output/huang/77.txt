The Tao of heaven is like drawing a bow.
The high bends down,
The low rises up.
The surplus decreases,
Insufficiency is supplied.
So the Tao of heaven reduces what is surplus and enhances what is insufficient.
The human Tao reduces what is insufficient and caters to the surplus.
Who can use the surplus to benefit the heaven?
Only those who possess Tao.
So the sage
Exists without ownership,
Accomplishes without holding on.
It is thus, without desire, that the wise see.
