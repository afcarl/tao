We live, we die.
The companions of life are three and ten.
The companions of death are three and ten.
That people live their active life necessarily leading to the ground of death is three and ten.
Why so?
It is the nature of life itself.
As a matter of fact, I hear of those who are good at preserving their lives:
Walking through, not avoiding rhinos and tigers.
Entering battle without wearing armaments.
The rhino has no place to dig its horns.
The tiger has no place to drag its claws.
The soldier has no place to thrust his blade.
Why is this so?
Because they have no place to die.
