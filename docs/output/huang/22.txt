Yield, and retain integrity.
In the depths of whirling, there is stillness.
The hollow enables the plentiful.
The old gives way to the new.
The small allows for increase.
Excess breeds confusion.
Therefore the sage holds oneness as the shepherd of the world.
He who does not display himself is seen.
He who does not justify himself is understood.
He who does not lash out succeeds.
He who does not build himself up endures.
Therefore,
Only the spirit of noncompetition makes things noncompetitive.
So the old saying, "yield, and retain integrity," is but a few words,
But when rightly understood, integrity returns.
