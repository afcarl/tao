When government is anarchic, the people are honest;
When government is meddlesome, the state is lacking.
Disaster is that whereon good fortune depends,
Good fortune is that wherein disaster lurks.
Who knows their limits?
When there is no uprightness, correct reverts to crafty, good reverts to gruesome.
The delusion of mankind,
How long have been its days!
For this reason, be
Square but not cutting,
Angular but not prickly,
Straight but not arrogant,
Bright but not dazzling.
