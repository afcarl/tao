"Abolish sagehood and abandon cunning, the people will benefit a hundredfold;
Abolish humaneness and abandon righteousness, the people will once again be filial and kind;
Abolish cleverness and abandon profit, bandits and thieves will be no more."
These three statements are inadequate as a civilizing doctrine;
Therefore,
Let something be added to them:
Evince the plainness of undyed silk,
Embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log;
Lessen selfishness,
Diminish desires;
Abolish learning
and you will be without worries.
