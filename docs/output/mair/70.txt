My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice.
But no one is able to understand them,
And no one is able to practice them.
Words have authority.
Affairs have an ancestry.
It is simply because of their ignorance, that they do not understand me;
Those who understand me are few, thus I am ennobled.
For this reason,
The sage wears coarse clothing over his shoulders, but carries jade within his bosom.
