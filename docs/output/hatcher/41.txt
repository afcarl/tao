Superior students, hearing of the way,
Are diligent and practice it
Average students, hearing of the way,
Sometimes attend & sometimes forget
Inferior students, hearing of the way,
Laugh greatly about it
Without the laughter there would be no grounds
to regard this as the way
And so the established proverbs hold that:
Brightness, to the way, is as good as darkness
Advance, to the way, is as good as retreat
Evenness, to the way, is as good as roughness
The summit of character is as good as a valley
The greatest whiteness is as good as soiled
Abundant character seems inadequate
Established character seems furtive
The evident truth seems spurious
The greatest square has no corner
The greatest capacity is last to be realized
The greatest note is the rarest sound
The greatest image has no form
The way is hidden & nameless
(But) because way is good at acceptance
(it is) also fulfilling
