The way gives things life
Character raises them
Existence shapes them
Conditions complete them
So it is that the myriad beings, without exception,
Ennoble the way and honor character
The way will be ennobled
Character will be honored
But nobody has to command this
as it always proceeds out of nature
In this way the way gives things life
Character raises them
Sustains them, brings them up
Shelters them, heals them
Nurtures them, protects them
Creates but does not possess
Acts but does not expect
Leads but does not rule
These may be called “mystic powers”
