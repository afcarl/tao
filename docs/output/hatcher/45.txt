A great achievement (may) seem deficient
But its function is not impaired
A great fulfillment (may) seem empty
But its function is not diminished
Great straightforwardness (might) seem compromised
Great artfulness (might) seem clumsy
Great eloquence (might) seem to stammer
Restlessness overcomes cold
Stillness overcomes heat
Clarity & stillness act as measures to the world
