Wise ones have no set mind
Regarding the hundred families’ minds as “mind”
To those who are good we have good to extend
To those who are less than good we also have good to extend
To merit goodness
To those who are true we have truth to extend
To those who are less than true we also have truth to extend
To merit truth
Wise ones are in the world
Uniting, connecting, adopting the world
Merging with their hearts
The hundred families, as one, pay heed,
with their “hearkening” & “beholding”
The wise ones, as one, come to laugh like children
