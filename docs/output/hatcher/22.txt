The yielding becomes whole
The bent becomes straight
The hollow becomes replenished
The worn becomes renewed
The diminished becomes endowed
The plentiful becomes doubtful
This is why wise ones embrace unity
Adopting nature as model
Without self-display
And thus clear
Without self-righteousness
And thus distinguished
Without self-assertion
And thus having merit
Without self-glorification
And thus enduring
It is only when there is no contending
That none in the world can contend against them
The ancient ones had reasons to claim
“The accommodating becomes whole”
Is this (just) empty talk now?
(When) wholeness is real then one has come home
