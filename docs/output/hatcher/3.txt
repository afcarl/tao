Not exalting worthies
Keeps the people from rivalry
Not prizing goods which are hard to obtain
Keeps the people from acting like thieves
Not displaying the desirable
Keeps the peoplesâ€™ hearts from confusion
This is how wise ones approach government
Emptying the hearts
(And) filling the bellies
Weakening the ambitions
(And) strengthening the bones
Always keeping the people free of sophistication, free of desires
So that even the clever ones will not presume to meddle at all
(Where) action does not take action
There nothing is out of order
