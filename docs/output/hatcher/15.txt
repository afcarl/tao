The ancients who had skill at practicing the way
Were subtle & mysterious, profound & penetrating
A depth not easy to fathom
Inasmuch as they were not easy to fathom
It is thus an effort to construct their appearance
So ready-
As if fording a stream in winter
So vigilant-
As if wary of (all) four neighbors
So dignified-
As though they were guests
So relenting-
Like ice which is about to melt
So artless-
As though they were of unworked wood
So expansive-
As though they were watersheds
So intermingled-
As though they were turbid streams
Who is able, (as) a turbid stream, to become still
and arrive by degrees at clarity?
Who is able, at peace, to become energetic
and arrive by degrees at vitality?
Whoever preserves this path
Not longing for more than fullness
Only those not overfull
Can then stay obscure
and not begin to be finished
