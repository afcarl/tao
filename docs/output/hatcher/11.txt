Thirty spokes converge in one hub
Then depending upon what does not exist
is the vehicle’s usefulness
Mold clay in order to produce a vessel
Then depending upon what does not exist
is the vessel’s usefulness
Cut out doors and windows in order to make a dwelling
Then depending upon what does not exist
is the dwelling’s usefulness
Thus, the existence of something serves to make value
The lack of something serves to make utility
