The five colors will make the human eye blind
The five tones will make the human ear deaf
The five flavors will make the human palate jaded
Racing for speed and hunting for sport
Will make the human heart go mad
Goods which are hard to obtain
Will bring human progress obstruction
This is why wise ones
Regard the belly instead of regarding the sight
And so dismiss That to choose This
