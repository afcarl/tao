The way is continuous, without description
The original nature may be ordinary
But none in the world presumes to master it all
If leaders & sovereigns were able to grasp this
The myriad beings would then submit naturally
(As) heaven and earth join together
Thus to let fall the sweet dew
Nobody has commanded this,
yet the harmony is natural
Begin with rules & definitions appear
And still more definitions are already assumed
Now, more than ever, prepare to learn restraint
Learning restraint is apt to be useful in avoiding trouble
Imagine the place of the path in nature
To be like the streams and valleys
reaching for rivers and ocean
