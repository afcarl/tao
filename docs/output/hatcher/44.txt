Reputation compared to life, which is dearer?
Life compared to property, which is (worth) more?
Gain compared to loss, which is (more) distressing?
It is a given that extreme affection
Entails great cost
Much stored up entails heavy loss
To understand sufficiency is no disgrace
To understand restraint avoids limits -
(This is) the right way to live long
