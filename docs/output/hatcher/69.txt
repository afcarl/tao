Military strategists have a saying:
“I will not dare to act as host,
But rather, act as guest,
Will not presume to advance an inch,
But rather, retreat a foot”
This may be called “to move without movement,
To roll up sleeves without baring arms,
To depose without a fight
To capture without force”
There is no danger greater than underestimating a foe
Underestimate a foe will risk losing what we value
And so when opposing forces meet each other
The one sympathetic will truly succeed
