Heaven is eternal, earth endures
The reason why heaven & earth can continue and endure
is this:
That their lives are not their own
In this way (they) can go on living
This is why wise ones put themselves last
And yet (their) being advances
Exclude themselves
And yet (their) being persists
Is it not because they have no self-interest?
Thus (they) can fulfill their self-interests
