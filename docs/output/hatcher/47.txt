Without going out the door
Comprehend (all) under heaven
Without peering out the window
Observe the way of heaven
The farther beyond one goes
Oneâ€™s comprehension is by that much diminished
This is why wise ones (might) not move about, but still know
(Might) not witness, but still describe
(Might) not act, but still accomplish
