How the great way (is a) flood!
It is apt to go (both) left & right
The myriad beings trust this for life,
yet there are no explanations
The work is completed, in spite of distinctions & claims
The myriad beings are clothed & cared for
yet there is no assumption of leadership
Ever dispassionate, (it) invites a reputation for commonness
(But) the myriad beings return here,
and still there is no acting as master
Inviting a reputation for greatness
Because it never regards itself as great
So it is able to establish its greatness
