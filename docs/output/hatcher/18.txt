(Where) the great path is abandoned
There appear benevolence & righteousness
(When) the learned & clever emerge
There appear great hypocrisies
(When) the six bonds of kinship are out of balance
There appear filial piety and parental affection
(When) countries & clans are in darkness & turmoil
There appear loyalty & public service
