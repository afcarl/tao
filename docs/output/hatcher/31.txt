Even the finest weapons are tools of ill omen
Things somehow wrong to hold
So those who have the way do not linger
A noble one, when home, honors the left
When working with weapons, honors the right
Weapons are tools of ill omen
They are not a noble one’s tools
Failing to gain satisfaction and still using them
Calm indifference is best adopted
Even in triumph there is no beauty
And those who are attracted to this
are in fact delighting in the slaughter of others
Now those who delight in the slaughter of others
Are then ill suited for use
in achieving any goal in the world at all
(In) auspicious affairs the left side is honored
(In) adverse affairs the right side is honored
An army’s lieutenant commander stays to the left
The army’s commander in chief stays to the right
A description of the funeral rites held at the end
Where the slaughter of others amounts to a multitude
Have compassion & lament & weep for them
(When) the battle is won
consider the funeral rites being held here
