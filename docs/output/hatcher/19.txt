Cut out sanctimony, repudiate cleverness
The people will profit a hundred times over
Cut out benevolence, abandon righteousness
The people return to filial piety & parental affection
Cut out artfulness, abandon rewards
(Then) robbers and thieves have nothing to gain
These three may help to improve the culture
but (they) are not a foundation
So let there be purpose to build on:
Look to the ordinary & embrace original nature
Diminish self-interest & have fewer desires
