Looking for things not seen
Descriptions will tell of “the invisible”
Listening for things not heard
Descriptions will tell of “the inaudible”
Reaching for things not grasped
Descriptions will tell of “the intangible”
These three do not allow complete investigation
And so are confused and considered as one
What height is not bright
What depth is not dark
An unbroken continuity does not permit description -
A return home to non existence
And so this is called the form of the formless
The image of nothingness
It is called elusive & obscure
When it is met its head is not seen
When it is followed its end is not seen
To grasp the path of the ancients
Is the way to master present existence
The capacity to comprehend the ancient beginnings
May be called the clue* to the way
