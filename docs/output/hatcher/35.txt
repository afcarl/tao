Grasp the big picture
(All) under heaven make progress
Make progress while doing no harm
Security and peace abound
(For) music along with fine food
The passing stranger will linger
(But) the way, as expressed in words
How insipid! It has no flavor
Look at it, there is nothing to satisfy the sight
Listen for it, there is nothing to satisfy the hearing
(But) use it, is not about to be used up
