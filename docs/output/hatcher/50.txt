Emerging in life (or) entering death
The companions of life will be three (in) ten
The companions of death will be three (in) ten
And others whose lives & actions approach the domain of death
Will also be three (in) ten
Now why is this so?
Because these live life for its substance
Now hear of the one adept at sustaining life
Traveling the countryside, not meeting buffalo or tiger
Entering a battle, not carrying armor or weapons -
The buffalo finds no place to thrust its horns
The tiger finds no place to sink its claws
The weapon finds no place to admit its blade
Now why is this so?
Because in this one there is no place for death
