These things, from the beginning, have grasped wholeness:
Heaven attained the whole, becoming resolved
Earth attained the whole, becoming steady
Spirit attained the whole, becoming subtle
The valley attained the whole, becoming replenished
The myriad beings attained the whole, coming to life
Leaders & sovereigns attained the whole
as the way to attend to (all) under heaven
These things found it
Heaven, with no way to resolution,
would threaten to split apart
Earth, with no way to steadiness,
would threaten to open up
Spirit, with no way to subtlety
would probably perish
The valleys, with no way to replenishment,
would likely dry up
The myriad beings, with no way to life,
would likely be extinguished
Leaders and sovereigns,
with no way to dignity & prominence
would likely be toppled
In this way dignity regards the common as root
Prominence regards the humble as basis
This is why leaders & sovereigns refer to themselves
as orphaned & friendless, without worth
Does this not regard the common as root?
Not so?
Just as obtaining tallies of chariots
will not be (real) chariots
Do not long to dazzle & jingle like jade
Clunk & clatter like rocks
