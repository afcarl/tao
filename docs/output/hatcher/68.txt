The student skilled at action is not aggressive
The one skilled at combat is not angry
The one at besting opponents does not participate
The one skilled at employing others behaves as their subordinate
This may be styled the “virtue of not contending”
It may be styled “applying another’s power”
It may be styled “siding with heaven,”
The consummation of antiquity
