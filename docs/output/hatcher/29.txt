When taken by desire to take hold of nature
and reconstruct things
We notice that this (will) never reach closure
The world is a spirit vessel
Not suited to reconstruction at all
Those who interfere spoil things
Those who grab lose things
And so the beings sometimes go ahead, sometimes follow
Sometimes snort, sometimes puff
Sometimes are fit, sometimes are feeble
Sometimes hold up, sometimes break down
This is why wise ones avoid the extremes
Avoid the superfluous
Avoid the extravagant
