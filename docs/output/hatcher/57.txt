Use principle to govern a country
Use tricks to wage a war
Use the least effort to capture the world
By what means do we know that things are really like this?
By This
There are more taboos & restrictions in the world
But the people grow more impoverished
The people have more productive implements
(But) countries & clans grow more disturbed
(As) others get more clever & artful
Bizarre things happen more often
The more that matters of law are proclaimed
The more robbers & looters there will be
And so the wise ones will claim:
We do nothing
And humanity evolves on its own
We favor stillness
And humanity governs itself
We do not make an effort
And humanity enriches itself
We have no ambition
And humanity simplifies itself
