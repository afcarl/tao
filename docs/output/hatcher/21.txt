The bearing of true character
Is simply to follow a true path
If the way is regarded as an entity
It is only elusive, only vague
So vague & so elusive
(Yet) at its center there is shape
So elusive & so vague
(Yet) at its center there are beings
So arcane & so shadowy
(Yet) at its center there is seed
This seed is profoundly real
At its center there is truth
From the present back into antiquity
Its meaning does not fade
Through this is seen a common ancestry
How do we know that the common ancestryâ€™s shape is thus?
