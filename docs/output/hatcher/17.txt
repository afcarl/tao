Great leaders’ subordinates know of their existence
Those next in order are loved and praised by them
Those next in order are feared by them
Those next in order are despised by them
If trust lacks basis here
There will be no trust here
So step back- there is value to words
Complete the task, follow through in the work
The hundred families all will declare
“(It was) our natural course!”
