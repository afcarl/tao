Know the masculine
(But) keep the feminine
Serve as a stream to the world
Serving as stream to the world
Consistent character will not depart
(But) return home again as the newborn child
Know the bright
(But) keep the dark
Serve as a model to the world
Serving as model to the world
Consistent character will not falter
(But) return home again as unlimited
Know the honored
(But) keep the humble
Serve as a valley to the world
Serving as valley to the world
Consistent character will then be enough
A return journey home to original nature
Original nature, cut up, is then made into artifacts
Wise ones, using such things,
Are then made into senior officials
And so the greatest governing does the least dividing
