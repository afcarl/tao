To embody virtue’s substance
Compares to the naked infant
Wasps & scorpions, vipers & serpents do not bite
Wild beasts do not seize
Birds of prey do not strike
The bones are flexible, the muscles are soft,
but the grip is sure
Not yet knowing the union of woman & man
But the penis is aroused
Essence is at its prime here!
Howling all day, but not getting hoarse
Harmony is at its prime here!
To comprehend harmony speaks of the continuous
To comprehend the continuous speaks of clarity
The enrichment of life may be called a “happy omen”
The mind directing the breath may be called a “power”
(But) beings grown mighty will then grow frail
This may be called “off the path”
Off the path is soon finished
