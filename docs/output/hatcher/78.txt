(In all) the world there is nothing
as adaptable & soft as water
Yet of that which attacks the hard & inflexible
Nothing can surpass it
Because there is no way easier than this
The gentle finally overcomes the firm
The adaptable finally overcomes the persistent
There is no one under heaven
who cannot comprehend (this)
(But) no one can practice (it)
So it is that wise ones maintain:
To accept the country’s soil
May in truth be called mastering the altars of place & grain
To accept the realm’s misfortunes
Is in truth to serve as sovereign to the world
Straightforward words may seem turned around
