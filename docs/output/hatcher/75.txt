The hunger of the people
Is from their superiors eating up so much of their tax grain
This is behind the hunger
The difficulties in governing the people
Are due to their superiors having to take action
This is behind the difficulties in government
The people come to take death lightly
Because they pursue lifeâ€™s riches
This is behind their taking death lightly
Only when one does not think life a performance
Will there be skill in valuing life
