When desiring to contract a thing
First be sure to expand it
When desiring to weaken a thing
First be sure to empower it
When desiring to abolish a thing
First be sure to promote it
When desiring to despoil a thing
First be sure to endow it
This may be called “subtle discernment”
The adaptable & gentle overcome the firm & strong
Fish should not be removed from the depths
The sharpest instruments of the state
Should not be for showing to others
