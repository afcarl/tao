(In) governing people (or) serving heaven
There is nothing quite like economy
Only one who is thrifty
May be deemed ahead of the task
To be ahead of the task suggests there is
a great reserve of character
Given a great reserve of character
then nothing is impossible
When nothing is impossible
then nobody knows things to be limited
Nobody knowing things to be limited
is fit to claim the realm
(Now) claiming the realmâ€™s mother
is fitness to endure a long time
This describes deep roots & solid foundations
The path of long life & enduring vision
