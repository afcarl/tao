Cut out the academics & avoid the anxieties
The (ready) yes, alongside the (obsequious) yea
What is the distance or nearness between them?
(Even) the good, next to the bad,
What is the difference or likeness between them?
(That) that which the others hold in awe
Will not permit less than awe -
What nonsense! There will never be an end to this, ever!
Everyone (else) is resplendent & festive
As if feasting on great sacrifices
As if in springtime & climbing up towers
I alone am unmoved here, one yet to give a sign
Like a newborn infant, one yet to smile
So worn & weary, as one with no home to come home to
Everyone (else) takes more than enough
While I alone seem forsaken
With only my simpleton’s mind!
So muddled & confused
The common folk are bright & sunny
I alone am in chaos & gloom
The common folk are alert & sharp
I alone am torpid & blunt
So placid- in this like the sea
So restless a wind- as if never to stop
Everyone else has purpose
While I alone am wayward, like a rustic
I alone am other than the others
Still enjoying mother’s meals
