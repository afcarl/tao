Ruling a great country is like cooking a little fish
This is how the way manages (all) under heaven
(Whether) the ghosts lack spirit
Or the ghosts do not lack spirit
(Whether) the spirits avoid harming people
Or the spirits do not avoid harming people
Wise ones still avoid harming people
Now as neither of these haunts the other
So virtue interacts & comes back home to them
