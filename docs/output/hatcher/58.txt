(Where) their government is muted & dull
Its people are honest & sincere
(Where) their government is efficient & exacting
Its people are partial & wanting
Ah, suffering! That happiness has such things to rely on!
Ah, happiness! That suffering has such places to lurk!
Who comprehends their outcomes?
Are there no rules?
The rules go back to behaving strangely
The good return to acting ominously
Humankind has held its delusions
For such an entrenched length of days
This is why wise ones
Are direct but not divisive
Exacting but not hurtful
To the point but not tactless
Bright but not dazzling
