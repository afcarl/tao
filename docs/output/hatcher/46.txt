When the world holds to the way
Retired racehorses are useful for manure
When the world loses the way
War horses breed throughout the frontier
There is no vice greater than submitting to greed
No suffering greater than never knowing sufficiency
No error greater than the hunger for gain
So to know that sufficiency is in itself sufficient
Is a truly durable sufficiency
