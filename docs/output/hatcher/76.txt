People, while they live, are adaptable & soft
When they are dead, are hard & stiff
The myriad beings, the plants and the trees,
while they live, are supple & delicate
When they are dead, are weathered & tough
And so the hard & inflexible are companions to death
The adaptable & soft are companions to life
This is why the unbending military will not,
in due course, be triumphant
The rigid tree is then struck down
The strong & great belong underneath
The adaptable & soft belong above
