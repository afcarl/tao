The highest good is like water
Waterâ€™s goodness benefits the myriad beings
And yet does not strive
Dwells in places which everyone else regards with contempt
And in this way is close to the way
In dwelling the good is place
In mind the good is depth
In relations the good is compassion
In speech the good is sincerity
In government the good is organization
In business the good is competence
In movement the good is timing
It is only when there is no contention
That there then is no resentment
