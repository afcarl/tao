The heavy serves as root to the light
Stillness serves as master to haste
And so it is that a noble one journeys all day
Without leaving the heavy supply wagon,
Although there are splendid vistas,
Calmly staying above it all
So how could the lord of a myriad chariots
Also conduct a frivolous life under heaven?
To be frivolous, would then be to lose the root
To be hasty would then be to lose the mastery
