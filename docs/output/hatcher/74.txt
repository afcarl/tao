(If) the people do not fear death
Then why use death to intimidate them?
Suppose it were so that the people always feared death
And still they behaved perversely
(When) we seized, detained and executed them
Who would be bold?
There will always be a master executioner to do the killing
Now to take the place of the master executioner
& do the killing
May be likened to taking the place of the master carpenter
in hewing
Now (of) those who take the place of the master carpenter
in hewing
Few indeed will not harm their own hands!
