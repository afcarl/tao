All under heaven know the beauty of things as beauty
So ugliness is already there
All know the good of things as the good
So the not-good is already there
And so being and nothingness beget each other
Difficult & easy complete each other
Lasting & brief define each other
High & low rely on each other
Tone & voice resonate with each other
Before & after follow each other
This is how wise ones abide without interfering with the work,
Practice without speaking their doctrine
A myriad beings emerge here, but without explanation
Are produced, but with no claims
Are developed, but with no expectations
Works are accomplished, but with no dwelling
Insofar as there is no dwelling
This means there is no departure
