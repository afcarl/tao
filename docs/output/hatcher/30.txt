Those who use the way to help with human government
Do not use arms (or) force on the world
Such efforts tend to recoil
(In) a place where an army has camped
Thorns and brambles grow now
A great army’s aftermath is sure to bring bad harvests
Those who are competent succeed and then stop
Not daring (or) thinking to take by force
Succeed but do not glorify
Succeed but with no aggression
Succeed but with no arrogance
Succeed even not having gained the end
Succeed but do not dominate
A being grown mighty will then grow frail
This may be called “off the path”
Off the path is soon finished
