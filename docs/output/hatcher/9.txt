To maintain but then overdo something
Is not as good as one’s showing restraint
To rough out but then (over)hone something
Does not help hold (the edge) long
(When) coins and jade fill the hall
Nobody can defend this
(Being) wealthy & honored and then being proud
The natural consequence is one’s own misfortune
(When) the work succeeds a body retires
Keeping to heaven’s path
