Sparing are the speeches from nature
So the whirling winds do not last morning
The storming rains do not last all day
What is it producing these?
Heaven and earth
(If) even heaven and earth are unable to persist
Then compare this (case) with humanity!
And so to attend to affairs of the path:
The path means an identity with the path
Character means an identity with character
Failure means an identity with failure
For those who identify with the path
The path, in turn, readily* accepts them
For those who identify with character
Character, in turn, readily accepts them
For those who identify with failure
Failure, in turn, readily accepts them
If truth has no basis here
There will be no truth here
