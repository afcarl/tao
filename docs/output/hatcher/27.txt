The able wanderer leaves no trail (or) trace
The able speaker is without fallacy (or) error
The able reckoner does not use counting devices
The best closure uses no barrier (or) bar
And yet is not easily opened
The best binding uses no cord (or) knot
And yet is not easily loosened
And so it is that wise ones
Are ever so skilled at making the most of others
That no person is forsaken
Are ever so skilled at making the most of situations
That no situation is wasted
This may be called “practical wisdom”
And so the able one is the less than able one’s teacher
The less than able one is the able one’s resource
To not value one’s teacher, to not care for one’s resource,
However “prudent” is greatly deluded
This may be called a “tactical mystery”
