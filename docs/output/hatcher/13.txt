Favor & disgrace are equally frightening
Exaltation and big trouble are the same as oneself
Why say that favor & disgrace are equally frightening
Favor sets up a downfall
To get it is the same as a warning
To lose it is the same as a warning
Which says that favor & disgrace are equally frightening
Why say that exaltation and big trouble
are the same as oneself?
This is the reason that we have big troubles:
Assuming that we are selves
As long as we are not selves
What troubles do we have?
And so, to respect & regard as oneself
the workings of the world
Is the same as deserving to inhabit the world
To love & regard as oneself
the workings of the world
Is the same as deserving to be steward to the world
