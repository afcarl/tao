The world had a beginning
Regarded as mother to the world
Having found this mother
Through this comprehend her children
Having comprehended her children
Return & attend to the mother
The death of self is nothing to fear
Close the passages
Secure the gates
(And) the rest of life is no trouble
Open the passages
Conclude the affairs
(And) the rest of life finds no salvation
To perceive in detail tells of clarity
To maintain flexibility tells of strength
Make use of what is illuminated
To return home again to the light
Do not abandon yourself to misfortune
This may be called “sustainable practice”
