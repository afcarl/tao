The way always takes no action
Yet nothing remains undone
If leaders & sovereigns were able to grasp this
The myriad beings would evolve by themselves
Evolve and then want to flourish
We can then temper this
with the original nature of namelessness
(With) the original nature of namelessness
Then these too would be without ambition
Being free of ambition is the way to stillness
Nature will then arrange itself
