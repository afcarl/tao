There was a thing disordered but complete
Before Heaven and Earth were born.
Tranquil… empty… alone standing unchanging.
Swirling and not tiring.

It can be considered as being to the world a mother.
I do not know its name.
Forced to verbalize it, I call it “Tao.”
Forced to describe it, I call it “Great.”

Great, it is said to leave.
Leaving, it is said to be distant.
Distant, it is said to return.

Therefore, the Tao is great.
Heaven is great.
The Earth is great.
Humankind is also great.

In the middle realm, there are four greatnesses
And humankind then dwells in this Completeness:

Humankind is ruled by the Earth
The Earth is ruled by Heaven
Heaven is ruled by the Tao
The Tao is ruled by its own nature.
