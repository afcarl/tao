[After] pacifying great hatred
Surely there exists remaining resentment.
How can [this] be considered good?

Therefore, the sages keep the left side [of an] agreement
And do not demand [the right side] from people.
Having virtue, [one] manages an agreement.
Lacking virtue, [one] manages to deprive.

The Heavenly Tao is not personal.
[It] always give[s] kindly to people.
