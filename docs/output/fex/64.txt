The stabilized is easy to grasp.
The not-yet-begun is easy to plan for.
The brittle is easy to break.
The tiny is easy to scatter.

Act upon it while it does not yet exist.
Govern it while it is not yet chaotic.

The tree [as thick as] joined arms embraced
Comes into existence at an insignificant height.
The platform of nine stories is built by piling up dirt.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with a [single] step.

Those who contrive, ruin them.
Those who grasp, lose them.

Therefore, the sages
Do not contrive and therefore do not ruin.
Do not grasp and therefore do not lose.

The undertakings of the people:
[They see] matters frequently [through] to near-completion
But ruin them [toward the end].
Act with care in the end just as in the beginning
[And you] will not ruin the matter.

Therefore, the sages
Desire not to desire
And do not value goods that are hard to get.
Learning “un-learning”
They return to the place the masses of people have [all] passed by.
Therefore, they assist the true natures of the ten-thousand things

And do not dare to contrive.
