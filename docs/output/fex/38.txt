High virtue is not a virtue; therefore, it exists as virtue.
Low virtue does not lose virtue; therefore, it is not [yet high] virtue.

High virtue is uncontrived
And is not done by means of [conscious] doing.
Low virtue is [also] uncontrived
But it occurs by means of [conscious] doing.

High benevolence contrives these
But is not done by means of [conscious] doing.
High righteousness [then] contrives that [i.e., high benevolence]
And it occurs by means of [conscious] doing.
High etiquette [then] contrives that [i.e., high righteousness]
And [when people] do not consider it to be a “must”
[It] then grabs [them by] the arms and casts them out.

Therefore:
Lose Tao, and afterwards comes virtue.
Lose virtue, and afterwards comes benevolence.
Lose benevolence, and afterwards comes righteousness.
Lose righteousness, and afterwards comes etiquette.

Those who [act only by] etiquette
Are the thin shell of loyalty and sincerity and the leaders of chaos.
Those who are prescient
Are flowers of the Tao but also the initiators of folly.

Therefore, great people
Live in the thick and do not dwell in the thin.
Live in the real and do not dwell in the flowers.

This is the reason they let go of those
And receive these.
