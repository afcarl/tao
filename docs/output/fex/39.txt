Those which of old obtained the One:

Heaven obtained the One and thus clarity.
Earth obtained the One and thus repose.
Spirits obtained the One and thus animation.
Waterways obtained the One and thus fullness.
The ten-thousand things obtained the One and thus livelihood.
Lords and kings obtained the One and thus became dedicated to the world.

This conveys it:

Heaven, without means of clarity, would fearfully split open.
Earth, without means of repose, would fearfully be terminated.
Spirits, without means of animation, would fearfully come to an end.
Waterways, without means of fullness, would fearfully be used up.
The ten-thousand things, without means of livelihood, would fearfully die
away.
Lords and kings, without means of dedication, would fearfully stumble and
fall.

This is the reason nobility therefore takes lowliness as the root.
The high therefore takes the low as the foundation.

Therefore, the lords and kings called themselves
“Orphaned,” “bereft,” and “unfortunate.”
Isn’t this “taking lowliness as the root” considered wrong?
Not at all!
The utmost honor is not renowned.

Do not desire jade-like stones as if [they were truly] jade.

Jade beads are like rocks.
