The great Tao is a flood!
It can [go] left and right.

The ten-thousand things rely upon it for their livelihood
And it does not refuse them.
It achieves and accomplishes but has no prestige.

It clothes and rears the ten-thousand things
But does not act as lord [over them].
Always without desire, it can then be named “With the Lowly.”

The ten-thousand things return there
And it does not act as lord [over them].
It can be named “Being Great.”

Because it at no time takes itself to be great
Is the reason it can achieve its greatness.
