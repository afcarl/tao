There is nothing in the world as flexible and weak as water.
And [among] those things that work at the firm and the strong
There is nothing that can surpass it [in this]
For it is without means [for the hard and strong] to alter it.

The victory of the weak over the strong
The victory of the flexible over the firm
There are none in the world who do not know [of these].
None who cannot practice [them].

Therefore do the sages say:
“Accepting the filth of the kingdom—
This is called taking charge of the gods of soil and the gods of grain.
To accept the banes of the kingdom—
This is to become the ruler of the world.”

Correct sayings seem contradictory.
