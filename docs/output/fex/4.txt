The Tao washes away and drinks them, possibly never getting full.
An abyss… it seems to be the ancestor of the ten-thousand things

Blunting their sharpness
Loosening their tangles
Harmonizing their lights
Equating their dust

Deep… it seems as though possibly alive.
The child of I-don’t-know-who.

It shaped the foremost among the gods.
