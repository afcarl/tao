Containing the substantiality of virtue
Is comparable to [being like] a bare child:
Poisonous insects do not sting [you].
Savage beasts do not seize [you].
Snatching birds do not take [you].

[The child’s] bones are tender
Its muscles are soft.
But its grip is firm.

It does not yet know the union of female and male
And yet it’s completely made:
The utmost of vitality indeed!

Throughout the day crying and not becoming hoarse:
The utmost of harmony indeed!

Knowing harmony is called the Constant.
Knowing the Constant is called clarity.
Promoting life is said to be auspicious.
The mind ordering ch’i is said to be violent.

A strong thing ruling over what is Old—
This is called “non-Tao.”

The non-Tao soon ends.
