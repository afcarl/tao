The highest superiors—
People below them [merely] know they have them.
The next highest—people below them love and praise them.
The next highest—people below them fear them.
The next highest—people below them insult them.

Where trust is insufficient
There is distrust.

So gentle, [the sage] values their words.
[And so when] their achievements are completed
And their work is successful
The hundred clans all proclaim
“We are naturally like this!”
