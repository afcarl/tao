The Tao is always without renown.
Although it is “simple” and “small”
The world is altogether unable to subjugate it.

Lords and kings, if they could maintain it—
The ten-thousand things would submit themselves.
Heaven and Earth with each other would combine
Thereby raining down sweet dew.

No humans command them, and they are naturally equitable.

At the beginning establishment, there existed names.
Names also since then existed.
One should also know [when] to stop [naming].
Knowing [when] to stop, one can thereby be in no danger.

Simile:
The living presence of the Tao in the world
Is like unto valley streams
Going into larger rivers
And the sea.
