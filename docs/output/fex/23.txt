Sparse speech is by nature.
Therefore, whirling winds do not last the morning.
Sudden rain does not last the day.
Who are they who do this? Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth are not able to [make it] last—
And [what are] people
Compared to [them]?

Therefore, those who manage affairs with the Tao
Are together with the Tao.
Those who are virtuous are together with Virtue.
Those who err are together with error.

Those who are with the Tao—the Tao is likewise glad to gain them.
Those who are with Virtue—Virtue is likewise glad to gain them.
Those who are with error—
Error—alas!—is glad to gain them.

Where belief is insufficient
There exists disbelief.
