High scholars hear of the Tao attentively and practice it.
Middling scholars hear of the Tao—
They seem to keep it [sometimes], seem to lose it [at other times].
Low scholars hear of the Tao—
They greatly deride it.

Not deriding is not sufficient to be the Tao.
This is the reason that [among the] established sayings there are these:

“The clear Tao seems obscure.”
“Making progress in the Tao seems like going backwards.”
“The smooth Tao seems flawed.”
“Superior virtue seems like a hollow.”
“Great purity seems like dishonor.”
“Extensive virtue seems insufficient.”
“Building virtue seems like whiling away without purpose.”
“True qualities seem to change.”

“A great region is without corners.”
“A great instrument is completed toward the end.”
“Great sound is rarely made known.”
“Great shape is without form.”

The Tao is hidden.
Nameless.

But only the Tao is good at pardoning and completing.
