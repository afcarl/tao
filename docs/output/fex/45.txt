Great completion seems incomplete.
Its use is not worn-out.
Great fullness seems empty.
Its use is not exhausted.

Great straightness seems bent.
Great skill seems clumsy.
Great argumentation seems slow of speech.

Stillness overcomes restlessness.
Coldness overcomes heat.

Clear and still, become for the world what is correct.
