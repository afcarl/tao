[When] the government is toned down and uninterested
The people are honest and unsophisticated.
[When] the government is scrutinizing and clinical:
The people lack and run short.

Misfortune still depends on that which is of good fortune.
Good fortune still conceals that which is of misfortune.
Who knows the final end [of this]?

[Even] this is not correct.

Correctness reverts to being strange.
Goodness reverts to being evil.
Peoples’ bewilderment—
Its days certainly have lasted a long time.

Therefore, the sages
Square but do not cut.
Inspect but do not stab.

Are straightforward but not unrestrained.

Luminous but not dazzling.
