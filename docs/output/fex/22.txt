Crookedness follows perfection.
Bending follows straightness.
Emptiness follows fullness.
Brokenness follows newness.
Lack follows gain.
Excess follows confusion.

Therefore, the sages embrace the One
Becoming examples for the world:

They do not show themselves, and so are radiant.
Do not affirm themselves, and so are made known.
Do not brag about themselves, and so have merit.
Do not throw their weight around, and so are leaders.

Precisely because they do not contend
Is the reason the world cannot contend with them.

That which is said of old:
“That which is crooked follows perfection”—
How can it be an empty saying?

Truly perfect and return to it.
