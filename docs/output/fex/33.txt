Those who understand people are wise.
Those who understand themselves are luminous.
Those who triumph over people have forcefulness.
Those who triumph over themselves have strength.
Those who know sufficiency are rich.
Those who work vigorously have determination.

That which does not lose its place lasts long.
That which dies but does not perish lives long.
