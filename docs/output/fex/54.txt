That which is well established is not rooted up.
That which is well embraced does not slip away.
Children and grandchildren, using honorary rites
Offer sacrifices unceasingly.

Cultivate it in the body—it’s virtue shall be Genuineness.
Cultivate it in the family—it’s virtue shall be [Having] Surplus.
Cultivate it in the village—it’s virtue shall be Endurance.
Cultivate it in the nation—it’s virtue shall be Abundance.
Cultivate it in the world—it’s virtue shall be Universality.

Therefore:
By means of the body, watch the body.
By means of the family, watch the family.
By means of the village, watch the village.
By means of the nation, watch the nation.
By means of the world, watch the world.

By what means do I know the world aright?

By this.
