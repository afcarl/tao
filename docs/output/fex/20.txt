Get rid of erudition; do not fret.
The saying of “yes” or “indubitably”—
They are removed from each other by how much?
In what way?

The imparting of “good” or “evil”—
In what way do they seem to differ from each other?

But that which the people fear
Is not suited to be disrespected.

Wild indeed, those not yet centered!
The masses of people are boisterous and exuberant
As if enjoying the greatest sacrificial feast.
As if in Spring, climbing onto the lookouts.
I alone am tranquil and quiet indeed, not yet showing these signs—
Like an infant babying those who are not yet children.

Weary, weary, as if no place to belong to!
The masses of people all have surplus
And I alone seem to be missing something.

Mine is the heart of a fool, besides!

Turbid and chaotic indeed, the ordinary people, bright and eminent!
I alone am muddled and confused.
Ordinary people study, survey, and scrutinize.
I alone am bored and uninterested.
The masses of people all have instrumentality
But I alone am both ignorant and lowly.
I alone differ from people

And value the nourishing Mother.
