The Tao is always not “doing”
And yet nothing is not done.

Lords and kings, if they could maintain it—
The ten-thousand things would transform themselves.
Transformed, [should] they yet desire to “act”
I would cool them with the simplicity of the Nameless.

The simplicity of the Nameless
A man would also not desire.

[By] not desiring [and] by means of stillness
The world shall stabilize itself.
