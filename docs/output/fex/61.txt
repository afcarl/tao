That kingdom that is great
Is modest and flowing:
The intersection of the world.
The female of the world.

The female, always by means of gentleness, overcomes the male.
Therefore, [being] gentle is being modest.

Therefore:
The great kingdom, by means of modesty [toward] the small kingdom
Receives the small kingdom.
The small kingdom, by means of modesty [toward] the great kingdom
Receives the great kingdom.

Therefore:
Some are modest in order to receive.
Some are modest and are received.

The great kingdom does not inordinately desire
To annex livestock and people.
The small kingdom does not inordinately desire
To come into the service of people.

[So that] they both get what each one desires
That which is the great [kingdom] should become modest.
