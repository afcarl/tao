My words are very easy to understand.
Very easy to practice.
There are none in the world who can understand [them].
None who can practice [them].

Words have an ancestor.
Affairs have a sovereign.

Precisely because one does not understand [this]
Is the reason one does not understand me.

Those who understand me are rare.
Those who follow me are prized.

Therefore, the sages
Are covered in coarse cloth
[But carry in their] bosoms a jewel.
