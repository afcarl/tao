Produced by birth, entering into death:

The disciples of life are three out of ten.
The disciples of death are three out of ten.
The lives of people
That move them toward a death on the earth:
[Of these] are there also three out of ten.

Why?
Because of their living the thickness of life.

But hear of those [one in ten] who are good at negotiating life:
Traveling by land, they do not encounter the cruel or the fierce.
Entering into an army, they are not covered with armor or weapons.
The cruel have no place to thrust their spear-tips
The fierce have no place to use their claws
Soldiers find no place to receive their blades.

Why?
Because of their having no death on the earth.
