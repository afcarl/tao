Everyone in the world calls my Tao “great”
As if nothing resembled it.
Precisely because it is great
Is the reason it seems that nothing resembles it.

Supposing it resembled [something]—
Long-standing indeed its pettiness would be [for] man!

I have three treasures.
Keep and protect them.
The first is called “motherly love”
The second is called “meagerness”
The third is called “not daring to be foremost in the world.”

Motherly love is the reason I can be brave.
Meagerness is the reason I can be expansive.
Not daring to be foremost in the world
Is the reason I can achieve magnanimous leadership.

To desist today from motherly love and so also bravery
From meagerness and so also expansiveness
From being behind and so also being in front—

Is Death indeed.

Those fighting by means of motherly love
Are necessarily victorious
Because [their] defense is completely solid.
Heaven will help them
And
With motherly love
Protect them.
