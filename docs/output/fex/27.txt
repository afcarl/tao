Good traveling is without tracks or footprints.
Good speech is without faulting or blaming.
Good counting does not use tallying methods.
Good closing is without bars or locks and cannot be opened.
Good binding is without ropes or restraints and cannot be unfastened.

Therefore, the sages
Are always good at helping people—
Consequently, they do not cast people aside.
Are always good at helping the physical world—
Consequently, they do not cast the physical world aside.
This is called “entering enlightenment.”

Therefore, those who are good
Are the teachers of those who are not good.
Those who are not good
Are the resources of those who are good.

Not valuing one’s teachers
Not loving one’s resources
Even though [one may be] intelligent
[One is nevertheless] greatly confused.

This is called an essential subtlety.
