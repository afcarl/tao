Those who are [in] the position where the large rivers [meet] the sea
Can thereby become the king of the hundred mountain streams.
Because they are skilled at humbling themselves
Is the reason they can become the king of the hundred mountain streams.

Therefore, the sages
Wishing to be above people
Must [do so] by means of speaking humbly to them.
Wishing to be first [among] people
Must [do so] by means of [placing] themselves behind them.

Therefore, the sages
Are placed on top, and the people are not burdened.
Placed in front, and the people are not harmed.

Therefore, the world is glad to push [them] forward
And does not get tired [of them].

Because they do not contend
Is the reason no one in the world
Is able to contend with them.
