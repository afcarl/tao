Know the masculine.
Keep to the feminine.
Become for the world a valley.
Being a valley for the world,
Constant virtue does not leave.
Return, go back to infanthood.

Know the white.
Keep to the black.
Become for the world an example.
Being an example for the world,
Constant virtue does not err.
Return, go back to non-extremity.

Know the glorious.
Keep to the humble.
Become for the world a waterway.
Being a waterway for the world,
Constant virtue indeed suffices.
Return, go back to simplicity.

Simplicity splits and then becomes instruments.
The sages use them and then become governmental leaders.

Thus, the Great System does not divide.
