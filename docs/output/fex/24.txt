Those on tiptoe do not stand.
Those who straddle do not walk.
Those who show themselves do not shine.
Those who affirm themselves are not made known.
Those who brag about themselves are without merit.
Those who throw their weight around are not leaders.

Those who are with the Tao also say:
“Surplus food, useless forms—
Nature perhaps detests them.”

Therefore, those who have the Tao do not reside [in such things].
