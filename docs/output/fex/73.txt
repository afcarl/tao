The fearless in daring are necessarily killed.
The fearless in not-daring necessarily survive.
Those who are of these two [types]:
Some are benefited.
Some are harmed.

That which is detested by Heaven—who knows the reason?

The Tao of Heaven does not struggle but is good at winning.
Does not speak but is good at responding.
Is not summoned but returns of itself.
Is simple like this but is good at planning.

Heaven’s net is immensely vast.

Lax.

But nothing slips through.
