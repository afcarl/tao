Those of old who were good at governing [with] the Tao
Did not thereby enlighten the people.
[That] would thereby cheat them.

The difficulty of people to govern
Is because of their excessive cleverness.
Therefore, to use cleverness to govern the kingdom
Is [to be] a thief to the kingdom.
Not to use cleverness to govern the kingdom
Is [to be] a blessing to the kingdom.

Those who understand these both
Also examine the System.
Always understanding and examining the System
Is called Mystic Virtue.

Mystic Virtue is mysterious!
Profound!
It grants counter-intuitive things!

Then [you] are truly indeed
The utmost and greatest comfort [to your people].
