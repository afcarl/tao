Heaven is long-lasting; the Earth is old.
Heaven and Earth are placed
By that which can last long and be old.
Because they do not live for themselves
Is the reason they can live long.

Therefore, the sages
Put their bodies behind
And yet their bodies go forward.
Are outside their bodies
And yet their bodies exist.
Do not consider this selflessness to be wrong

For it is the reason they can complete their “selves.”
