People do not fear death
[But] how can [one possibly] endure
[If one] uses death to frighten them?

Suppose the people are made ever to fear death
And that those who act out of the ordinary
I seize, detain, and kill.

Who would dare [to do this]?
Frequently, there those chief executioners who are killed.
Those who take the place of the chief executioners are [also] killed.

This is called usurping the Master Carpenter.
[Among] those who usurp the Master Carpenter

There are few who do not cut their hands.
