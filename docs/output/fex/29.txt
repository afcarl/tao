Should some desire to take the world and run itâ€”
I see they cannot achieve [this].
The world is a spiritual device
Not able to be run, besides.
They who [try to] run it spoil it.
They who hold it in their hands lose it.

Nature might prevail, might comply
Might blow softly, might huff-and-puff
Might be forceful, might win
Might frustrate, might destroy

Therefore, the sage lets go of extremes.
Lets go of extravagance.
Lets go of loftiness.
