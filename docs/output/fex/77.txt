The Way of Heaven—its similarity to stretching a bow?
That which is high—[it] pulls it down.
That which is low—[it] lifts it up.
That which has excess—[it] reduces it.
That which is lacking—[it] adds to it.

The Way of Heaven
Takes away [where] there is excess
And adds to [where there is] lack.

The way of people
Necessarily different
Takes away [where there is] lack
In order to offer to [that which] has excess.

Who can have surplus by means of offering [it] to the world?
Only those who have the Tao.

Therefore, the sages
Act but do not presume
Achieve goals but do not dwell [on them].

They do not desire to be seen as praiseworthy or despicable.
