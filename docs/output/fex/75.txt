The people’s starving
Is because of their superior’s consumption of too many taxes.
Thus the starvation.

The people’s difficulty to govern
Is because of their superior’s possessive governing.
Thus the difficulty to govern.

The people’s reckless deaths
Are because of their seeking the thickness of life.
Thus the reckless deaths.

Only those who do not use life to contrive
Are indeed skilled at valuing life.
