Not to esteem the worthy
Causes the people not to contend.
Not to value goods that are hard to get
Causes the people not to do any stealing.
Not to see desirables
Causes the people’s minds not to be confused.

Therefore, the governance of the sages:
Empties their minds
Makes true their insides
Weakens their determinations
Strengthens their bones
Always causing the people not to know
Not to desire
Causing the clever men not to dare to act!

By doing without “doing”
There is necessarily nothing not managed.
