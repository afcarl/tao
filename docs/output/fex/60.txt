Governing a great kingdom is like quick-frying small delicacies.

[When] using the Tao to manage the world
Its demons are powerless.
[Itâ€™s] not [exactly] that its demons are powerless
[But that] their powers do not harm people.

Not [only is it] that their powers do not harm people
[But] the sages also do not harm people.

Both do not reciprocate harm.

This is the reason [their] virtues mix and thereupon return.
