Filling and operating Life, embracing the One
Can one be without departing [from it]?
Focusing ch’i, bringing about softness
Can one be like a newborn child?
Washing away divisions, mystically perceiving
Can one be flawless?
Loving the kingdom, governing the people
Can one do it without “doing” it?
The Heavenly Door opens, closes
Can one be receptive?
Brightening, purifying the four intelligences
Can one be without knowing?

Give birth to them. Rear them.

Giving birth [to them] but not possessing [them]
Acting [with them] but not presuming [them]
Excelling [with them] but not dominating [with them]—

This is called Mystic Virtue.
