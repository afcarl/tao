The highest good is like unto water.
Water is good at benefiting the ten-thousand things
And does not contend.
It dwells in the places the masses of people detestâ€”
For which reason a few compare [it] with the Tao.

Dwellings are perfected by the earth.
The heart is perfected by depth.
Giving is perfected by benevolence.
Speaking is perfected by sincerity.
Uprightness is perfected by governance.
Function is perfected by ability.
Change is perfected by time.

Only because one does not contend
Is the reason one is without reproach.
