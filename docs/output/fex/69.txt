[About] using soldiers, there exists a saying:
“We dare not act as lords but rather as guests.
[We] do not dare to advance an inch but rather retreat a foot.”

This is called
Prevailing without prevailing
Repelling without an arm
Throwing [them] out without resisting [them]
Holding [them] without a fight.

There is no misfortune greater than trivializing an enemy.
[If we] trivialize an enemy, how many funerals [will be] our “reward”?

Therefore
[When] opposing armies clash with each
Those who mourn are in fact the winners.
