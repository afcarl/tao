[At] a manâ€™s birth, he is flexible and weak.
[At] his death, he is firm and strong.
[At] the birth of trees and grasses, they are flexible and light.
[At] their death, they are dried out and withered.

Therefore, those who are firm and strong are followers of death.
Those who are flexible and weak are disciples of life.

Therefore
The strong army is necessarily destroyed.
The strong tree necessarily snaps.

The strong and large occupy the inferior position.
The flexible and weak occupy the superior position.
