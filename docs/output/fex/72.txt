The people do not fear might
That imitates the Great Might to the extreme.

Do not disrespect their dwelling places.
Do not hate their homelands.

It is only because one does not hate
That one is therefore not hated.

Therefore, the sages
Know themselves but do not display themselves.
Are kind to themselves but do not prize themselves.

Thus, leave that and take up this.
