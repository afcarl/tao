Those of old who were good at being warriors
Were subtly, wonderfully, mystically in communication
With profundities that can’t be fathomed.
Precisely because [the ancient warriors] can’t be fathomed
Is the reason one is forced to take them by appearances:

Cautious… as if in winter, crossing a stream
Strategizing… as if they feared their own four neighbors.
Dignified… they seemed forgiving.
Scattered… like ice floes about to break apart.
Honest… they seemed plain and simple.
Free from worries and petty ideas… they seemed [as open] as a valley.
[Apparently] acting without a plan… they seemed muddled.
Calm… they seemed like the ocean.
Like wind in the mountains… they seemed to be without stagnation.

Who can, in muddiness, use the gradual purification of stillness?
Who can, in serenity, use the gradual arising of movement?

They who hold to this Tao do not desire to overflow.
It’s only by not overflowing

That one can therefore be shielded
And newly made.
