Heaviness acts as the foundation to lightness.
Stillness acts as a sovereign to restlessness.

Therefore, sovereign masters travel all day
And do not depart from [their] “light” heaviness:
Even though there are luxurious sights, comforts, and places—
They rightly rise above [such things].

How does the lord of ten thousand chariots endure
And yet consider himself to be unimportant in the world?

Frivolous laws lose [one’s] foundation.
Rash laws lose [one’s] sovereignty.
