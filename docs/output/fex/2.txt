Everyone in the world knows the being of beautiful to be beautiful.
Thus is ugliness completed.
Everyone knows the being of good to be good.
Thus is evil completed.

Therefore:
Being and non-being give birth to each other.
Difficulty and ease complete each other.
Long and short form each other.
High and low lean on each other.
Notes and music harmonize each other.
Forward and behind follow each other.

Therefore, the sages reside in the function of “non-action”
And practice the teaching of no words.
The ten-thousand things work in many senses and are not dismissed.

Create but do not possess.
Act but do not presume.
Achieve goals but do not dwell on them.
It’s only because one does not dwell on success

That success therefore does not leave.
