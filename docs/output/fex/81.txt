Pleasing speech is not sincere.
Those who are good do not argue.
Those who argue are not good.

Those who understand are not broadly learned.
Those who are broadly learned do not understand.

The sages do not accumulate.
Already, by means of doing for people
They have more and more for themselves.
Already, by means of giving to people
They have more and more—too much—for themselves.

The Way of Heaven is to benefit and not to harm.
The Way of sages is to do but not to struggle.
