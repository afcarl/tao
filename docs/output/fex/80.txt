The small kingdom [with] few people:

Causes them to have the equipment of ten noblemen but not to use it.
Causes the people to give weight to death and not to move far away.
Though having boats and carriages, they’ve no place to ride them.
Though having armor and weapons, they’ve no place to exhibit them.
Causes the people to return to knotting rope and using it.

Sweetens their meals
Beautifies their clothes
Pacifies their abodes
Gladdens [them in] their customs.

The neighboring kingdoms see each other in the distance
Hearing the sounds of each other’s chickens and dogs.
The people arrive at old age [and eventually] die
Without going to or coming from each other.
