Making myself pure, having understanding
I travel on the great Tao.
It gives only this fear:
The great Tao is exceedingly level
But people are pleased with byways.

The imperial court taxes to the extreme.
The fields are altogether overgrown with weeds.
The granaries are completely empty.

Clothed in elegant silk
Girded with sharp swords
Glutted with food and drink
Having a surplus of property and money—

This is called robbing and boasting [about it].

Besides, it’s not the Tao!
