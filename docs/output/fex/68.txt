Those who are skilled at being warriors are not warlike.
Those who are skilled at fighting are not angry.
Those who are skilled at overcoming enemies do not engage [them].
Those who are skilled at managing people act humbly toward them.

This is called the virtue of non-contention.
This is called the power of managing people.
This is called merging with Heaven, the Oldest of Old.
