[When] the world has the Tao
[It] retires trotting horses to fertilize the soil.
[When] the world lacks the Tao
War horses are bred in the suburbs.

Of misfortunes, there is none greater than not knowing sufficiency.
Of faults, there is none greater than desiring gain.

This is the reason that to know the sufficiency of sufficiency
Is a lasting sufficiency indeed.
