The forming of exceeding virtue—
Only the Tao indeed manages [to do].
The functioning “substance” of the Tao is only indistinct, only vague.
So vague! So indistinct! Within it exists shape.
So indistinct! So vague! Within it exists the physical world.
So obscure! So profound! Within it exists essence.

Its essence is exceedingly real—
Within it exists the evidence [for this].

From ancient times even unto the present day
Its name has not departed.
Thereby inspect the many beginnings.
How do I thereby know the form of the many beginnings?

With this.
