The sages are without fixed minds.
Therefore, the hundred clans’ mind
Do [the sages] take to be [their own] mind.

Those who are good, I am good to them.
Those who are not good, I am also good to them.
[This is] virtue [as] goodness.

Those who are sincere, I am sincere to them.
Those who are not sincere, I am also sincere to them.
[This is] virtue [as] sincerity.

The sages living in the world thereupon take everything in
Acting in the world, merging their minds.
The hundred clans—each one—pays attention with its ears and eyes.

The sages all treat them as children.
