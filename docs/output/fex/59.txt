[In] governing the people and serving Heaven
There is nothing like thriftiness.

Only thriftiness is rightly called “yielding beforehand.”
Yielding beforehand
Entails [one’s] arrival at a hard-won accumulation of virtue.

[With this] hard-won accumulation of virtue
[There is] necessarily nothing not overcome.
[When] nothing is not overcome
[There is] necessarily no one who knows your limits.
[When] there are none who know your limits
[You] can therefore have a kingdom.

[When you] have the mother of the kingdom
[You] can thereby endure for a long time.

This is called “deeply rooted”
“A solid foundation.”

The way of long life and lasting vision.
