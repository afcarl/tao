The world had a beginning.
Itâ€™s regarded as being a mother to the world.

Having attained its mother
Thereby know its offspring.
Having known its offspring
Return, hold to its mother.

Not having a body, there is no danger.

Stop the exchange
Close the openings
Throughout, the body does not strive.

Open the exchange
Abet the affairs
Throughout, the body is not helped.

Seeing the lowly is called illumination.
Maintaining flexibility is called strength.

Use the light.
Return, go back to the illumination.
Not losing the body is a disaster.

Indeed, be practicing always.
