A way that can be spoken
Is not a lasting way.
A name that can be named
Is not a lasting name.

Without a name: the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
Having names: the mother of the ten thousand things.

Therefore:
Constantly without desire, thereby observe the mystery.
Constantly with desire, thereby observe the boundaries.

Those which these two are produced by
Are the same but named differently.

The abstraction of calling them the same
The abstraction upon abstractionâ€”

The gateway to a host of mysteries.
