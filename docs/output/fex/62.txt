That which the Tao is:
A deep obscurity among the ten-thousand things.

The treasure of kind people.
The sanctuary of unkind people.

Flattering speech can be used to buy and sell honor.
Flattering deeds can be used to increase [the position of] people.

The unkind among people—
Why abandon them to Existence?

Therefore, [when] establishing the emperor
And placing the three high officials
Even though there are salutations [made]
And [so many] jade-wares [that it takes]
An advancing team of four horses [to present them]

[Even this is] not as good as sitting down
And offering this Tao.

Those from of old who considered this Tao to be valuable—
Why [did they do so]?

[Is it] not said:
“The seeking thereby attain;
The guilty are thereby delivered from evil”?

Therefore, [it] become[s] to the world what is precious.
