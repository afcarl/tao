Should one wish to condense it, one must certainly expand it.
Should one wish to weaken it, one must certainly strengthen it.
Should one wish to abolish it, one must certainly boost it.
Should one wish to receive it, one must certainly give it.

This is called “subtle illumination.”
The flexible and weak overcome the firm and strong.

Fish are not able to escape from the deeps—
The beneficial tools of the state
Are not able, therefore, to be shown to people.
