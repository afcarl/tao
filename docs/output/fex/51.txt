The Tao gives birth to them
Virtue rears them
Nature forms them
Conditions complete them.

Therefore, of the ten-thousand things
There are none that do not honor the Tao
And value Virtue.
The honoring of the Tao
The valuing of Virtue:
Man does not command them [to do so]
And they are always genuinely themselves
Because the Tao gives birth to them
And Virtue raises them

Leads them, nourishes them
Erects them, poisons them
Supports them, destroys them.

Giving birth but not possessing
Acting but not presuming
Leading but not oppressively ruling—

This is called “Mystic Virtue.”
