When the great Tao is abandoned
There exists humaneness and righteousness.
When intelligence and wit go forth
There exists greatness and deception.
When the six familial relationships are not in harmony
There exists obedience and charity.
When kingdoms and households are in darkness and chaos
There exists loyalty and subjugation.
