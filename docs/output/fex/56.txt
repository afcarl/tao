Therefore:
It is not able to be obtained, yet it is near.
It is not able to be obtained, and it is distant.
It is not able to be obtained, yet it benefits.
It is not able to be obtained, yet it harms.
It is not able to be obtained, yet it is valuable.
It is not able to be obtained, yet it is worthless.

Therefore, [it] become[s] for the world what is precious.
