Heaven and Earth are not humane
For the ten-thousand things are taken to be straw dogs.
Sages are not humane
For the hundred clans are taken to be straw dogs.

The space between Heaven and Earthâ€”
Its similarity to bellows and flutes?
Empty but not exhausted.
Use it and more and more is produced.

With too many words and ideas is distress.

This is not as good as staying in the middle.
