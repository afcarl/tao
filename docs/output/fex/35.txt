Hold the Great Shape in your hands.
The world departs.
Departs and does not harmâ€”
Peaceful and leveled to the extreme.

[For] music and dumplings
Do the passing travelers stop.
But the going forth of the Tao is insipid to the mouth
From its being without flavor.

Inspecting it is not sufficient to see it.
Listening for it is not sufficient to hear it.

Using it is not sufficient to exhaust it.
