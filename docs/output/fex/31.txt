Those who delight in the military are instruments of ill fortune—
Nature perhaps detests them.
Therefore, those who possess the Tao do not dwell [with them].
Sovereign masters, [while at] home, necessarily value the left.
Using the military necessarily values the right.

Those who are warlike are instruments of ill fortune
Not the instruments of the sovereign master.
[When the situation is] already disharmonious
And [they have to] use them
[They do so] calmly, without relish, [thus] becoming superior.
[They] “win” but do not delight [in it].

And those who delight in it
Indeed enjoy killing people.

Those who enjoy killing people
Are necessarily unable to obtain their ambitions in the world.

Fortunate affairs honor the left.
Unfortunate affairs honor the right.
The subordinate general occupies the left.
The commanding general occupies the right.
It is said they use funerary rites to commemorate them.

A multitude of people [have been] killed—
Therefore mourn, lament, and weep for them.

[After] overcoming [them] in war
Use funerary rites to commemorate them.
