The five colors make people’s eyes blind.
The five tones make people’s ears deaf.
The five flavors make people’s mouths lose [their tasting ability].
Hurrying, rushing, hunting, and chasing
Make people’s minds issue forth insanity.
Goods that are hard to get cause people’s doings to harm.

Therefore, the sages
Act by the insides, not by the eyes.

Therefore, let go of that
And take up this.
