Do [things] without “doing” [them].
Work without working.
Taste without tasting.
[Make] the great small
[And] the many few.

Respond to adversity with [this] virtue.

Seek the difficult through the easy.
Manage the great through the minute.

Difficult matters in the world must be done through the easy ones.
Great matters must be done through the minute ones.
Thus, the sages at no time do great [things].
This is the reason they can achieve the great [things].

Those who make frivolous promises are certainly bereft of sincerity.
Too much ease most certainly [results in] too much difficulty.
Therefore do the sages
[Treat things] as though they [were] difficult

And so they are, throughout [their lives], without difficulties!
