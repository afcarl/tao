Fine weapons are inauspicious instruments.
They are probably detested by the people.
Therefore, he who is possessed of Tao rejects them.
The superior man honors the left in time of peace;
In time of war he honors the right.
Weapons are inauspicious instruments;
They are not instruments for the superior man.
He uses them only under dire necessity,
And in this case priority is given to moderation.
He does not consider victory a fine thing.
Those who consider victory a fine thing
Are those who delight in slaughtering people.
Those who delight in slaughtering people
Can never gratify their ambition to win the world.
Therefore, the left is favored for felicitous occasions;
For mournful occasions, the right is favored.
The second-in-command stands on the left,
While the commander-in-chief stands on the right;
For according to funeral rites are they treated.
Mass slaughter is to be bewailed with grief and sorrow.
Victory is to be mourned with funeral rites.
