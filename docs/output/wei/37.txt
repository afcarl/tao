Tao is eternal and devoid of action,
Yet there is nothing it does not do.
If kings and nobles can preserve it intact,
The ten thousand things will reform of themselves.
If after the reform they desire to be active,
I shall calm them with the Nameless Simplicity (p'u),
The Nameless Simplicity will induce desirelessness,
Desirelessness will tend to quiescence,
And the world will set itself on the right course.
