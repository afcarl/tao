Tao gave birth to One;
One gave birth to Two;
Two gave birth to Three;
Three gave birth to the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things carry Yin and embrace Yang.
The two primordial breaths blend and produce harmony.
To be orphaned or lonely or unworthy
Is what all people detest;
Yet kings and nobles apply those terms to themselves.
Indeed, things sometimes benefit by an intended injury,
And sometimes receive injury from an intended benefit.
What others teach, I shall also teach:
"The strong and violent will die an unnatural death."
This will serve as my chief lesson.
