When the government is shrouded in gloom,
The people will be simple and honest.
When the government is sharp and officious,
The people will get disgusted and discontented.
Misfortune is what fortune leans on;
Fortune is where misfortune conceals itself.
Who can know the ultimate result?
Is there no justice?
Anyway, justice will become injustice again,
And good will turn into evil once more.
Mankind has been thus deluded for a long time.
That's why the Sage acts four-square,
But does not "cut" people to his own shape;
He has a high sense of integrity,
But is not offensive to people;
He is upright and straightforward,
But does not push people around;
He is bright and brilliant,
But does not outshine people.
