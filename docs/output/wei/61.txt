A great country should assume a low position.
Being the hub of the world,
It should play the part of the Female.
The Female always employs quiescence
To subdue the Male, and takes a low position.
Therefore, a big country, stooping low,
Will win over a small country;
And a small country, staying low,
Will win over a big country.
Therefore, some stoop low to conquer,
And some stay low to conquer.
What a big country wants is merely
To absorb and support more people;
What a small country wants is merely
To enter a big country to offer services.
For each of the two to get what it wants,
The big country, therefore, should be lowly.
