Do not exalt the worthy,
So that the people will not contend.
Do not treasure hard-to-get objects,
So that the people will not become thieves.
Keep what is desirable out of sight,
So that their heart will not get excited.
Therefore, in ruling the people the Sage
Empties their hearts,
Fills their bellies,
Weakens their aspirations,
Strengthens their bones.
He always makes them guileless and desireless,
And makes the guileful ones afraid to interfere.
Practice non-interference,
And there will never be any misrule.
