Those adept in establishing themselves
Cannot be plucked up;
Those adept in the act of embracing
Cannot be made to relax their hold.
They are worshipped for generations in a row.
Cultivate Tao in one's person,
And its virtue will be genuine;
Cultivate Tao in one's family,
And its virtue will be overflowing;
Cultivate Tao in one's village,
And its virtue will be long enduring;
Cultivate Tao in one's state,
And its virtue will be abundant;
Cultivate Tao in one's empire,
And its virtue will be pervasive.
Therefore,
By one's person, one sizes up other persons;
By one's family, one sizes up other families;
By one's village, one sizes up other villages;
By one's state, one sizes up other states;
By one's empire, one sizes up other empires.
How do I know this is so with the empire?
By this.
