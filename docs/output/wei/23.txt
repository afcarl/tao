Nature is brief in its speech.
Thus a tempest does not last a whole morning,
Nor does a rainstorm last a whole day.
What is it that causes the wind and rain?
It is Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot be long in their outbursts.
How much the less can man in his!
Therefore, in the pursuit of Tao,
Those tending toward Tao will identify with Tao;
Those tending toward virtue will identify with virtue;
Those tending toward failure will identify with failure.
To those identified with Tao,
Tao will gladly extend welcome;
To those identified with virtue,
Virtue will gladly extend welcome;
To those identified with failure,
Failure will gladly extend welcome.
When one's own faith is inadequate,
It will not evoke faith from other people.
