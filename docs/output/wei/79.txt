In allaying a great grievance,
There is bound to be some grievance remaining.
How can this be called good?
Therefore the Sage holds the left tally,
But does not urge the other party to keep his word.
Thus the virtuous seeks to preserve the contract;
The unvirtuous seeks to blame the other party.
The Way of Heaven has no preferences,
But always suits the good man.
