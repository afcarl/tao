To learn, one increases day by day;
To cultivate Tao, one reduces day by day.
Reduce and reduce and keep on reducing,
Till the state of non-action is reached.
With non-action there is nothing that cannot be done.
Therefore, he who wins the world
Always resorts to non-action.
Once he resorts to action,
He will not be qualified to win the world.
