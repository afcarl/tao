Thirty spokes converge on the nave of a wheel:
It is where there is non-being (hollow space)
That the usefulness of the wheel lies.
Clay is molded into a vessel:
It is where there is non-being
That the usefulness of the vessel lies.
Doors and windows are hewn out to make a room:
It is where there is non-being
That the usefulness of the room lies.
Therefore, while being is valuable,
It is non-being that is useful.
