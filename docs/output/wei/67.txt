All the world says I am great
But rather odd and different from the ordinary.
Be it noted that greatness itself is the very reason
Why it appears rather odd and different from the ordinary.
If it had resembled the ordinary,
It would have become pettiness long ago.
I have three treasures.
Keep them and treasure them.
The first is compassion;
The second is frugality;
The third is:
Dare not be first in the world.
Because compassionate, a person can be courageous;
Because frugal, he can expand his scope;
Because he dare not be first in the world, he can develop his gifts of leadership.
Nowadays people are courageous without compassion,
Expand their scope without frugality,
And assume leadership without being humble.
They are doomed!
Compassion is invincible in offense,
And in defense invulnerable.
When Heaven wants to deliver a person from harm,
It grants him compassion as a protective charm.
