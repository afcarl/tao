Wishing to restrict anything,
One must first expand it;
Wishing to weaken anything,
One must first strengthen it;
Wishing to abolish anything,
One must first set it up;
Wishing to take from anything,
One must first supply it.
This is called Faint Light.
The soft conquers the hard;
The weak conquers the strong.
Fish should not break forth from the deep;
Deadly weapons of the state must not be shown off.
