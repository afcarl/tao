The good scholars of ancient times
Were keen, astute, mysterious, and intuitive.
They were so profound as to be incomprehensible.
Since they show themselves incomprehensible,
They must be depicted in some arbitrary way:
They were cautious as if fording a stream in winter,
Hesitant as if afraid of the neighbors around,
Dignified as if in the role of a guest;
They were easy-going, like ice about to melt,
Unpretentious, like wood in its virgin state,
Open-minded, like a valley,
And murky, like turbid water.
Who, being like turbid water, can remain calm,
So that quiescence will gradually lead to clarity?
Who can stay relaxed for a long while,
So that an impulse will gradually lead to Life?
He who conserves this Tao does not go to the limit.
For the reason that he does not go to the limit,
He can wear well and does not need renewal.
