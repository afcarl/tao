Ruling a big country is like frying a little fish.
When Tao is made to prevail in the world,
Evil spirits will lose their supernal power.
Not that they lose their supernal power,
But rather that the supernal power does no harm to people.
Not only the supernal power does no harm to people,
The Sage (Ruler) also will do no harm.
As both do not mutually cause any harm,
Virtue reverts to all parties respectively.
