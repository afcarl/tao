The Way of Heaven,
Is it not like stretching the bow?
What is high is brought low;
What is low is pulled up;
What is superfluous is taken off;
What is deficient is strengthened.
The Way of Heaven takes from what has a surplus
To supply what has a deficit.
The way of men acts differently.
It takes from what has a deficit
To serve what has a surplus.
Who will use his surplus to serve the world?
Only the man who is possessed of Tao.
Thus the Sage acts but does not presume on the result;
He achieves success but does not claim any credit.
Doesn't this show that he dislikes showing off his worth?
