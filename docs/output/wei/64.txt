What is secure can be easily maintained.
What is yet unmanifest can be easily tackled.
What is brittle can be easily broken.
What is puny can be easily scattered.
Act before any trouble starts.
Enforce order before disorder arises.
A big tree, whose girth fills a man's embrace,
Springs from a tender shoot.
A terrace nine stories in height
Rises from a heap of earth.
A journey one thousand miles long
Begins with the first step.
He who interferes will fail;
He who grasps will lose.
Therefore, the Sage does not interfere,
And incurs no failure;
He does not grasp,
And suffers no loss.
People in handling their affairs
Often fail when within an ace of fulfilment.
Be circumspect at the end as at the beginning,
And there will be no failure.
Therefore the Sage desires what is not desired (by others),
And does not treasure hard-to-get objects.
He learns what is not learned (by others),
And restores what the multitude has skipped.
He assists the natural trend of all things,
But dares not venture to tamper with it.
