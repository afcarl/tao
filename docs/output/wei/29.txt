One might wish to get hold of the world,
And wilfully interfere with it.
In my view, this is bound to fail.
The world is a Divine Vessel.
It cannot be interfered with.
He who interferes with it spoils it;
He who grasps it loses it.
For among the creatures of the world,
Some are leaders, some are followers;
Some tend to condone, some to condemn;
Some are strong, some are weak;
Some are forward-looking, some are downcast.
The Sage, therefore, eschews the excessive,
Eschews the extravagant, and eschews the extreme.
