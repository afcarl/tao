In ruling men and serving Heaven,
Nothing is comparable to a prudent economy.
A prudent economy means early preparation;
Early preparation means further accumulation of virtue;
Further accumulation of virtue can subdue everything;
The ability to subdue everything knows no bounds;
Knowing no bounds (in subduing opposition)
Can lead to the possession of a kingdom;
Possession of a kingdom along with its Mother
Can endure a long time.
This is called "deep roots and strong stalks."
It is the way to eternal life and everlasting vision.
