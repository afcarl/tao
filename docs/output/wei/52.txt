The world has a beginning as its mother.
Having got hold of the mother,
Know her children;
And having known the children,
Further hold on to the mother,
And you will survive the disappearance of the body.
Stop up the aperture of the vessel (tui),
And shut the doors (of the senses),
And you will not be devitalized all your life.
Open the aperture of the vessel,
And fulfill your carnal affairs,
And your whole life will be beyond salvation.
To be able to see the minute is to have keen vision;
To be able to remain docile is to be strong.
Make use of the light,
Withdraw its brilliance inward,
Cause no injury to your body -
This is called "Abide by the Immutable."
