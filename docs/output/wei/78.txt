Nothing in the world
Surpasses water in softness and weakness;
Yet among things that attack the hard and strong,
None can do a better job than water.
Nothing can serve as its substitute.
Therefore the weak overcomes the strong;
The soft overcomes the hard.
Few in the world do not know this;
Yet nobody is able to put it into practice.
Therefore the Sage says:
He who bears the blame for the ignominy of his country
Can be called lord of the state;
He who bears the blame for the misfortune of his country
Can become king of the world.
Statements of the truth seem paradoxical.
