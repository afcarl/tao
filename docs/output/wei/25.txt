There is something formless and perfect,
Ever-existing, even before birth of Heaven and Earth.
How still it is!
How quiet!
Abiding alone and unchanging,
It pervades everywhere without fail.
Well may it be the mother of the world.
I do not know its name,
But label it Tao,
And arbitrarily name it Great.
Great means going incessantly;
Going incessantly means reaching far;
Reaching far means completing the cycle.
Therefore,
Tao is Great;
Heaven is Great;
Earth is Great;
Kingliness is Great.
In the cosmos there are four Greats,
And Kingliness constitutes one of them.
Man patterns after Earth;
Earth patterns after Heaven;
Heaven patterns after Tao;
Tao patterns after Innate Freedom.
