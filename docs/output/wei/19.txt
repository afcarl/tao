Forswear wisdom, discard knowledge,
And the people will gain a hundredfold.
Forswear benevolence, discard righteousness,
And the people will recover filial and parental love.
Forswear skill, discard profit,
And thieves and robbers will not appear.
These three steps are inadequate for culture.
They, therefore, have to encompass some others,
Such as:
Display plainness, embrace simplicity,
Reduce selfishness, and decrease desires.
