Use justice to rule a country;
Use strange tactics to conduct battles;
Use non-assertion to win the world.
How do I know this should be the case?
By this -
When the world abounds in prohibitions,
The people will become impoverished.
When men have plenty of weapons in hand,
The state will be in great confusion.
When men have plenty of techniques and skills,
Queer articles will crop up in abundance.
When laws and decrees are numerous and manifest,
Bandits and robbers will increase and multiply.
Therefore, the Sage has said -
I practice non-interference,
And the people reform themselves;
I love to be quiescent,
And the people become upright;
I do not assert myself,
And the people become wealthy;
I cherish no desires,
And the people become simple and innocent.
