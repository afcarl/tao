Tao is a mystery within all things.
It is a treasure to the good men;
To the bad men it gives protection.
Fine words may be shown at the market place;
Noble deeds may serve as gifts to people.
Some people may not be good,
But why should any of them be discarded?
Therefore, when an emperor is enthroned,
Or when the three chief ministers are installed,
Though they may have fine pieces of jade
Respectfully presented before the team of horses,
There is nevertheless nothing better for them
Than to sit (in meditation) and advance in Tao.
For what reason did the ancients prize this Tao?
Did they not say:
"With Tao one finds what one seeks,
And can get pardoned for one's offenses"?
Hence Tao is highly prized by the world.
