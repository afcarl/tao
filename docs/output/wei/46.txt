When the world goes in accord with Tao,
Horses are used for hauling manure.
When the world is out of keeping with Tao,
Horses are reared in the suburbs for war.
No sin is greater than yielding to desires;
No misfortune greater than not knowing contentment;
No fault greater than hankering after wealth.
Therefore, know contentment!
He who knows contentment is always content.
