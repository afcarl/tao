He who is profoundly endowed with virtue
May be compared to an infant.
Poisonous insects do not sting him;
Wild beasts do not seize hold of him;
Birds of prey do not pounce upon him.
Weak in bone and soft in sinews,
He yet has a firm grip.
Though ignorant of intercourse between the sexes,
His genital organ is yet firm and strong,
Indicating the plenitude of his vital essence.
He may scream all day,
Yet his voice does not become hoarse,
Indicating the plenitude of his inner harmony.
To know harmony is to accord with the Immutable;
To accord with the Immutable means enlightenment.
Improvement in health is a good omen;
Mental control of the breath means strength.
Things begin to decay after reaching the prime.
Decay indicates disregard of Tao.
Whatever disregards Tao soon vanishes.
