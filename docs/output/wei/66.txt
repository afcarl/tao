That rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys
Is because they are good in staying low.
That's why they can be kings of all valleys.
Thus the Sage wishing to be above the people
Always speaks as if he were inferior to them;
And wishing to lead the people,
Always places himself behind them.
So when the Sage occupies a high position,
The people do not feel any oppression;
And when he occupies a leading position,
The people do not receive any harm.
Therefore the world is glad to support him,
And never gets tired of doing so.
Because he does not contend,
No one in the world can contend with him.
