What is invisible when looked at is called yi;
What is inaudible when listened to is called hsi;
What is elusive when grabbed at is called wei.
These three are not amenable to investigation;
Therefore, they mingle as One.
On rising, the One does not become bright;
On falling, it does not become dark.
Unnameable it goes on and on,
And again reverts to Non-Being.
This is called shape of the shapeless,
And form of the formless.
This is called winking-waning, as in a dream.
On greeting it, one cannot see its front;
On following it, one cannot see its back.
Taking hold of the Tao of antiquity
To cope with the problems of the present
Could make one know the ancient origins.
This is called the unbroken strand of Tao.
