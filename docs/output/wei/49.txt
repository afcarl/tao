The Sage has no fixed state of mind;
His reflects the state of mind of the people.
To the good, I show goodness;
To the not good, I also show goodness;
Hence goodness is realized.
To the sincere, I show sincerity;
To the insincere, I also show sincerity;
Hence sincerity is realized.
While in the world, the Sage is very anxious
To harmonize his mind for the harmony of the world.
To him all the people turn their eyes and ears;
He treats them all alike as children.
