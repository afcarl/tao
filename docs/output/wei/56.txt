Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Stop up the aperture of the vessel,
Shut the doors of the senses,
Blunt the sharp,
Unravel the tangled,
Harmonize with the light,
Merge with the dust, -
This is called Mystic Assimilation.
Men with this attainment, therefore, are
Above endearment or estrangement,
Above enrichment or impoverishment,
And above exaltation or degradation.
Therefore they are highly honored by the world.
