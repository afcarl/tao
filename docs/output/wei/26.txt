Heaviness is the root of lightness;
Quiescence is the master of hastiness.
Thus the Sage traveling all day
Will not stay away from his loaded cart.
Though glorious prospects are in view,
He remains serene in a transcendental atmosphere.
For what reason should it be
That a weighty person like the lord of ten thousand chariots
Would consider himself lighter than worldly vanities?
In making light of himself, he loses his ministers;
In being hasty, he loses his kingly command.
