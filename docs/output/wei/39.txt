Since antiquity, these have possessed the One -
Heaven in possession of the One has become clear;
Earth in possession of the One has become steady;
Spirits in possession of the One have become divine;
Valleys in possession of the One have become full;
Creatures in possession of the One have become alive;
Kings and nobles in possession of the One have become exemplary.
All the above became what they are in the same way.
Heaven without the One to make it clear
Is apt to crack;
Earth without the One to make it steady
Is apt to quake;
Spirits without the One to make them divine
Are apt to cease operation;
Valleys without the One to make them full
Are apt to become dry;
Creatures without the One to make them alive
Are apt to become extinct;
Kings and nobles without the One to make them exemplary
Are apt to lose their prestige and eminence.
Forsooth, the honorable is rooted in the humble,
And the high is founded on the low.
So kings and nobles call themselves orphaned, lonely, and unworthy.
Does not this indicate that the honorable is rooted in the humble?
Indeed, if a chariot is taken apart,
There will no longer be any chariot.
Desire not to be like polished jade,
But rather to be like rough rocks.
