Heaven and Earth are not kindly;
They equate the ten thousand things with straw dogs.
The Sage is not kindly;
He equates the people with straw dogs.
The space between Heaven and Earth,
Is it not like a bellows?
It is hollow, yet it never fails to supply.
The more it is worked, the more it gives forth.
Much talk often leads to exhaustion.
Better concentrate on the center.
