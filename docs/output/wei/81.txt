Truthful words do not sound sweet;
Sweet words are not truthful.
Good men do not argue;
Those who argue are lacking in goodness.
The seers of truth are not vast in learning;
People with vast learning are not seers.
The Sage does not hoard.
The more he serves the people,
The more he gains.
The more he gives to the people,
The more he possesses.
The Way of Heaven is to benefit, not to harm;
The way of the Sage is to act, not to contend.
