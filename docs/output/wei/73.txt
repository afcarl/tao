Courage in daring leads to slaughter;
Courage in daring not leads to life.
Either may have its advantage or disadvantage.
When Heaven detests anything,
Who can know the reason why?
Thus even the Sage feels some difficulty here.
Heaven's way does not contend, yet excels in winning;
It does not speak, yet excels in making response;
It receives no summons, yet would come of itself;
It is patient and easy-going, yet excels in planning.
The net of Heaven spreads far and wide;
Though its meshes are large,
Yet it allows nothing to slip through.
