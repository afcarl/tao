When all the world knows beauty as beauty,
Then ugliness comes into being;
When all the world knows goodness as goodness,
Then evil comes into being.
Therefore,
Being and Non-Being condition each other;
Difficult and Easy give rise to each other;
Long and Short set off each other;
High and Low contrast each other;
Tone and Voice harmonize each other;
Front and Rear succeed each other.
Thus the Sage handles affairs non-assertively,
And imparts his teaching without words.
The ten thousand things grow apace,
But he does not let them down.
He produces but does not claim ownership;
He acts but does not presume on the result;
He achieves success but does not take the credit.
For the very reason that he takes no credit,
Credit does not separate from him.
