Military strategists have said -
I dare not be the host,
But prefer to be the guest.
I dare not advance one inch,
But prefer to retreat a foot.
This is called -
Marching as if without motion;
Brandishing arms as if having none;
Attacking as if without enmity;
Seizing as if without weapons.
No disaster is greater than belittling the enemy.
Belittling the enemy almost ruins my treasures.
Therefore, when two armies encounter each other,
The side that laments war will win.
