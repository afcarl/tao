Practice non-interference.
Assert non-assertion.
Taste the tasteless.
Regard small as great, little as much.
Requite evil with virtue.
Tackle difficult tasks while they are easy;
Perform great tasks while they are small.
Difficult tasks must be begun when yet easy;
Great tasks must be begun when yet small.
That's why the Sage, to the end of his days,
Does not have to tackle great tasks,
And for this very reason achieves greatness.
Promises lightly made show little good faith;
Duties neglected are bound to become difficult.
That's why the Sage assumes things to be difficult,
And never in life incurs any difficulty.
