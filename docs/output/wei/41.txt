The first-rate scholar, on hearing Tao,
Is diligent in practicing it;
The second-rate scholar, on hearing Tao,
Wavers between faith and forgetfulness;
The third-rate scholar, on hearing Tao,
Bursts into loud laughter.
If not laughed at, it would not be Tao!
Hence the following proverbs -
He who understands Tao seems confounded by it.
He who advances toward Tao seems retreating from it.
He who follows plain Tao seems treading on rugged ground.
Superior virtue appears to be hollow.
Perfect purity appears to be tainted.
Vast virtue appears to be inadequate.
Solid virtue appears to be infirm.
Genuine substance appears to be spurious.
Vast space is devoid of corners.
Great talent is late in maturing.
A high note can hardly be heard.
The Great Form has no sign.
Tao is hidden and has no name;
Yet only Tao excels in contributing to achievement.
