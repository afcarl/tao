He who uses Tao to assist the ruler of a people
Will not employ armed force to dominate the world.
For such a scheme is apt to boomerang.
Where armies are quartered,
Briers and brambles abound.
After a great war, famine inevitably happens.
Therefore,
A good-natured man attains his objective and stops;
He dares not grab by violence.
He wants to attain his objective,
But does not extol it,
Nor brag about it, nor take pride in it.
He attains his objective as if it could not be helped,
And does not use it to practice violence.
For things, after their prime, will begin to decay.
Decay indicates disregard of Tao.
Whatever disregards Tao soon vanishes.
