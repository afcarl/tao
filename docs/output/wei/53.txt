If I were determined, with the knowledge I have,
To walk along the Great Highway,
My only fear would be to stray from it.
The Great Highway is very safe and plain;
Yet people prefer the bypaths.
While the Court is very magnificent,
The fields have become very barren,
And the granaries have become very empty;
Yet officials are dressed in gorgeous garments,
Carry sharp swords,
Gorge themselves with sumptuous food and drink,
And possess a superabundance of precious articles.
Such patent robbery is the usher of other robberies.
Verily it goes contrary to Tao.
