Tao is eternal and has no name.
Though P'u (Simplicity) may appear puny,
Yet the world dare not dominate it.
If kings and nobles can preserve it intact,
The ten thousand things will gladly pay them homage.
Heaven and Earth unite in harmony
To pour down showers of sweet dew,
To benefit all mankind graciously and evenly.
Institutions once begun, names come into being.
Names having come into being,
One should know where to rest.
To know where to rest is to forestall peril.
Tao differentiated in the world (will return to One),
Like streams and rivers flowing to the sea.
