Heaven is eternal, Earth is durable.
The reason why they are eternal and durable
Is that they do not exist for themselves.
This is why they can long endure.
Therefore, the Sage putting himself behind,
Finds himself in front;
And placing himself beyond his concern,
Finds himself well preserved.
Is this not because he is unselfish?
For the very reason that he is unselfish,
He is able to find Self-fulfilment.
