A good walker leaves no traces behind;
A good speaker leaves no blemishes for criticism;
A good counter does not use counting chips;
A good lock has no bolt, yet cannot be opened;
A good knot has no string, yet cannot be untied.
Thus the Sage (in his silent and subtle way)
Is always good in saving people,
Thereby leaving no people unsaved;
And always good in saving things,
Thereby leaving nothing unsaved.
This is called "Passing the light."
Hence the good man is the teacher of the bad,
And the bad is object lesson for the good.
He who does not honor his teacher,
Nor loves any object lesson,
Is lost in a great maze, clever though he may be.
Such is called Significant Subtlety.
