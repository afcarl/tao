Favor and disgrace both seem startling.
Honor is great trouble if identified with the self.
What does it mean by saying
That favor and disgrace both seem startling?
Favor descends from superior to inferior.
The recipient seems startled upon getting it;
He seems no less startled upon losing it.
This is what it means by saying
That favor and disgrace both seem startling.
What does it mean by saying
That honor is great trouble if identified with the self?
The reason why I have great trouble
Is that I have a self;
If I am selfless and unselfish,
What trouble do I have?
Therefore, he who feels honored
In offering himself for the world,
Can be assigned the rule of the world;
He who loves to offer himself for the world,
Can be trusted with the world.
