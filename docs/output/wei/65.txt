The ancients who were adept in following Tao
Used it not to develop the people's intelligence,
But to keep the people simple-minded.
People are difficult to rule,
Because they have too much knowledge.
Therefore, to use knowledge to rule a country
Inflicts a curse on the country;
Not to use knowledge to rule a country
Confers a boon on the country.
He who is aware of these two rules
Also sets a standard pattern (as the ancients did).
Awareness of the standard pattern is called Mystic Virtue.
As Mystic Virtue goes deep and reaches far,
And leads creatures to revert to their origin,
Then Great Concord will prevail.
