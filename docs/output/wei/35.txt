Hold fast to the Great Form,
And wherever in the world you go,
You will meet with no harm,
But enjoy security, peace, and well-being.
Where there is music with good food,
The passers-by will pause and linger.
But Tao, on being set forth orally,
Is insipid and tasteless.
It is invisible when looked at,
And inaudible when listened to,
Yet its utility will never come to an end.
