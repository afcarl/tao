Which is more dear:
Fame or health?
Which is more valuable:
Health or wealth?
Which is more baneful:
Gain or loss?
Excessive love is bound to cause great expense.
Immense hoarding is bound to end in heavy loss.
He who knows contentment is free from disgrace;
He who knows when to quit will be free from peril.
He can endure a long time.
