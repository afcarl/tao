He, who knows the Male
And yet holds on to the Female,
Becomes the ravine of the world.
Being the ravine of the world,
He is always in union with Eternal Virtue,
And returns to the state of the new-born babe.
He, who knows the white (Yang)
And yet holds on to the black (Yin),
Becomes a model for the world.
Being a model for the world,
His Eternal Virtue becomes unerring,
And he returns to the Infinite.
He, who is aware of glory
And yet holds on to ignominy,
Becomes the valley of the world.
Being the valley of the world,
His Eternal Virtue becomes sufficient,
And he returns to the state of virgin wood (simplicity).
The virgin wood, on being cut up, is used as implements.
Sages, who make use of the implements,
Become high officials and leaders.
The Supreme Ruler uses the wood without cutting it.
