The Great Tao having been abandoned,
There arise benevolence and righteousness.
With the emergence of wit and wisdom,
There comes into being monstrous hypocrisy.
When the six relatives fail to live in harmony,
There arise filial piety and parental love.
When the state falls into darkness and disorder,
There come into existence loyal ministers.
