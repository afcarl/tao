As life emerges, death enters.
The agents of life are thirteen;
The agents of death are likewise thirteen;
The thirteen also may make men move in a death spot.
Why so?
Because life is lived in too intense a manner.
I have heard that -
He, who is adept in guarding his life,
Will not come across rhinoceros and tigers,
When travelling on land;
And when in the armed forces,
Will not get wounded by deadly weapons.
In him the rhinoceros can find no place to butt,
Nor can the tiger find any place to claw,
Nor can the weapons find any place to injure.
Why so?
Because there is no death spot in him.
