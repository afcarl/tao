Forswear learning, and vexation will vanish.
Between an abrupt "Yes" and a gentle "Yea,"
How much is the difference?
Between the good and the bad,
How much is the difference?
What others fear, one should also fear -
What a silly notion!
Whither will it lead?
Merrily, merrily, the multitude is rejoicing,
As if feasting after the Great Sacrifice,
As if mounting the Terrace of Love.
I alone remain indifferent and show no emotion,
Like an infant as yet unable to smile.
Wandering aimlessly,
I look like a homeless tramp.
The multitude all have enough and to spare;
I alone seem to be left on the wayside.
Oh, my mind is indeed like that of an idiot!
So dull, so dull I feel.
The worldlings are bright and cheerful;
I alone feel gloomy and dismal.
The worldlings are smart and self-confident;
I alone feel disgusted and depressed.
Restless like the sea,
I drift along as if never able to settle down.
The multitude all have some worthy employment;
I alone am stubborn and worthless.
I alone differ from other people,
And love to draw nourishment from the Mother.
