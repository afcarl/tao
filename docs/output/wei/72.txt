When people no longer fear authority,
Great Authority will come to them.
Do not pen them up in narrow surroundings;
Do not make them weary of life.
Only when they are not wearied,
Will they cease to be weary.
That's why the Sage has self-knowledge,
But does not display himself;
He maintains his self-respect,
But does not feel high and mighty.
Forsooth, he rejects this and adopts that.
