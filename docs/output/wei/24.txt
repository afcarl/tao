He who stands on tip-toe will totter;
He who takes long strides is a poor walker.
He who likes to show off is not enlightened;
He who is prone to be self-righteous is not distinguished;
He who blows his own horn will acquire no merit;
He who extols himself is not fit to be a leader.
From the standpoint of Tao, it can be said:
"Eating excessive food or to walk with a burden
May be disgusting to creatures."
People possessed of Tao, therefore, reject them.
