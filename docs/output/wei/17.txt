The best rulers are not known to the people;
Then come those who are loved and praised;
Then those who are held in awe;
And lastly those who are despised.
When one's faith is inadequate,
It will not evoke faith from other people.
(Wise rulers) are wary and treasure their words.
When their task is accomplished and their work done,
All the people would say:
"We did it of our free will."
