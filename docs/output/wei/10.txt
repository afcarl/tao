In harmonizing your hun and p'o to embrace the One,
Can you concentrate without deviating?
In attuning your breath to induce tenderness,
Can you become like a new-born babe?
In cleansing and purifying your Mystic Mirror,
Can you make it free from all stain?
In loving the people and ruling the state,
Can you practice non-interference?
When the Heavenly Gate opens and closes,
Can you play the part of the Female?
When your light shines forth in all directions,
Can you ignore it with perfect equanimity?
To produce things and nourish them,
To produce but not to claim ownership,
To act but not to presume on the result,
To lead but not to manipulate, -
This is called Mystic Virtue.
