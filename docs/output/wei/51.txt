Tao produces all things;
Teh (virtue) rears them;
Material elements shape them;
Environmental forces perfect them.
That's why of the ten thousand things,
None does not honor Tao and exalt Teh.
Tao is honored and Teh is exalted,
Not in obedience to anyone's command,
But always in accord with Innate Freedom.
Thus while Tao produces things, Teh rears them,
Brings them up, develops them, perfects them,
Matures them, feeds them, and shelters them.
To produce but not to claim ownership,
To act but not to presume on the result,
To lead but not to manipulate -
This is called Mystic Virtue.
