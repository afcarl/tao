A man of the superior type resembles water,
Whose goodness lies in benefiting all things without contention,
And staying in places detested by the masses.
This makes him closely akin to Tao.
The goodness of his abode is its low location.
The goodness of his heart is its cavern-like hollowness.
Benevolence is the goodness of his offerings.
Sincerity is the goodness of his speech.
The goodness of his rule means peace.
The goodness of his dealings means competence.
His moves are good because timely.
As he is not disposed to contend,
He causes little resentment.
