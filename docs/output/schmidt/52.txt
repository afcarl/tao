The Light-abyss of the Tao is the Mother of all beings.
One who recognizes the Mother knows that he is a child of God.
Aware of his filiation he is on his way home.
Returning home he is lifted out of impermanence.
One who shuts his sense-gates and keeps silent lives without trouble.
But one who turns his senses outward and opens his mouth remains a slave of fear and death.
One who sees the origin in all is enlightened and who like growing things preserves his softness is strong.
One who loses the Inner Light loses nothing at the passing of his body,
Shining in Tao he is heir to the Eternal.
