The wise man hearing of Tao follows him.
Less wise men hearing of Tao turn to him and again turn away fro him.
Unwise men hearing of Tao laugh at him.
To fools the highest can appear but foolish.
To them the saying applies:
One enlightened by Tao looks dark advancing toward the Tao he seems to go backward.
His wisdom looks like error his being filled with Tao like emptiness.
His virtue looks useless his kindness like stupidity.
Because Tao is his support he seems to have no support.
Because he rests quietly within himself he has a disquieting effect.
Because he does not calculate he appears incalculable.
For the invisible cannot be grasped the infinite cannot be measured the eternal cannot be fathomed the primordial ground cannot be probed.
Although it is the origin and completion of all beings Tao is hidden and without a name.
