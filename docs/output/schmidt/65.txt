The old Sages doers of the Tao did not bring to men the multiplicity of learning but taught the simplicity of wisdom.
Because those knowing much are not sure of the goal and hard to lead.
One who tries to advance men by increasing their learning only leads them to perdition.
One who increases their wisdom serves their liberation.
One who considers both is a pointer to the goal and a model.
To be a pointer to the goal means to be a carrier of virtue.
Teh the fullness of virtue wells up from the depth flowing far surmounts ignorance and resistance leading all life to the sea of fulfillment.
