To advance the people and serve Tao nothing is better than serenity.
Serenity is caring foresight that guards against troubles.
It leads to abundance through being filled with Tao which is being superior to every situation.
To be superior means to be without limits to be without limits means to be owner of the empire To be owner of the empire means to be rooted in the limitless to be rooted in the limitless means to have duration.
Thus a firm foundation in the unfathomable immortality and the All-wisdom of the Tao grow out of serenity.
