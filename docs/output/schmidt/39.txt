All living things live by the Light of Oneness.
From it heaven receives its brightness earth its stability mind its insight space its fullness life its fertility and the leader his model.
If the Light of Oneness did not blaze in everything heaven would lose its brightness earth its stability mind its insight space its fullness life its fertility and the leader his model.
That is why the Sage lives consciously by the Light of Oneness like the crown of the tree out of the root.
That is why the leaders call themselves servants of the people remembering the onefoldness of the One guided by the spirit of Oneness.
