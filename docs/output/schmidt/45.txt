Right perfection seems imperfect yet abundance flows from it.
Highest fulfillment resembles emptiness yet remaining inexhaustible.
Highest straightness seems devious greatest wisdom sounds foolish and highest eloquence like stuttering ...
As motion conquers cold calmness conquers heat.
Serene action is the gauge of the Sage.
