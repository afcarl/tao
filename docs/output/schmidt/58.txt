The less administration the more beneficial is the harmony.
The more administration the more unpleasant confusion grows.
Trusting letting-go produces agreement and happiness.
Decisive attempt at control causes disagreement and misfortune.
One who does not give thought to what he does turns order into disorder fortune into misfortune enlightenment into blinding and dazzling.
How different is the Sage:
He is just without judging.
He guides without regulating.
He is a model without deforming.
He shines without blinding.
