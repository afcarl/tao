One should rule a country as one prepares a meal: with wisdom.
The more willingly one lets Tao do the less things are mismanaged and spoilt.
The less management the less pressure of forces.
The less forces are pressing the less trouble counter-pressure and resistance there are.
A sage does not press therefore he produces harmony and unity.
