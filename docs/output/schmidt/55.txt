One who is rich is Teh is like a child.
Insects and snakes wild beasts and birds of prey do not harm him.
His bones are weak his sinews tender but his grip is firm.
Unaware of his sex he nevertheless unfolds his creative power.
Constantly crying and babbling he does not get hoarse for he is one with himself.
To know of one's at-one-ness is being one with the Eternal.
To be one with the Eternal is to be enlightened.
Enjoying life is delusive happiness of separate existence.
Exhausting one's vital powers is delusive strength.
Delusive power of separate existence vanishes soon and decays since it is without All-Being without Tao.
What is Taoless has no duration.
