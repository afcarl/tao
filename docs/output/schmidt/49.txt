The Sage has no heart of his own His heart is beating in all.
Because his being breathes kindness He is equally kind to the good and the not-good.
Because his being breathes openheartedness he is equally open to the sincere and the insincere.
Devoted to the One He remains accessible to all As though they were his children Thereby winning their hearts.
