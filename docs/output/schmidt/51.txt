Tao gives life to beings Teh preserves them.
Tao shapes them Teh leads them to completion.
No creature therefore that does not revere Tao and love Teh - not in duty bound but of its own accord.
For Tao is the life and support of all their refuge and shield It makes them arise and grow mature and perfect themselves.
It acts without doing It fosters without demanding and guides without commanding.
Such is the mystery of Teh.
