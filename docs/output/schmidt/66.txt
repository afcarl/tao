The reason why streams and seas rule over rivers and brooks is that they are taking a low position.
Thus they remain lords of abundance.
Likewise the Sage:
He becomes a model for others by keeping in the background.
He leads them upward by keeping glow.
Thus he accomplishes outstanding things without being prominent and produces harmony without causing injury.
Because he does not oppress anybody everybody presses on to him because he is untiring one does not tire of him.
And because he is a master of non-action devoted to all nobody can harm him.
