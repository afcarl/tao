The Sage is living serene and inward Unwise men are busily striving outward.
The one finds gain of Self on the inner Path the masses fall prey to self -seeking on the outer paths.
Gain of Self leads to Tao Self-seeking leads to theft.
What some have too much others lack:
While the fields are lying waste the granaries are bare and want is spreading the possession-possessed build palaces arm themselves with weapons look fine and feast boast of their riches and do not see that their conduct is robbery their property stolen goods not possession of Tao!
