Easy it is to guide what is still at rest to forestall what is not yet manifest to bend what is still weak to master what is still small. Therefore, put order into things in their not-yet-being.
Guide in the bud what will later be awkward and unmanageable.
The strongest tree grows from a tiny rootlet the highest house rises from a clod of earth a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.
Interfering disturbs and spoils grasping causes disappearance and loss.
Therefore the Sage:
Not grasping he does not disturb and spoil.
Not interfering he does not lose.
The masses instead busily greedily interfering grasping for plenitude are at an end before completion ...
... They would not fail before the goal if they took care of the beginning as of the end of the small as of the great!
Follow the Sage:
Content with little he does not fail.
Heeding what is unheeded letting things ripen and biding his time he follows the wisdom of non-action and attains what belongs to him.
