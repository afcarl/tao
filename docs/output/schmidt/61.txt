The great place themselves low like streams rushing toward the sea which unites in itself rivers and brooks.
As woman conquers man through gentleness winning through surrender the great win the small through service and the small the great.
Service ensures conquest service makes superior.
When the great thus protect the small and advance them and the small willingly serve the whole all are served.
Greatness and oneness both thrive on surrender and are maintained through service.
