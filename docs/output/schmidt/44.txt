Name or self what is closer to you?
Being or having what is more to you?
Acquiring or letting go what is better?
If desires and attachment grow Disaster also increases.
For a gain in having means a loss in being.
One who gives up the perishable escapes perishing.
One who stops finds inner support and with it fullness fulfillment and duration.
