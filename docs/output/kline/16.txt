I try my best to achieve emptiness.
I hold firmly to stillness.
The myriad creatures rise together
And I watch them return.
The myriad things flourish
And each returns to its root.
Returning to the root is silence.
Silence is returning to being.
Returning to being is knowing the constant.
Knowing the constant is enlightenment.
Acting without knowing
The constant is harmful.
Acting while knowing
The constant is balance.
Balance leads to nobility,
Nobility to what is above,
What is above to the Way,
The Way to the eternal.
To the end of life
There is no danger.
