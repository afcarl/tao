He who knew the way of old
Was delicately subtle, mysteriously knowing,
Too deep to be understood.
Because he could not be understood
He can only be vaguely described:
Tentative, as if crossing a rushing river,
Alert, as if afraid of his neighbours,
Stiff, like a guest,
Fluid, like thawing ice,
Dense, like the un-carved block,
Empty, like the valley,
Turbid, like muddy water.
Who can be turbid, yet gradually clear?
Who can be still, yet gradually stir into life?
One who holds fast to the Way
Does not desire completeness.
Because they do not desire completeness
They can be worn, and not renewed.
