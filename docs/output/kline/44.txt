Which is dearer
Your fame or your self?
Which is more precious
Your self or possessions?
Which is worse
To gain or to lose?
So, great love
Leads to great sacrifice.
Great riches
Lead to great losses.
Know what is sufficient
And you won’t be humbled.
Know when to stop
And you’ll be free from danger.
Then you’ll last a long time.
