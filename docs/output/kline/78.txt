Nothing in the world is weaker or gentler than water.
But nothing exceeds it at conquering the hard and strong.
That is because nothing displaces it.
That the weak overcomes the strong,
And the gentle overcomes the hard,
Is something that everyone knows
But no one can put into practice.
So the wise say:
One who takes on himself the state’s humility
Is called a ruler worthy of its institutions.
One who takes on himself the state’s adversity,
Is called a ruler worthy of governing the realm.
True words
Seem perverse.
