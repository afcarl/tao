The Way is broad like a river.
How can it be deflected to left or right?
The myriad creatures depend on it for life
Yet it imposes no authority.
It does its work but claims no merit.
It feeds and clothes the people
Without claiming to rule them.
Free of desires it can be called ‘small’.
Yet as the myriad creatures turn to it,
And it does not claim to rule them,
It can be called ‘great’.
Because it never regards itself as great
It is capable of being great.
