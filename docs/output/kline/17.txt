The greatest ruler is one they know from of old.
The next is one they love and praise.
The next is one they fear.
The next is one they despise.
Where there is lack of faith,
There is a lack of respect.
Employ reticence, and care with words.
When the work is done and the task complete
The people will say: ‘It just happened.’
