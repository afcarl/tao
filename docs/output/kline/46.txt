When the Way reigns in the land,
Horses go back to ploughing the fields.
When the Way does not reign in the land,
War-horses breed on the frontiers.
There’s no crime worse
Than to pander to one’s desires.
There’s no sickness worse
Than not knowing what is enough.
There’s no greater catastrophe
Than the lust for gain.
Whoever knows what is enough
Will be happy with his fate.
