Those of old who were skilled in the Way
Did not use it to enlighten people,
But rather to maintain simplicity.
When people are difficult to govern
It’s because they’ve become too clever.
Governing the state by cleverness
Is a disaster for the state.
Not to govern a state by cleverness
Is a blessing for the state.
These are the givens.
To always understand the given,
Is called mysterious virtue.
Mysterious virtue is deep and profound.
When things return to the given, it returns.
And only then are things in complete accord.
