One who knows does not speak.
One who speaks does not know.
Block up the openings.
Shut the doors,
Blunt the sharp:
Loose the knots:
Dim the glare:
Follow old tracks.
This is called mysterious oneness.
You can’t possess it but can’t escape it.
You can’t benefit it or harm it.
You can’t honour it or debase it.
So it’s valued throughout the realm.
