The Way creates them.
Virtue raises them.
Things shape them.
Events mature them.
So the myriad creatures value the Way
And all honour virtue.
The Way is valued and virtue honoured
Not by force, but of its nature.
So the Way creates them and raises them,
Rears them and nourishes them,
Develops and matures them,
Feeds and shelters them.
It gives them life without possession.
It benefits them but asks no thanks.
It holds but imposes no authority.
Such is the mysterious virtue.
