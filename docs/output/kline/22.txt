Bowed down and so preserved.
Bent and then straightened.
Hollowed out then filled.
Worn away then renewed.
From the few achievement
From the many confusion.
So the wise grasp the One
And become a pattern for all.
Not shown, therefore apparent,
Not asserted, therefore known,
Not boasted of, therefore of worth,
Not contentious, so enduring.
It’s because the wise do not contend,
That no one can contend with them.
When the ancients said:
‘Bowed down and so preserved’
That was no empty saying.
It allows one to be preserved
To the end.
