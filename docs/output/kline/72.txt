When people don’t respect what is powerful
Things have the power to overcome them.
Don’t press down on their lives,
Don’t constrict their livelihood.
It’s because you don’t oppress them,
That they won’t weary of the burden.
So the wise know themselves,
But don’t make a display of themselves,
Love themselves
But don’t over-value themselves.
Taking the one, they leave the other.
