Do what involves no action.
Promote things without meddling.
Savour what has no flavour.
Make the small, great
And the few, many.
Counter harm with virtue.
Tackle the difficult while it’s still easy,
Address the great while it’s still small.
Difficult things have easy beginnings,
Great things have small beginnings.
Because the wise never try to be great,
That is how they achieve greatness.
Rash promises are rarely fulfilled.
Thinking things easy makes them difficult.
The wise treat things as if they were difficult.
And so are not overcome by difficulties.
