The Way has no name.
The un-carved block is small
But no one dares to claim it.
If the rulers could accept this
The myriad creatures would submit of themselves,
Heaven and earth would unite
And the sweet dew would fall.
The people could be dealt with
Without the making of laws.
When it is carved there are names.
When there are names it is time to stop.
Knowing when to stop
Keeps one from danger.
The worldâ€™s relation to the Way
Is like rills and streams
To the River and Sea.
