Only when man recognizes beauty as such does ugliness become reality.Only when man recognizes goodness as such does evil become reality. Because:being and nothingness began as one. Weight and weightlessness cannot exist alone. Distance and brevity prove each other and so do height and depth.Tune and voice abound together and past and present flow into one. Therefore the Sage remains in serenity whatever happens and silently does his teaching.As matters proceed, the Sage is not irritated. He works but wants no possessions.He acts but does not linger at single things. He creates but does not hang on a single word and because he is not tied to It, he will never miss It.
