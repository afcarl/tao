Who ascends the peak of Emptiness Will reach serenity. All Beings do see arise and then return whence they came. To return to one's origin means to acquiesce. To acquiesce means to have fulfilled one's destiny.To fulfill one's destiny means to have comprehended eternity. To comprehend eternity means to be enlightened. Not to comprehend eternity means to be subject of passions, and that is evil. Comprehending eternity makes one magnanimous. Magnanimity makes one just. To be just is Kingly. The Kingly is Heavenly. The Heavenly is the Spiritual. The Spirit is Immortal. And thus the ephemerally of the body can not harm us.
