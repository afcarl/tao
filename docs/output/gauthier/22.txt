What is half will become perfect. What is crooked will become straight.What is empty will be filled. What is old will be rejuvenated. Who has little, will receive in plenty. Who has much, will be deprived. The Sage embraces the All and becomes the Idol of the World. He does not look out for himself, and thus he glories. He does not please himself, and thus the world possesses him. He does not flaunt his accomplishments, and thus the world venerates him. He strives not to be on top, thus he will be elevated.He does not attack, and the world around him is still. Truly: Everything flows freely into the seeker of perfection.
