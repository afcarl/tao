Serenity is wiser than superficiality, dignity is master of turbulence.The sage does not step off the path of serenity. He is not distracted by unruly passions, angered in contemplation nothing can perturb him. Woe,if the ruler of the land considers himself more important than the realm.His follower loses, who succumbs to frivolity, His dominance loses, who's driven by passions.
