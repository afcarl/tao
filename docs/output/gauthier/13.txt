Forgiveness is to be shunned like a disgrace. Ambition for honors is burden like the body. Forgiveness denigrates; one lives in hope to obtain,in fear of losing it. Ambition for honors is a burden like the body. The body is burdensome. If I had no body I would be burden free. Who honors the community as himself is worthy of her. Who loves the community as himself makes her his own.
