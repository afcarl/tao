All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, an dare completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation.This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. Thus it is that theta produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth,nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them and overspreads them. It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them though their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doings; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;-thesis called mysterious operation.
