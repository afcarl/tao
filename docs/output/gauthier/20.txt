Give up the Book learning and you may win serenity. The difference between yes and certainty, how meaningless -but that between good and evil, how immeasurably great. The world venerates Book learning, I can not participate.Perhaps this is limitless delusion. The people glory in their festivals,as if on top of a great tower. I alone am silent, as no message had reached me of there events, like a child that yet can not smile, deserted, homeless.They all overflow, I alone seem empty. O my foolish heart: I am confused.They appear unperturbed, I alone step in the dark. They appear exuberant,I alone am sad, sad as the sea. Torn apart like a vagrant. They are imbued with usefulness, Only I am clumsy like a peasant, I am different from them,Yet I am on my knees before Creative Nature.
