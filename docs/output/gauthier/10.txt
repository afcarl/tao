Who finds union of mind and heart will reach immortality. Who mastership passions and turns them to deeds of kindness, is greater than a King.Who cleanses and clears his soul becomes free of vice. Who governs in love and justice is a benefactor even in mere contemplation. He is fearless should even the heavens come down. Who has insight in the depths of Times,may have not knowledge, yet supreme wisdom. To work and conserve, to work without greed for possessions, To work and let others use the produce,To encourage and not dominate, That I call deep virtue.
