An experienced wanderer needs neither guideposts nor paths. A good mathematician needs no counting board. A good orator needs no false arguments.A good locksmith needs no key. The Sage is a good helper of man and never despairs. Such is his enlightenment. The Sage is the teacher of the confused,and values his pupil. Who does not honor his teacher, Who does not value his pupil, lacks wisdom in spite of his knowledge. Such is true Spirituality.
