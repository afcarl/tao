We search for it yet see it not; it is the invisible. We listen fort, yet hear it not; it is the untouchable. Its trinity is inseparable.We recognize it only as one, inner bound.
Its distance is incomprehensible, its depth can not be fathomed. Eternally creative, it can not be defined. It goes back to Nothingness. It can be called: The incomprehensible Mysterious. You walk towards it and find not even its Beginning. You follow it and there is no End. Who understands the Spirit of the old Sages masters his own time, and threw them the very root of all time. Such is the continuum of the Spirit.
