He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who's (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunts sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will temper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' (Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly of distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profiter injury; of nobility or meanness:-he is the noblest man under heaven.
