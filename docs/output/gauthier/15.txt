The great sages of antiquity were wise and intuitive. It is difficult comprehend their depth. They were cautious like men who are crossing an ice covered river, Cautious like people wary of certain neighbors. Reserved as only guests are. Relenting like melting ice, plain as uncut timber,open like a valley. Dark as deep water. Who can as they interpret the turbulent threw serenity? Who can as they threw their own lives revive the dead souls?Who is filled with serene thoughts desires no other fulfillment, Who desires no other fulfillment is not attacked by novelties of the day. Such cancan be of simple status yet reach perfection.
