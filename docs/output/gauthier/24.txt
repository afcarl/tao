No one can stand solid when on his toes. No one can run with spread legs. Who admires himself will not be venerated. Who is pleased with oneself,the world will not praise. Who praises himself, merits little appreciation.Who pushes for the top, will not be elevated. For the Spirit he is a leftover,an odd growth on the body. The people will look upon him in disdain, And those who live by reason will not emulate his like.
