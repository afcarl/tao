Whoever advises the ruler in the spirit of Tao will avoid rule by force of arms: force begets force. Where armies are arrayed against each other,grow thistle and thorn. Wars are the parents of hunger and misery. The Sage wants peace, nothing else, he aspires never for conquest. He is victorious in restraint, victorious with arrogance, victorious without presumption,victorious without demonstration and offense. Whoever seeks military adventures will perish in them. Such is the fate of rapaciousness. Such is the fate of materialism.
