Whoever wishes to rise by conquest will fail. The true goal in life's spiritual and can not be conquered by force. The aggressor destroy sit. The conqueror loses it. Mankind is forever in change, Some run ahead,soon they fall back. Some are powerful, soon they weaken. Some are fiery,soon they are cold. Some are victorious, soon defeated. The Sage is not moved by earthly ambitions, he avoids self aggrandizement, he avoids self elevation.
