Not to give preference to the high and mighty will deter the envy of the people in order. To demonstrate no desire will give them peace in their hearts. Therefore, when the Sage governs, he frees his people of passionate wishes and offers serenity to their souls. The Sage weakens greedy curiosity and strengthens the backbone of the upright. So does he master true serenity in good government.
