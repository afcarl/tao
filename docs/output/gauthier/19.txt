Pretend not to saintliness, nor to smartness and the people will prosper!Talk not of Humanity nor of absolute Justice and the people will return to family devotion. Give up the great profits as well as your Luxuries and there will be fewer thieves and robbers. In all these things the pretense's harmful. Therefore one must retain the lasting virtues: To retain Simple goodness, humility and moderation.
