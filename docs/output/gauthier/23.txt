To speak sparingly is the natural course. A whirlwind lasts not throughout the morning. A spray rain lasts not the day. Such it is between heaven and earth. And such it is with man. Who dedicates himself to reason will become one with reason. Who dedicates himself to virtue, will become one with virtue. Who gives to evil will become one with evil. Who is one with reason, will be embraced by reason. Who is one with virtue, will be embraced by virtue. Who joins evil will be one with evil. Who has no faith, will never inspire faith.
