Thirty spikes run into one hub: yet in the emptiness of the wheel lies its essence. From clay a jar is formed: yet in its emptiness lies the essence of the container. Rooms are made by cutting windows and doors into the walls, yet in its emptiness lies the essence of the room. The visual matter can be observed but it is the Invisible that constitutes its true being.
