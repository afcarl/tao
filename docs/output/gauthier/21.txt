True Virtue is born of Reason, The essence of reason is unfathomable and incomprehensible. The faces of reason can not be discerned, The world that appears in reason, no one knows how, Impenetrable is the darkness where the heart of Being dwells, This being is Truth itself and Faith itself.From eternity to eternity, they will never perish. Who saw the beginning of All. The beginning All, one knows only threw the perennial Spirit.
