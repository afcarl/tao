Generosity is like the Waters. It is a balm to all beings and rejects none. It dwells in places shunned by the masses, and therefore close tithe Spirit. Generosity seeks out in dwellings the humble, in thinking depth,in giving love, in speaking truth, in ruling justice, in work knowledge in all our deeds the proper time. Generosity does not reject and therefore will not be rejected.
