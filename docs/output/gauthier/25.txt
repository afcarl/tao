There is a Being of Perfection, incomprehensible. It ever was, still and formless, before they came, stars and earth. Unchangeable and alone,unencumbered, whirling threw Time. I name it, Creative Nature. It has no name, shall I call it Tao, the Spirit? Or the substance, the infinite?The infinite in unlimited attributes? The great Distant, that forever returns!Tao is great, the Heavens are great. The Universe is great. May the ruler be in tune with the Spirit. Four things are great in the world, May the ruler be one of them. Man is under the law of the earth, the earth under the law of the Universe, The universe under the law of Tao and Tao is the Law itself.
