The Spirit is free of things yet inexhaustible in its impact. The Spirit's like the creator of all being. He dulls the sharp meanness that clarifies all confusion. He unifies in kindness. He knows the oneness of man withal dust. The Spirit is eternal. I know not when it began. It almost seemed to have preceded the Lord Itself.
