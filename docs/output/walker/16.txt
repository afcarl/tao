Work toward emptiness and openness. Cultivate stillness. Breathe harmony. Become tranquility.
As the ten thousand things rise and fall, rise and fall, just witness their return to the root.
Everything that flourishes dissolves again into the source. To dissolve back into the source is to find peace. To find peace is to recover your true nature. To recover your true nature is to know the constancy of Tao. To know the constancy of Tao is insight.
Insight opens your mind. An open mind leads to an open heart. Openheartedness leads to justice. Justice is an expression of divinity. Divinity is oneness with Tao.
Oneness with Tao is freedom from harm, indescribable pleasure, eternal life.
