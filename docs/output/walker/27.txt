A good runner leaves no tracks; A good speaker makes no slips; A good planner doesn't have to scheme.
The best lock has no bolt, and no one can open it. The best knot uses no rope, and no one can untie it.
Thus the master is always good at saving people, and doesn't abandon anyone; Always good at saving things, and doesn't waste anything. This is known as "Following the light."
What is a good man but a bad man's teacher? What is a bad man but a good man's charge?
It doesn't matter how smart you are if you don't have the sense to honour your teachers and cherish your responsibilities. This is an essential teaching of Tao.
