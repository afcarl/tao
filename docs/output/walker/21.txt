The greatest virtue is to follow Tao, and only Tao.
You might say, "But Tao is illusive! Evasive! Mysterious! Dark! How can one follow that?" By following this: Out of silent subtle mystery emerge images. These images coalesce into forms. Within each form is contained the seed and essence of life. Thus do all things emerge and expand out of darkness and emptiness.
Because its essence is real and evident in the origins of all things, the name of the Tao has survived since the beginning of time.
How can I know the circumstances of the origins of all things? Exactly by this phenomenon.
