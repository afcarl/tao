Which is more precious, fame or health? Which is more valuable, health or wealth? Which is more harmful, winning or losing?
The more excessive your love, the greater your suffering. The longer you hoard, the heavier your losses.
Knowing what is enough is freedom. Knowing when to stop is safety. Practice these, and you'll endure.
