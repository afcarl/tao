Those who are courageous out of daring are killed. Those who are courageous out of love survive.
The first is harmful, the second beneficial. Heaven prohibits some things, but who knows the reason? Not even the sage knows the answer to this.
This is the way of heaven: It doesn't contend, but easily overcomes. It doesn't speak, but always responds. It can't be summoned, but comes of its own volition. Utterly without haste, it plans for everything.
The net of heaven is vast. Though its meshes are wide, nothing slips through.
