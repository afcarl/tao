If people fear your power, then you don't really have any.
Leave them alone in their homes. Respect them in their lives, and they won't grow weary of you.
The sage knows herself, but doesn't dwell on herself; Loves herself, but no more than she loves everyone else. She adopts the concerns of heaven as her own.
