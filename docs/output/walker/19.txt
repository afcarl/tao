Give up religiosity and knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Discard morality and righteousness, and the people will return to natural love.
Abandon shrewdness and profiteering, and there won't be any robbers or thieves.
These are external matters, however.
What is most important is what happens within: look to what is pure; hold to what is simple; let go of self-interest; temper your desires.
