Knowing others is intelligence; knowing the self is enlightenment.
Conquering others is power; conquering the self is strength.
Know what is enough, and you'll be rich. Persevere, and you'll develop a will.
Remain in the center, and you'll always be at home. Die without dying, and you'll endure forever.
