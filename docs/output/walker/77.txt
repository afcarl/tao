The way of heaven is like the bending of a bow. What is high up gets pulled down. What is low down gets pulled up.
Heaven takes from what has too much and gives to what doesn't have enough. Man is different: he takes from those who have too little and gives to those who have too much.
Who has a genuine abundance to give to the world? Only a person of Tao.
He acts without expectation, accomplishes without taking credit, and has no desire to display his merit.
