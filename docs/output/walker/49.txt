The sage has no set mind. She adopts the concerns of others as her own.
She is good to the good. She is also good to the bad. This is real goodness.
She trusts the trustworthy. She also trusts the untrustworthy. This is real trust.
The sage takes the minds of the worldly and spins them around. People drop their ideas and agendas, and she guides them like beloved children.
