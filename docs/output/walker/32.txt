The primal eternal Tao is an unnameable simplicity. Though small, there is nothing under all of heaven that can subjugate it.
If a leader abides by it, all beings are naturally drawn to him.
Heaven and earth come together in harmony and sweet rain falls everywhere. People cooperate voluntarily, without any instruction.
Tao in the world is like streams flowing into the sea.
