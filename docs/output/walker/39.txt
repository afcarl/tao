From ancient times these have attained oneness with Tao: Heaven attained oneness and became clear. Earth attained oneness and became peaceful. Spirits attained oneness and became strong.
Valleys attained oneness and became full. Beings attained oneness and became fertile. All are what they are by virtue of oneness.
Heaven without clarity would fall. Earth without peace would explode. Spirits without strength would dissipate.
Valleys without fullness would dry up. Beings without fertility would die off. Sages without wholeness would stumble and fall.
Humility is the root of greatness.
Those in high positions do well to think of themselves as powerless, small and unworthy. Isn't this taking humility for the root?
Attain honour without being honoured.
Don't shine like jade, or chime like bells.
