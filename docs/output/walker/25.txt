Something mysterious and perfect existed before even heaven and earth were born. Silent, immeasurable, standing alone and unchanging, moving without end or exhaustion, it is the mother of the known and unknown universe.
I don't know its name, so I call it by an alias: Tao. Forced to describe it, I only say, "It is great."
That which is great continues. That which continues goes far. That which goes far returns.
Therefore Tao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, a person of Tao is great. These are the four greatnesses in the universe.
A person of Tao follows earth. Earth follows Heaven. Heaven follows Tao. Tao follows its own nature.
