Can you marry your spirit and body to the oneness and never depart from it?
Can you ride your breath until your entire being is as supple as the body of an infant?
Can you cleanse your inner vision until you see heaven in every direction?
Can you love the people and govern them without conniving and manipulating?
Can you bear heaven's children in all that you do and are?
Can you give the wisdom of your heart precedence over the learning of your head?
Giving birth, nourishing life, shaping things without possessing them, serving without expectation of reward, leading without dominating: These are the profound virtues of nature, and of nature's best things.
