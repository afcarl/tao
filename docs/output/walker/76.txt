At birth a person is soft and yielding, at death stiff and hard.
All beings, the grass, the trees: alive, soft, and yielding; dead, stiff, and hard.
Therefore the hard and inflexible are friends of death. The soft and yielding are friends of life.
An unyielding army is destroyed. An unbending tree breaks.
The hard must humble itself or be otherwise humbled. The soft will ultimately ascend.
