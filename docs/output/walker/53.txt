Because I have a little wisdom, I choose to walk the great path of Tao and fear nothing except to stray from it.
The great way is very smooth and easy, but some people are fond of getting sidetracked.
When a ruler's palace is full of treasure, the people's fields are weedy and their granaries are empty.
If the ruler wears fancy clothes and his house is full of weapons, if his table is laden with extravagant food and drink and everywhere one looks he has more wealth than he can use, the ruler is a robber and thief. This is not in keeping with Tao.
