The greatest perfection seems imperfect, yet its usefulness is endless. The greatest fullness seems empty, yet its usefulness is inexhaustible. Great straightness seems flexible.
Great skill looks clumsy. Great eloquence sounds awkward.
Movement triumphs over cold. Stillness triumphs over heat. Clarity and tranquility set the whole world in order.
