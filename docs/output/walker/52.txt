The origin and mother of everything in the world is Tao.
Know the mother and you can know the children. Having known the children, return to their source and hold on to her. Abiding by the mother, you are free from danger, even when your body dies.
Don't live for your senses. Close your mouth, close all the body's openings, and reside in the original unity. In this way you can pass your life in peace and contentment.
Open your mouth, increase your activities, start making distinctions between things, and you'll toil forever without hope.
See the subtle and be illuminated. Abide in gentleness and be strong.
Use your light, and return to insight. Don't expose yourself to trouble. This is following Tao.
