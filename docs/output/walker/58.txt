When the government is dull and sleepy, people are wholesome and good. When the government is sharp and exacting, people are cunning and mean.
Good rests upon bad. Bad hides within good.
Who knows where the turning point is? Whether government or person, if you aren't tranquil and honest, the normal flips to the abnormal, the auspicious reverts to the bizarre, and your bewilderment lasts for a long time.
Therefore the sage does what is right without acting righteous, points without piercing, straightens without straining, enlightens without dazzling.
