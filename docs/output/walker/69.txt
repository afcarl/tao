In conflict it is better to be receptive than aggressive, better to retreat a foot than advance an inch.
This is called moving ahead without advancing, capturing the enemy without attacking him.
There is no greater misfortune than underestimating your opponent. To underestimate your opponent is to forsake your three treasures.
When opposing forces are engaged in conflict, the one who fights with sorrow will triumph.
