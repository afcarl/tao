Be done with knowing and your worries will disappear. How much difference is there between yes and no? How much distinction between good and evil?
Fearing what others fear, admiring what they admire-nonsense.
Conventional people are jolly and reckless, feasting on worldly things and carrying on as though every day were the beginning of spring. I alone remain uncommitted, like an infant who hasn't yet smiled: lost, quietly drifting, unattached to ideas and places and things.
Conventional people hoard more than they need, but I possess nothing at all, know nothing at all, understand nothing at all.
They are bright; I am dark. They are sharp; I am dull. Like the sea, I am calm and indifferent. Like the wind I have no particular direction.
Everyone else takes his place and does his job; I alone remain wild and natural and free. I am different from others; my sustenance comes directly from the Mother.
