Allow yourself to yield, and you can stay centered. Allow yourself to bend, and you will stay straight. Allow yourself to be empty, and you'll get filled up. Allow yourself to be exhausted, and you'll be renewed. Having little, you can receive much. Having much, you'll just become confused.
Therefore the sage embraces the oneness and becomes a pattern for the whole world.
She doesn't display herself, so she becomes illuminated. She doesn't justify herself, so she becomes distinguished. She doesn't boast, so she is recognized. She doesn't claim credit, so she advances and endures.
She doesn't contend, so no one can contend with her.
"Yield and you can stay centered"- Is this saying meaningless? Stay whole, and all things return to you.
