Heaven and Earth are not sentimental; they regard all things as dispensable.
The sage isn't sentimental, either; He views all forms as ephemeral and transitional.
Tao is like a bellows: empty but inexhaustible. The more you move it the more it makes.
Too much talk about it evaporates your understanding, though. Simply stay at the center of the circle.
