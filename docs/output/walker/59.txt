In governing people and serving heaven, there is nothing better than moderation.
To be moderate is to follow Tao without straying. To follow Tao without straying is to become filled with good energy. To be filled with good energy is to overcome all things. To overcome all things is to know that all things are possible.
She who knows that all things are possible is fit to govern people.
Because she is one with the mother, her roots go deep, her foundation stands firm, her life lasts long, her vision endures.
