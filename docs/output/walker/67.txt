Everyone under heaven says that my Tao is great, but inconceivable. It is its very greatness that makes it inconceivable! If it could be conceived of, how small it would be!
I have three treasures to hold and protect: The first is motherly love. The second is economy. The third is daring not to be first in the world.
With motherly love one can be courageous. With economy one can be expansive. With humility one can lead.
To be courageous without motherly love, To be expansive without practicing economy, To go to the front without humility - this is courting death.
Venture with love and you win the battle. Defend with love and you are invulnerable. Heaven's secret is motherly love.
