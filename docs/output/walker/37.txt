Eternal Tao doesn't do anything, yet it leaves nothing undone.
If you abide by it, everything in existence will transform itself. When, in the process of self-transformation, desires are aroused, calm them with nameless simplicity.
When desires are dissolved in the primal presence, peace and harmony naturally occur, and the world orders itself.
