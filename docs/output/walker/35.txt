Stay centered in the Tao and the world comes to you: Comes, and isn't harmed; Comes, and finds contentment.
Most travelers are drawn to music and good food.
When Tao is talked about, the words can seem bland and flavourless. Looked at, it may not catch the eye. Listened to, it might not seduce the ear. Used, it can never be exhausted.
