Nature is sparing with speech: a whirlwind doesn't last all morning; a rain shower doesn't last all day.
What causes these? Heaven and earth. If heaven and earth can't make something famous endure, how could man?
Concentrate on Tao and you'll experience Tao. Concentrate on power and you'll experience power. Concentrate on loss and you'll experience loss.
If you won't trust, you won't be trusted.
