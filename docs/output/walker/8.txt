The highest good is like water which benefits all things and contends with none. it flows in low places that others disdain and thus it is close to the Tao.
In living, choose your ground well. In thought, stay deep in the heart. In relationships, be generous. In speaking, hold to the truth.
In leadership, be organized. In work, do your best. In action, be timely.
If you compete with no one, no one can compete with you.
