Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish.
If it's done in accordance with Tao, nothing bad will happen. Guide the world with Tao, and evil won't be a problem.
Not that it won't be around, but it won't find an opening, it can't harm anyone.
The sage doesn't harm anyone, either. When there's no harm on this side, no harm on that, goodness flows back and forth like water.
