The sea is king of the valleys and streams because it is willing to be beneath them.
One who wishes to guide the people should be humble in her speech toward them. One who wishes to lead the people must learn the art of following them.
The sage is above the people, but they don't feel her weight. She stays ahead of the people, and no harm comes to them. She has the affection of the whole world.
Because she contends with no one, no one can contend with her.
