Govern a nation by following nature. Fight a war with unexpected moves. Win the world by letting go. How do I know this? From seeing these:
The more prohibitions there are, the poorer people become. The more weapons there are, the darker things become.
The more laws there are, the greater the number of scoundrels.
Therefore the sage says: I take no action, and people transform themselves. I love tranquility, and people naturally do what is right.
I don't interfere, and people prosper on their own. I have no desires, and people return to simplicity.
