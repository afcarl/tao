The great Tao floods and flows in every direction.
Everything in existence depends on it, and it doesn't deny them. It accomplishes its work without naming or making claims for itself. Everything in existence is clothed and nourished by it, but it doesn't lord over anything.
Aimless, ambitionless, it might be called "small."
Everything in existence returns to it, and still it doesn't lord over anything. Thus it might also be called "great."
Because it has no desire to be great, it can achieve greatness.
