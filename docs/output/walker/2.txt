When people find one thing beautiful, another consequently becomes ugly.
When one man is held up as good, another is judged deficient.
Similarly, being and non-being balance each other; difficult and easy define each other; long and short illustrate each other;
high and low rest upon each other; voice and song meld into harmony; what is to come follows upon what has been.
The wise person acts without effort and teaches by quiet example.
He accepts things as they come, creates without possessing, nourishes without demanding, accomplishes without taking credit.
Because he constantly forgets himself, he is never forgotten.
