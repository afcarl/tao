A man who tiptoes can't stand. A man who straddles can't walk.
A man who shows off can't shine. A man who boasts of his achievements has no merit.
A man who brags will not endure.
To a person of Tao, these things are excess food and superfluous behaviour. Because nothing good can come of them, he doesn't indulge in them.
