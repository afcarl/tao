Those who wish to use Tao to influence others don't rely on force or weapons or military strategies. Force rebounds.
Weapons turn on their wielders. Battles are inevitably followed by famines.
Just do what needs to be done, and then stop. Attain your purpose, but don't pres your advantage.
Be resolute, but don't boast. Succeed, but don't crow. Accomplish, but don't overpower.
Overdoing things invites decay, and this is against Tao. Whatever is against Tao soon ceases to be.
