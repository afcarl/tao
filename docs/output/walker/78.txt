Nothing under heaven is as soft and yielding as water. Yet for attacking the hard and strong, nothing can compare with it.
The weak overcomes the strong. The soft overcomes the hard. Everyone knows this, but none have the ability to practice it.
Therefore the sage says: One who accepts the dung of the nation becomes the master of soil and sustenance. One who deals with the evils of the nation becomes king under heaven. True words seem paradoxical.
