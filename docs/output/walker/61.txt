A great country is like a low-lying land into which many streams flow. It draws powerful energies to it as a receptive woman draws an eager man. The feminine can always conquer the masculine by yielding and taking the lower position. In this way she becomes as low-lying land: in time, everything comes her way.
Therefore a great country can win over a small country by practicing humility. A small country can also win over a great country by practicing humility.
One wins by willingly taking the lower position. The other wins by willingly acknowledging its lower position.
The great country wants to embrace and nourish more people. The small country wants to ably serve its benefactor.
Both accomplish their ends by yielding.
