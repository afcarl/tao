Making sure that mankind lives in peace is a trifle
Where righteousness is the main guide, delusions won't last
Not that there will be no delusions at all
But the people will be less susceptible to them
Delusions damage people, and a wise man shows them it's so
Therefore a wise man is a threat to delusion,
But no threat for mankind
Therefore they will become wise, too
