The wise of old were profound and acute
People thought of them as unfathomable
Because they where unfathomable, I'll try to sketch their way of living:
They seemed cautious, like people who cross a wintry river
They seemed irresolute, as if danger was threatening everywhere
They seemed dignified, as if they where guests
They seemed natural, like raw wood
They seemed empty, like a valley
They seemed opaque, like muddy water
How can one make muddy water clear?
Stagnation will settle the mud down and the water will become clear
Let everything happen as it happens and you will come to rest
The head of the wise is empty, he does not search for anything and expects nothing
He is empty, everlasting, youthful and not caught in time
He is perfect
