Can you empty your head and lastingly lose yourself in Creation?
Can you live up to your nature and become like a child?
Can you purify the doors of perception and see clearly again?
Can you love your fellow man and serve mankind disinterestedly?
Can you go in and out of the narrow gate without any effort?
Can you be in the world without being possessed by it?
Can you realize that you can't know anything and therefore understand everything?
Nature brings forth everything and feeds everything
She brings forth but possesses nothing
She does everything disinterestedly and asks for nothing
She leads but demands nothing
That is what people call the incomprehensibility of Nature
