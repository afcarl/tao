One who understands that quarrels will never solve anything,
Won't start them anymore and prefers to wait
He rather takes a step back or retracts
That's what people call winning by losing
Showing strength without impressing
Standing firm without starting a fight
Nothing is more disastrous than underestimating your enemy
One who underestimates his enemy exposes oneself to danger
Therefore he who's driven by compassion
Is always the winner in a conflict
