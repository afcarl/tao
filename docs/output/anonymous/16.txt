One who has an empty head is satisfied, One who is satisfied has an empty head
All creatures exert and come to rest
All plants grow to maturity and come to rest
That final rest is what's called being done; completion
Returning to nature is what's called eternal life
Living in the present is called being enlightened
One who is not enlightened lives in confusion and misery
One who lives according to his nature understands everything and is forbearing
One who is forbearing is righteous
One who is righteous is royal
One who is royal is divine
One who is divine knows oneself
One who knows oneself has eternal life
One who has eternal life is not afraid to die
