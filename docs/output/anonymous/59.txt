To get mankind to live in peace requires a full detachment
Because only one who is detached knows how to live truthfully
Letting go of everything before dying makes one live righteously
One who lives righteously knows no trouble
For one who knows no trouble, life is unbounded
One who is unbounded, considers the world as his home
One who feels united with creation, lives happily ever after
Then you'll be rooted again and you'll stand firmly
Only like that will you live happily ever after and understand everything
