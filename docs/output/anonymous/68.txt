One who fights for peace is non-violent
A true fighter is unshakeable
A true victor does not argue
A true leader is the least
That's what people call “non-violent defensibility”
And that's how one gets the people on his side
That is called “living according to your nature”
That is the perfection of which the wise of old spoke
