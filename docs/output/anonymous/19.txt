Dispose yourself of worldly knowledge and cleverness
And it will only be good for mankind
Stop pretending to be nice and fair, but be it
Then people will love each other unconditionally
Dispose yourself of the work of your hands and stop serving your self-interest
And there will be no thieves or robbers anymore
But these three things won't be enough
What it's really about is turning back to simplicity
Giving up your selfishness and not wishing for anything
