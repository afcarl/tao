When people no longer fear death
How can one threaten them with it?
But if people are afraid of death and other people threaten to kill them

When they infringe upon the law
Well, who is still going to break the law?
But there is only One who commands life and death
Since people started to decide about life and death themselves

They have actually taken a place on that One's chair
Then they behave like sorcerer's apprentices

Who assault the works of their master,
With disastrous consequences for themselves
