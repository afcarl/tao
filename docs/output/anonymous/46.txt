If men lived by their nature
Horses would gallop in the open air
But since men got civilized
Battle horses standing at the frontier
There is no bigger curse than dissatisfaction
Nothing more disastrous than being discontent with life
Nothing more fatal than being eager for possessions
One who knows the peace of satisfaction, is always satisfied
