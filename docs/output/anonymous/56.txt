Those who have experienced the Mystery don't speak about it
Those who do speak about it have not experienced the Mystery
Don't try to speak about the Unspeakable
That which cannot be seen, heard, felt or tasted
The shapes fade
The edges weaken
Confusion disappears
The light brightens
The unrest is extinguished
That's what they call a “Mystical Experience”
Neither affection nor hate can move him
Profit nor loss will touch him
Honour nor disgrace will harm him
Therefore he is the world's noblest man
