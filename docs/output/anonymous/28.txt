One who knows his strength and yet stays mild, is the least
Whoever is the least, is balanced like the open-minded child he once was
One who has fathomed the lie is an example for the world
One who became human again is an example for the world
One knowing oneself, is a knowing among the ignorant
One who has returned to his original purity, realizes his grandeur
One who has abandoned his origin, becomes civilized
To the wise man they act like actors
