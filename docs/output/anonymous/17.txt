Of the wise of old, people only knew that they existed
Later on they loved them and admired them
Thereafter they got scared of them
And finally the wise were seen as despicable
One who can't trust oneself, can't trust another
How cautious were the first with their words
They proceeded so cautiously that when they where done
The people thought they did it themselves
