Humans come and go
Their bodies as the seat of life
Their bodies as the seat of death
Humans get old and decay
Why is that?
It's because they are already dead, but think that they're living
There have been stories told and written about people who had found true life
And wandered around the earth
Not afraid of tigers or rhinos
Those who avoided weapons and violence
And lived in harmony with all creatures
Therefore no creature felt threatened by them
And no weapon could harm them
Why is that?
Because they were only living
And that's where there is no room for death
