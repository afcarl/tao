When people think `this´ is beautiful, they must think `that´ is ugly
When people say `this´ is good, than they have to say `that´ is evil
This is Inevitable
People create a false reality out of the real one
Hard and easy are relative
Long and short depend upon each other
High and low are determined by a position
Sound and voice need one another
Before and beyond assume a point of view
That's why a wise man acts without intentions
And won't decide for others what to do
He'll let anything happen as it happens
He won't consider what he does as his own merit
And only therein is he praiseworthy
