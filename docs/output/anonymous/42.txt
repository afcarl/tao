The unspeakable gives birth to one
One to a second
And out of the second arises the third
The third brings the whole creation to life
Everything is carried by the dark and comes to light
The breath of Emptiness creates order
People hate to be alone, unimportant and useless
And yet that is what a true man takes pleasure in
One who becomes smaller, becomes bigger
One who becomes bigger, becomes smaller
I only tell what everybody already knows:
One who lives in a complicated way, dies in a complicated way
That is what it's all about
