With laws men rule a state
With ruses people make war
Without laws and without ruses you'll have a peaceful mankind
How do I know this?
Well, because of the following:
The more orders and prescriptions, the more defiant the people become
The more arming, the bigger the chaos
The more knowledge and science, the more machines and artificiality
The more rules and decisions, the more thieves and robbers
Therefore a wise man says:
I don't do anything, and the people change spontaneously
I take rest, and the people become honest spontaneously
I don't make an issue of anything, and the people find wealth inside themselves
I don't want anything, and the people return to simplicity
