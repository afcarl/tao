Nothing in life is so soft and compliant as water
Nothing is stronger in breaking what is hard and strong
Nothing can exceed it in doing this
Weak overcomes strong
Soft overcomes hard
Nobody knows this
And no one practices it
Therefore the sage says:
One who is the least in the world, will be the greatest in life
One who carries the sorrow of the world, is the greatest among mankind
It sounds odd, but it's true
