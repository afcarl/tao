When I possess True Knowledge
I will stroll on the right and simple road
I will avoid side paths
Because the straight road is easy to walk
But most people love the narrow side paths
The residences of the rich are neat and clean
But the fields of the poor are filled with weeds
And their granaries are empty
The elite wear generously-decorated and expensive clothes
Sharp swords hang on their waists
They stuff and they swill
They lose themselves in possession and wealth
They flaunt their stolen gear
Now, isn't that conscienceless?
