All those artificial colours blind people's eyes
All that man-made music deafens people's ears
All those various flavours dull our taste
Horse races and hunting drive people crazy
The desire for scarce goods
Hinders people from going on the straight and simple path
Therefore the wise finds his satisfaction
In feeding himself and then he won't exhaust his eyes
Therefore he does this and leaves that
