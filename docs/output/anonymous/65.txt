The former sages, who travelled along the straight and simple path
Brought the people wisdom instead of knowledge
When people know much, unity is impossible to keep
That's why science disturbs the togetherness of men
And wisdom guards that togetherness
One who understands this
Understands that wisdom and knowledge are in conflict with each other
Once you understand this, you'll be wise
And you will turn back to simplicity
And feel one with everything and everybody
