Perfection seems unfinished to this world
But it never perishes
Fullness is empty to the world
But it's inexhaustible
That which is correct, is incorrect to the world
Wisdom seems foolish to the world
Telling the truth a disgrace
Like movement chases away coldness
And rest cools down
Purity and calmness show one the right direction
