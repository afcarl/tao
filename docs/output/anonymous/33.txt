One who sees trough the other is clever
One knowing oneself is wise
One who conquers the other is powerful
One conquering oneself is inviolable
One who is satisfied is rich
One that wants a lot is busy all the time
One who stays oneself, is a four-square fellow

One who dies before dying, lives in the present forever
