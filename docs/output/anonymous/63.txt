Act without intention
Stop labouring
Just enjoy life
One who doesn't honour something small
Isn't worthy of something big
No more eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth
Turn to them your other cheek
Discover that what seems complicated is in fact very simple
See the grandeur in what seems insignificant
Don't turn simplicity into complexity
Living purely is simple
But people have made it complicated
So one who's wise will never make trouble
And therefore he can move mountains
One who promises a lot is hardly ever trustworthy
One with a lot of blinkers on will bring to pass lots of troubles
But one who is wise looks before he leaps
Therefore he won't start at all
And because of that he knows no trouble
