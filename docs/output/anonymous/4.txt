That which maintains the Creation
Is like an empty barrel that's inexhaustible
It is like a fathomless emptiness, filling the whole Creation
Its sharpness brings about curves
Its angles dissolve
It dims its light
It restrains its touch
How pure and calm it stays, like deep waters
I don't know its origin
It seems like it is even older than that by which it is brought forth
