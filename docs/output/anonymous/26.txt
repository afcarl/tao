Heavy is the source of that which is light
The unmoved mover is the origin of all movement
Therefore a true human being can be in motion all day
Not because it is him moving himself
But because he just floats on life
Like a spectator he enjoys the wonderful and sparkling creation
Why should he, as the centre of the world,
Consider himself minor to that world?
One who knows his grandeur, comes loose of the world
One who wanders restlessly in that world, has lost oneself
