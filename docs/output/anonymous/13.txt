Watch out for gratitude and criticism
Honour and misfortune are as disastrous as having character
What does that say?
Watch out for gratitude and criticism?
Watch out for gratitude, because it originates from submission
Watch out for criticism, because it comes from superior power
Therefore, watch out for gratitude and criticism
What does it mean that honour and misfortune are as bad as having character?
Disasters come over us because we've got something to lose
If we had nothing to lose, which disasters could still strike us?
Therefore: to him who considers himself just as worthy as the world,
Mankind can entrust the world
And to him who loves himself and the world just as unconditionally,
Mankind can entrust the care for the world
