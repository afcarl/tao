A righteous and blissful life is approachable only when you follow your conscience
The conscience is invisible and impalpable. How can you follow it?
It speaks through images, like shadows in the dark
But how faintly and obscurely
The conscience is hidden but it carries the essentials of everything inside
The true life-force shelters itself inside conscience
Everything people know deeply inside is stowed within the conscience
It has always been there since the beginning, with many different names
The conscience separates truth from lie
How do I know all this?
My conscience has told me that it's so
