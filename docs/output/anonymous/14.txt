We look at it but we do not see it and we call it the invisible
We listen to it but don't hear it and we call it the inaudible
We grope at it but never touch it and we call it the untouchable
The invisible, the inaudible and the untouchable come together in one
There is no light when it rises
There is no darkness when it descends
Continuously, constantly, but it cannot be put into words
And it returns to nothing
This is what they call the form of the formless, the image of the invisible
People call it indefinite and impalpable
You won't see it from the front
You won't see it from behind
One who lives after their original conscience, lives in the present
And understands everything that has ever been
That is living according to nature
