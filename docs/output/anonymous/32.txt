The Unspeakable is eternal and is not to be spoken of in words
Just like a rough piece of wood, it's not useful to anyone
If leaders were an example of true living
Everyone would join his true nature at the same time
The heavens would dew and the clouds rain justice
And without human intervening
That altogether would benefit every single thing that lives beneath the firmament
But when discord is born
Everything must have a name
Keep in mind that when everything has a name,
You'll have to stop all that
Because one who stops will bounce off danger
Compared to the twisted tributaries of mistake
The straight and simple road is like a powerful stream
