It is better to carry an empty barrel than a full one
Sharpen a knife until it is razor-sharp and it won't last long
When a house is filled with valuables, it is impossible to guard
When wealth and ambition make one arrogant, it will lead to a fall
When fame and success menace you, pull back
That's the only road to true bliss
