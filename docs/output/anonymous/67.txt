In life I am great, but to the world I am a failure
In my grandeur, I am different from all the rest
And that is exactly therefore the reason I am great
If I would be like the rest, I would be just as unimportant and insignificant
I have three treasures I cherish:
The first is compassion
The second is austerity
The third is modesty
Thanks to my compassion I can be brave
Because I am austere I can be unselfish
Because I am modest I can lead the way
But one who abandons his compassion and yet wants to be brave
One who renounces austerity and yet wants to be unselfish
One who stops being modest and still wants to be important
Won't make it far
One who fights with compassion, will conquer
Because he doesn't need to defend himself, he's invulnerable
The Unspeakable will protect him with its compassion
