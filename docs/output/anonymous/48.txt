Gathering knowledge makes life more complicated each time one gathers
Gathering wisdom makes life easier each time one gathers
Each time, more and more simple until simplicity is reached
Just by leaving, one man can achieve everything
One who wants nothing anymore, doesn't feel the need to do a thing, has conquered oneself
One who wants a lot has to do a lot and is as a slave to oneself
