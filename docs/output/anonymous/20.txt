When you unlearn what you have learned, you will be free from worries
We've learned that there is but little difference between yes and yes , but
That there is a big difference between good and evil
That we have to be scared of what others are scared of
What an endless pack of bullshit
Everybody is restless and excited like they are watching a soccer game
Only I am at rest and unwound and I don't have to do those things and like a child, I want nothing
I'm not attached to anything and don't have to go anywhere in particular
The others already have so much and still they want more
Only I seem to have lost everything
They think I'm crazy and confused
People seem to be bright and clever
And think that I am naive and foolish
It looks like I blow with the wind and don't seem to find rest anywhere
The others seem to know so much
And in their eyes I am nothing but a boor
I am only different because I live according to my nature
