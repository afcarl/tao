Dissension becomes unity
The impure becomes pure
The voids shall be filled
The old becomes new
One who has nothing, receives everything
One who has a lot, receives nothing
One who is wise cherishes simplicity and in this way he is an example to the world
He is modest and therefore he excels
He doesn't have to prove himself and that's why people trust his words
He has nothing to defend and therefore he is invulnerable
So the aphorism of the wise of old “The imperfect becomes perfect” is true
The perfect considers the world as his home
