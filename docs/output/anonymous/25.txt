Before Creation revealed itself
There was already something, perfect but formless
Quiet and unchanging
Ubiquitous and inexhaustible
People might consider it as the creating force of everything that is
I cannot describe it, but I just call it Tao
If I have to interpret it , I would name it “The Universe”
With that Universe I mean that which extends itself everywhere
The infinitely extending and returning
Therefore the creative is great and the creation great and so is a wise man
So there is a trinity of greatnesses and one of them is the true human being
A true human being follows his nature, nature and all its eternally unchanging laws
The laws of nature are the eternal order of the Universe
The order of the Universe is well-founded by the Unnameable
