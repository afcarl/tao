When a human being is born, it's supple and weak
When it dies it's stiff and strong
Everything that's alive (take a look at grass and trees for example)
Is supple and flexible
And when they die they are shriveled and parched
Therefore hardness and inflexibility are companions of death
And suppleness and softness, companions of life
That's why a rigid troublemaker will never win
And an inflexible tree is doomed to death
Inflexibility and power won't get you very far
Suppleness and softness get you everywhere
