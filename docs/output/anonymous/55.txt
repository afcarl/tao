A true human being is like a new-born baby
Wasps and scorpions won't sting it, snakes and adders won't bite it
Raptors and wild animals won't attack it
Its bones and muscles are soft and flexible, yet it has a pretty tight grip
Sex and libido are strange to it, but its little penis already is able to stiffen
That is because its nature is not yet disturbed by thoughts
It can yell all day without getting a hoarse throat
Because everything is still perfectly in balance
Experiencing that balance is called “living in the eternal present”
Living without past or future is called “being wise”
Every attempt to extend life is pointless
One who wants to control his life, restrains oneself
It is unnatural that things wither
That which is unnatural will come to an early end
