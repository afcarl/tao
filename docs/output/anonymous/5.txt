The Creation does not pretend to be friendly
It treats all things impartially
One who is wise doesn't act friendly
All people are equal to him
The Universe is like bellows
Although empty, it fills continuously
The harder it works, the more it brings forth
The more you talk about it, the wearier you get
Therefore, you'd better stick to what really matters
