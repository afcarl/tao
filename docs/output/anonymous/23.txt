One who knows oneself doesn't need a lot of words
A whirlwind doesn't last all morning
A shower doesn't last a whole day
Where do wind and rain come from?
They sprout from nature
If nature doesn't endure its rains and storms
Then why should a human being have to talk so much?
So the One who follows his conscience, coincides with his conscience
One who lives an exemplary life, will be an example
One who loses oneself, doesn't know who he is anymore
One who finds oneself, finds bliss
One who loses oneself, loses true life
One who does not trust oneself, will not be trusted
