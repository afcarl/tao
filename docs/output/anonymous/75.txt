People starve
Because the wealthy enrich themselves off other people's backs
That's why people starve
People cannot be kept under control

Because their leaders don't know what they're doing
That's why people cannot be kept under control

People want to die
Because they don't want to live this way
Therefore people want to die
Only the one who is not afraid to live,
Is not afraid of dying
