Having guts and being reckless will lead to death
Having guts and being cautious saves life
The first is useless; the other useful
Only one who is wise understands the course of things
Therefore he won't intervene
It is easy to infringe upon the eternal laws of nature

But they always triumph
They don't speak, yet they do answer
They don't yell, yet everybody hears them
Like a net, the original order protects the Universe
Though its meshes seem wide, nothing can come through
