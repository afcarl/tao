When mankind lives in peace,
There will be no superiors and inferiors
It is like a big river,
In which all side currents have come to rest
The wildness comes to rest in peacefulness,
Because it is calm and most lowly
One who is the least by his disarming simplicity,
Is therefore appealing to his fellow men
And so it's a benefit for both of them
So one who looks big, has to become small again
