One who stands on tiptoe, doesn't stand firmly
One who walks in a forced way, doesn't come far
One who is vain, doesn't shine
One who justifies oneself, isn't credible
One who brags, will be unmasked
One who works one's way up, humiliates oneself
To a wise man these are nothing but follies
One who lives righteously and honestly, refrains oneself from these things
