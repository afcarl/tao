The fewer rules and laws there are, the happier mankind will be
The more rules and laws, the more there will be of dissatisfaction and conflicts
Someone's wealth comes at the expense of someone else's poverty
Misery for one is the result of someone else's wealth
When will this ever stop?
One who is wise is righteous and won't play that game
He is just and fair and will never hurt anybody
He shines, but does not blind
