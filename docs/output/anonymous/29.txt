One who thinks he is capable of improving Creation, will not succeed
Creation is perfect and cannot be corrected
One who intervenes in nature, will only destroy nature
One who tries to control nature, will lose to nature
Because everything is what it is and everything happens as it happens
At times it is warm and then it is cold
At times there are storms and then it's calm
There is growth and then there is lying down
A wise man lets himself flow along with the streams of life
