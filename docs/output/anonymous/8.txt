A perfect human being is like the water
That benefits all things and competes with nothing
It stays in places which others despise
But in this way it follows its origin
In his heart the wise cherishes simplicity
In contact with others he is amiable
In his words he is reliable
In his leading he is peaceful
In what he does he is competent
He does everything at the moment it needs to be done
He won't fight
And therefore he is impeccable
