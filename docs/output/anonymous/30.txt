One who advocates a righteous world, uses no violence
Because One who uses violence, provokes violence
And where discord rules there is chaos
And after times of conflict lean years will follow
The righteous one does what he can and forces nothing
Is not proud about what he achieves
Does not brag about what he achieves
Does not boast about what he achieves
He only does what he does because that's all he can do
And he never uses power or violence
Civilizations which have reached their peaks
Usher in their decay
Civilizations are unnatural
And what's unnatural, will perish
