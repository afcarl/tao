Everything inclines towards the original balance
It's the bliss of true men
It's a sanctuary for the untruthful
But people flaunt themselves with flattery
They only do nice things in exchange for gratitude
Everybody does that so why shouldn't you?
Therefore the people shout with joy when a new leader comes on the scene
And let themselves be fooled by pomp and circumstance
It's wise not to participate in this
Do you know why the former wise people considered simplicity so important?
Because they experienced that, one who seeks will find
And that the truth sets one free from past and future
Therefore simplicity is most important in this life
