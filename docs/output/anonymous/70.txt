My words are easy to comprehend
And easy to bring to practice
Yet no one in the world wants to surrender to them
And no one feels capable of living according to them
My words have an origin, my way of living a principle
But because the people do not dare to see this

They are not able to understand me
There are only a few who understand me and to them I am most precious
One who is wise therefore acts unnoticed, but remains oneself
