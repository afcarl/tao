Why are the seas and rivers the biggest among all waters?
Because they are located on the lowest places
Therefore they are the biggest
So one who is wise among fools must be the least
And therefore he is the greatest
But fools won't consider him as a threat
They just don't understand him and take no notice of him
Because he doesn't fight and argue with anybody, he is indisputable
