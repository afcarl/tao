A wise man has no opinion at all
Therefore he can easily put himself in someone else's position
He accepts everybody and everything for what it is
In spite of any behaviour
He trusts the honest and the unfair
And naturally they become fair-minded
He trusts the reliable and the unreliable
And naturally all will become reliable
A wise man feels one with all people
They are all just as precious to him
They look and listen to him
And all are as children to him
