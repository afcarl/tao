The Unspeakable makes all things appear
The active force determines their nature
Their nature determines their shape
The circumstance determines their final appearance
Therefore all creatures,
With the exception of erring mankind, honour the Unspeakable
And live according to their natures
This is all a natural process
And nobody rewards them for it
The Unspeakable makes them live, feeds them, makes them grow
Fulfils them, gives them peace, supports and guards them
It makes them live, but never forces them
It takes them along the stream of life, but does not possess
It makes mature, but does not control
That is an unfathomable mystery
