True virtues are not from this world,
Therefore they are true virtues
The so-called “virtues” in this world
Serve only self-interest
Therefore those are not true virtues
One who only serves the general interest, is truthfully adequate
One who is called charitable in this world,
Expects thankfulness in return
One who is called honest in this world,
Has a hidden agenda
Those who have been adapted to this world
Demand that others do the same
And if not they threaten you and get angry
Therefore, when people stray from the straight and simple road
Then they start to act virtuously, but they are not virtuous
They pretend to be honest, but they are not fair
They act decently, but they are not decent
Civilization is just a thin crust across unfaithfulness and dishonesty
It is also the source of disorder and chaos
A wise man never hides behind a mask
He trusts what's inside of him, not in appearances
Therefore he rejects appearance and embraces the essence
