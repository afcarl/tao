For one who beholds the perfect arrangement of things
Everything falls in its rightful place
Nothing can harm him, and rest and peace will fall to him
Along the way there are travellers who yield music and feasts
Because the road to self-knowledge is acrid and unpleasant
Not pleasant to face
Painful to hear
But giving an inexhaustible strength
