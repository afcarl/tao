When people have forgotten what to be afraid of,
They will live in vague fear
Why do they come to terms with this miserable way of living?
Why don't they see the beauty of life?
Why are they so scared of escaping their rut?
One who is wise understands this, and won't flaunt it
He enjoys it but doesn't consider it as his own merit
He abandons his old way of living and embraces true life
