A true traveller never takes a beaten road
A true speaker has an answer to every question
A true researcher has solved all problems
A story that holds water needs no confirmation
Nobody can refute a watertight story
One who sees how perfectly everything is connected with everything
Needs no theories or opinions, and no one can bring him to doubt
That's why a true human being is a teacher of others
And he loves his fellow men unconditionally
Therefore he is shepherd of the whole creation
And respects every thing that lives and grows
People call this: “The light that has become human”
Therefore a true human being is a mirror for the untrue
And it's his task to point out their imperfections
One who is scared to take a look at oneself and does not love oneself
Might know a lot of things, but he is blind
It seems odd, but it's true
