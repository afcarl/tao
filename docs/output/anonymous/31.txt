How ingenious weaponry may seem to be, though it will always be disastrous rubbish
Everybody hates it
A righteous man saves himself from it
While a true man will not soil his hands with it
A fighter grabs for it
Weapons are not good for meek people
They bring nothing but trouble
One who is wise will never ever use a weapon
Because peace and quietness are more precious to him
He doesn't enjoy victory
Because one who enjoys victory
Enjoys his fellow men getting killed
And one who enjoys their fellow men getting killed
Will never find peace in oneself
Prosperity is considered as a personal merit
Misfortune on the other hand is considered as an ironic freak
Victory is the merit of men
And defeat the blame of the commander
But victory and defeat only brings losers
