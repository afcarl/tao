One who is rooted in this unfair world,
Won't be easy to unsettle
One who holds on to that world, can't let go
Therefore their children will suffer until the third and fourth generation
But one who follows his conscience
Will lead an impeccable life
One who takes care that his fellow men follow their conscience,
Makes them flourish
One who takes care that his neighbours follow their conscience,
Makes them examples for everybody else
And when all of mankind follows its conscience,
There shall be a paradise on earth
Look at yourself if you want to understand yourself
Discover the connections and patterns in the way your nearest relations,
Cities and the nations, get on with each other
Because what's on a small scale, is on a big scale, too
How do I know it is that way?
Because I've done this myself
