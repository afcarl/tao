When the most sincere hear about the road to self-knowledge,
They will devote themselves to bringing it into practice
When the fairly sincere hear about the road to self-knowledge
They will only get out of it what suits their purposes
When the hardened hear about the road to self-knowledge
They will roar with laughter
If they didn't roar, it would not be true
Therefore there are some aphorisms to it:
The road to light appears to be dark
Going forward sometimes feels like going back
The way to the simple road is a hard way to take
But also:
The greatest personality turns out to be vain
The purest white turns out to be grey
The most righteous proves to be unfair
Kindness seems but a thin layer
With the truth one can go in all directions
Like a square circle
Like an inexhaustible barrel
Like singing without words
Like a sculpture with no shadow
In that way the road is hidden and not captured in words
Only the road to self-knowledge has a beginning and an end
