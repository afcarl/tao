The Universe is everlasting
The reason why it is everlasting
Is because it doesn't exist for itself
Therefore it can last
Therefore a wise man behaves as the least
And because he is least, he is the greatest
He is detached and therefore he is safe
Couldn't it be possible that he is perfect,
Just because he is disinterested?
