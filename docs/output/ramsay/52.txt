Every living thing
Comes from the Mother of Us All:

If we can understand the Mother
Then we can understand her children;

And if we know ourselves as children
We can see the source is Her.

And, well, if your body dies -
there's nothing to be frightened about.

If you keep your mouth shut
And stay inside -
Then you'll live a long time.

If you blurt out
What you think to everyone,
Then you won't last long.

Value littleness. This wisdom.

To bend like a reed
in the wind
- that is real strength.

Use your mind, but stay close to the light
And it will lengthen its glow
right through your life.
