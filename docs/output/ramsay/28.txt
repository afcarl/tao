Understand the thrust of the yang -
But be more like the yin in your being.

Be like a valley
that parts to its stream;

Be like a stream
for the earth . . .

And channel it,
so it flows - to the sea.

Be newborn - be free of yourself,
be humble,
be earthy,
be a valley for the whole world.

Be a channel for the energies here -
weave them in a true and practical way
so they can link up with the Way and become one again.

Oneness generates everything:

When the sage rules in the light of it,
He rules everything.

A wise man never tries to break up the Whole.
