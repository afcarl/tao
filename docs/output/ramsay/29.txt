If a rules behaves as if he's invented the world,
He will do no good at all.

The earth is a sacred vessel -
and it cannot be owned or improved.

If you try to possess it, you will destroy it:
If you try to hold on to it - you will lose it.

Some are leaders, then, and other follow.
Some drift like the wind, and other drive hard.
Some are thick-skinned, and other have no armour;
And some are the destroyers, and others they destroy.

So now you know why

the sage abandons greed,
all false charm -
and every last iota of pride.
