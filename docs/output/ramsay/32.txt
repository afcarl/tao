The Tao has no name
it is a cloud that has no shape.

If a ruler
follows it faithfully,
then every living thing under heaven will say yes to him.

Heaven and earth make love,
And a sweet dew-rain falls.
The people do not know why,
But they are gathered together like music.

Things have been given names from the beginning.
We need to know when we have enough names: this is wisdom.

At the beginning of time
The sage gave names to everything - see, and unseen.

A ruler who walks the Way
Is like a river reaching the sea
Gathering the waters of the streams
into himself,
as he goes.
