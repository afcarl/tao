When you gaze at something but see - nothing;

When you listen for a sound but cannot hear it;

When you try to grasp it and find it has no substance

- then these three things
That go beyond your mind
Are moulded together in the One.

Its surface doesn't shine, but nor is its base dull.

Given this, it is only knowable as a no-thing.

Confront it - it has no head;

Come behind it, and it has no tail...

If people could follow the ancient way,
then they would be masters of the moment.

And if you know this way
then you have seen the timeless way of the Tao.
