Without going anywhere,
you can know the whole world.
Without even opening your window,
you can know the ways of Heaven.

You see: the further away you go, the less you know

The sage doesn't need to travel around:
Why? Because he can still understand.

He sees without needing 'to see',
He never does anything, and yet
it all happens.
