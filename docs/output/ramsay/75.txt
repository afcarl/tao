Why are the people hungry?
Because you crush them with your taxes:
That is why they have nothing.

Why are the people angry?
Because you endlessly impose your laws:
That is why they can't take any more.

And why aren't they scared of death?
Because you are voracious and you want everything.
So what have they got left to lose?

Those who only have a little
really know how to value life.
