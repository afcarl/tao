'When the Tao runs the world,
the horses work the farms.'
Without Tao

the horses are led into war along the borders.

You see, if people want more and more
it can only lead to disaster.

Greed

is the seed of apocalypse -
it is the rocket-fuel of selfishness:
me, me, me!

If people could only be glad with all they have,
if they only knew it, they'd be happy.
