Why is the sea
the king of a hundred tributaries?

Because everything comes down to it -
So it is kingly
By this name.

So a sage that wants to rule the people must be below them.
If he wants to be their leader, he must be behind them.

If he has no desire to control

then the people will not feel oppressed;

And if he stands before them for their own sake, and not his

they will not harm him.

Trusted by everyone, no one will tire of him.

What is his secret?
He never competes.
So there is no one else but him.
