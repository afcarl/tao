When ruling the world and serving Heaven,
The sage uses simplicity in everything he does.

Simplicity comes from letting go of what you want.

If you've been true to yourself earlier in your life
Then te builds up in you like a well that never fails.
Nothing is impossible, then - and nothing can stop you.
And if you have no limits - then you can hold the State.

If the sage can find the Mother of a Nation
Then he will govern for a long, long time.

All this comes form his rootedness in the Tao,
The Tao of Ages, the Mountain of Vision And Of Wings.
