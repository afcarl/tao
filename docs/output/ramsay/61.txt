A great country is like a low-lying estuary -
It is a place where all the lesser streams mingle and merge.

Everything comes together there . . .

And a woman wins her man: how does she do it?
By using the power of her yin like an anchor,
A still deep bowl
into which it all flows.

This is passiveness.

So if a great country takes a low place
It wins over the trust of a smaller state;
And if a small country shows humility
It wins the trust of a whole nation.

And it's like this: those who want to win must yield,
And those who are yielding should stay where they are.

A great country needs to grow:
A small one needs protection.

That way, everyone gets what they want -
when the greater learns to be below.
