A person who's brash and fearless will die,
A person who is cautious will survive -

These two are right, and they are wrong
Heaven looks down on both
and who know the truth?

So even the sage admits some things are beyond him.

The Tao of Heaven
doesn't struggle, but it wins through

It doesn't ask
yet it always hears the answer -

It doesn't demand
yet things come, because they want to be

It has no desires
and yet everything works out as if planned.

And though the Net Of Heaven is wide
Not even the tiniest whisper escapes it.
