The sage who goes by the way leaves no traces
The sage who speaks the true law never slips up -
He never calculates what profit he can make from what he does.

He keeps out thieves with wisdom! He's never robbed -
He makes sure the rules are binding, then no one can undo them:

He is aware of everyone, leaving no one uncounted;
He cares like a parent, and wastes nothing.

This is the essence of harmony.

So, a good man is a model for a bad one
And, misguided, he is touched by his goodness.

Not to follow a teacher here
Or to love his precious message
Is to lose the Way, however clever you are -

This is the essence of the matter.
