The Tao pours out everything into life -
It is a cornucopia that never runs dry.

It is the deep source of everything -
it is nothing, and yet in everything.

It smooths round sharpness
and untangles the knots.

It glows like the lamp
that draws the moth...

Tao exists, Tao is
but where It came from I do not know.

It has been shaping things from before the First Being,
from the before the Beginning of Time.
