The sage does nothing, and so he never fails -
He holds on to nothing, and so he never loses . . .
Whereas the rest of us always seem to mess up our lives
just at the moment when we seem to be succeeding!

That's why the sage wants nothing for himself.
He doesn't want precious things or possessions.
What is he? A Student OF The Unknowable,
so he doesn't make mistakes like the rest of us
but always tries to help us to be true to who we are
without ever standing in our way.

And so he says: do things wu-wei, by doing nothing
Achieve without trying to achieve anything -
Savour the taste of what you cannot taste

Make a small thing great, and the few into many -
Take on the largest things when they're still small,
Start the hardest things while they're still easy.

It's always the person who thinks things are easy
that finds them the hardest in the end.

The way he sees it: everything's potentially tricky,
so he never ends up out of his depth.
