If all I know is a fraction -
then all my only fear is of losing the thread . . .

The Great Way is easy
but people are forever being taken down sidetracks.

They look after the palaces,
But ignore the fields!

The granaries are empty
- but they wear wonderful clothes!

They go about with arms
and gorge themselves on find food and drink.

How rich they are -
and they have stolen it all from the poor.

They are the robber barons of now -

This is not the real Tao!
