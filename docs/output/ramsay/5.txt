Heaven and earth are not like humans.

The Tao does not act like a human.

They don't expect to be thanked
for making life,
so they view it without expectation.

Heaven and earth are like a pair of bellows:
they are empty, and yet they can never be exhausted.

Work them, and they produce more and more

- there's too much talking, it's really better to stay quiet.

There are too many laws, when all you have to do
is to hold on to the centre.
