Hold yourself back from filling yourself up,
or you'll tip off your stand.

You can hammer a blade until it's razor-sharp -
and in seconds, it can blunt.

You may amass gold and jade in plenty
but then the more you have, the less safety...

Are you strutting your wealth like a peacock?
Then you've set yourself up to be shot.
You bring about your own disaster
Because you've got too much.

Let go, when your work is done:

That is the Way of Heaven.
