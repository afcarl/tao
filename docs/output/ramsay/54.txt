What is build on rock
cannot be pulled down;
What is held lightly
can never be lost.

Meditate on virtue within yourself,
and you will find the benefit of virtue.

Use it as the ground for the family,
and your virtue will last for generations.

Take it as your guidance for the village,
and the place will blossom for years to come.

Use it to guide the nation,
and that nation will create abundance.

Be guided by it for the Whole,
and it will flood its way over the world.

So, look at someone else as you would yourself
And treat other families as you would your own;
See your community in other communities,
Think of all countries as part of your being
And treasure the world as the round centre of everything.

How can I see the would like this?
Because I have eyes.
