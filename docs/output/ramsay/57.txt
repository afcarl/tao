To rules a nation, use justice
To win a battle - cunning,
But remember: wu-wei is the only true way.
How do I know this?
I will explain:

The more rules you have, the more unhappy people are;
And the more weapons there are, the worse things happen.
The more we want luxuries, the more we abandon simplicity -
And the more laws you pass, the more we will break them.

So the sage says: I do nothing, and the people come together;
By leaving them alone I let them be on the path -
By not using my power, they become rich in themselves.
And if I want to nothing, they will return to the essence of their being.
