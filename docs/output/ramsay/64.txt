When everything is peaceful, don't forget the danger;
When things are safe, don't lose your edge -
A brittle thing can break
easily
And a small thing fragment.

So 'act before it happens'.
'order things before chaos breaks out'.

A great tree which takes a crowd to span its base
Started from being a tiny seed;
And a tower nice sections high began in the ground.

A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step.

To act as if you know it all is catastrophic:
and if you try to control it

you will stare into your empty hand.
