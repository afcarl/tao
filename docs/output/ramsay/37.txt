The Tao goes on forever
wu-wei - doing nothing
And yet everything gets done.

How? It does it by being,
And by being everything it does.

If people and rulers go by this
then every living thing will be well.

And if parts still want to separate
the true leader will use

the centrifugal weight
of this original
unnameable Oneness.

It is simple:

If no one wants anything for themselves
then there can be peace

and all things will know peace

the way music
ends in peace.
