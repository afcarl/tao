The guide who walks the Way
Never resorts to violence.

The sage goes to the left side of the Emperor;
while the man of war goes to the right.

Weapons are terrible things -
and no sage will have anything to do with them,
unless there is no alternative.

The sage wants peace and quiet.

No victory is free of grief,
and so to celebrate one is to glory
in the death of innocent people.

No one who revels in death like this
can be true to the Way
or is fit to rule in our world.

At glad times, the place of honour is on the left:
after disaster, it is on the right.
So in the army, the officers stand to the left
while the general stands to the right.

So the whole things is staged like a funeral.

When a war kills many, we must mourn for them -
And if you win the war, you must grieve it.
