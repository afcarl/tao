Everything streams from the Tao,
Everything is nurtured by Te
Everything is made out of substance.

Everything is created by the Tao of Nature
- and from everything on earth that surrounds it.

So every living thing
should bow to the Tao,
the Tao and its Virtue

because they are what it is.

Everything that breathes comes from the Tao,
And the Virtue feeds and takes care of it.

They grace things without possessing them,
They benefit everything but ask for nothing back,
They give themselves into everything without seeking control.

This is the essence
of the original intention.
