Listen, give up trying to be so learned
And things will be a lot easier.

Is there really any difference between a yes
And a no said insincerely?

Is there really much of a difference
Between being angry and pretending not to be?

What the people are afraid of I also need to fear.

And what do most people do? They go
looking for a good time.

They go looking for fool's gold
and auspicious signs.

Only, you see, I am lazy
And I don't give a damn about fame or money.
I am like a child who cannot bring himself to smile.

What do that people want? Money and things.
And yet I find I have nothing, and I don't care.
I am as unambitious as any fool.

Most people seem to be bright and sharp
And how do I feel? Like a blunted sword.

The people, the people are like waves of sea
And I am drifting between them wherever they are blown.

And the people, the people are so busy!
But I have nothing to bother about. I am a bumpkin, a lout.

I am different, I am strange.
I live for the Mother.
