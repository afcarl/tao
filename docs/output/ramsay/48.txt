Usually, people read because they want to know -
but the more you study the Tao, the less you want knowledge.

And as you want less and less, you come closer to not-doing.
Wu-wei - this is the way to get things done.

The best way to run the world
is to let it take its course
- and to get yourself
out of the way of it!
