The Tao of Heaven
is like the tensing of a bow:

- what is above
is drawn down,

- and what's below
is drawn up,

- what has plenty is drawn from
and is given to what doesn't have enough.

The Heavenly Tao takes from those who have too much,
And it gives to those who have little or nothing.

Ah, but the human way is different.
Even the wealthiest leech the poor
So they can have even more.

What kind of person is it
Who has more than they need
And so gives it out, and gives it freely?

Only a being that is filled with the Tao.
