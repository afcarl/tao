If you know what it is, don't talk it away:
If you do, then you don't understand.

Hush, keep it in, and your doorway shut -
Steer clear of sharpness and untangle the knots.

Feel your lightness and let it merge with others,
This, we say, is our basic oneness.

The sage who does this doesn't have to worry
about people called 'friends' or 'enemies',
with profit or loss, honour or disgrace -

He is a Master of Life, instead.
