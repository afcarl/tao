The Body of The Tao
is a mist beyond your eyes

Tao of No Body,
and yet within it is All Creation.

Like a seed in the dark, and a dim light
And from it, comes everything.

Root, stem, leaf . . . its essence is in everything.

Everything is born from this Tao
I say so, and I can prove it!

From the beginning of time until now
the Tao is eternal because it is Creation.

How do I know the Tao is the root of all being?

Because
I know this.
