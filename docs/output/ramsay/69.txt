There is a saying, you know, which soldier have:

'I never use my force before my enemy uses his.
I'd sooner go back a foot than advance an inch.'

This is called going forward without moving,
Rolling up your sleeve without showing your arm -
And by not, you defeat him without apparently doing anything.

This is like being armed, but no one sees what you have.

Never think your enemy is feeble. That's disastrous.

If I do that, I'm bound to lose all I have!

So, you see, when the battle begins
It is the one who seems weakest that will win.
