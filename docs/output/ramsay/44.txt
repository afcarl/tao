What really matters most,
Your image or your soul?
What do you care about
You money, or your life?
What's actually the best,
Making it - or losing?

If you pour all your energy into one thing,
You're sure to harm the rest of your being
And if you invest it all in profit -
You'll end up losing the whole lot.

If you're not always wanting, you can be at peace.
And if you're not always trying to be someone
You can be who you really are

and go the whole way.
