Heaven and earth are enduring.

The universe can live for ever,
because it does not live for itself.

And so both last - outliving themselves.

The sage guides his people
by putting himself last.

Desiring nothing for himself,
he knows how to channel desires.

And is it not because he wants nothing
that he is able to achieve everything?
