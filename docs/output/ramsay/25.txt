Before the world was

And the sky was filled with stars . . .

There was a strange, unfathomable Body.

This Being, this Body is silent

and beyond all substance and sensing.

It stretches beyond everything
spanning the empyrean.

It has always been here, and it always will be.

Everything comes from it, and then
it is the Mother of Everything.

I do not know its name. So I call it TAO.

I am loath to call it 'greater than everything',
but it is.

And being greater, it infuses all things
moving far out and returning to the Source.

Tao is Great,
Tao, the Great!

It is greater than Heaven,
Greater than the Earth -
Greater than the king.

These are the four great things,
and the ruler is the least of them.

Humanity is schooled by the Earth;

Earth is taught by Heaven,

And Heaven is guided by the Tao.

And the Tao
goes with what is absolutely natural.
