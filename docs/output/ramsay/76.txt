When a body is alive, it is soft and supple
- it is cold and rigid when it dies.

When plants are alive, they are tender and trailing
and burnt and brittle when they're dead.

What's iron hard is what is dead, then
And what is fluid and sensuous and rippling is alive . . .

And that is why a huge army
With all its strength and complacency will be defeated:
Like a great tree
axed down.

Everything hard and strong will come down,
And everything soft
shall rise, shall overcome.
