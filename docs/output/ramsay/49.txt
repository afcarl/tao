'The sage is never opinionated,
He listens to the mind of the people.'

I am kind to people when they are kind to me.
I am kind to them even if they hate me.
Virtue - te - is its own reward.

I trust those who trust me,
I also trust those who have no faith in me:
What I give, I receive.

A sage is self-effacing and mindful of offence.
He sets himself as his own example.
How shall I treat you, my son?

Like a child.
