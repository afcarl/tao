The Great Tao goes everywhere
past your left hand and your right -
filling the whole of space.

It is breath to every thing, and yet it asks for nothing back;
It feeds and creates everything, but it will never tell you so.

It nurtures all things
without lording it over anything.

It names itself in the lowest of the low.

It holds what it makes,
Yet never fights to do so:

that is why we call it Great.

Why? Because it never tires to be so.
