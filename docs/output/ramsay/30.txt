The Emperor's advisors will never recommend violence
if they know what the Tao is.
If you use the strategy of warfare
it can only result in revenge.

After troops have tramped by
only weeds and nettles grow in the broken ground.
There can be no harvest,
and everyone is left starving.

If you need to take action, only do what is necessary.
Never abuse your power.

And if you're successful, don't be smug;
If you are a success, don't trumpet it -
If you think you've won, never overdo it -

Those who use force soon end up without it -

And this is not the Way.

And if you do not follow the Way, you will die.
