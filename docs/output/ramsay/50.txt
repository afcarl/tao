In the normal way of things
every three in ten live long,
while every three in ten die young -
and for those just passing through their lives
(that is, every three in ten) the chances are the same.

Why is this?
Well, it all depends on how identified
they are with the mundane world of matter.

People who know how to live
will never do things that threaten their lives,
any more than a traveler who knows
will run into a tiger or a wild buffalo.

Living well is like wearing
a kind of armour that nothing can penetrate.

Living badly is like being attacked!

A practiced sage is invulnerable to attacks
that punch like a buffalo's horn,
that claw like a leaping tiger -
or that stab like a knife in the back.

And why is this?

Because he is impeccable.
