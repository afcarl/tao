The five colours blind the eye -

The five notes deafen the ear...

The five tastes deaden the mouth:

Riding the chase on horseback over the fields
drives you crazy when you overdo it;

And wanting what's precious
you do what distorts your being.

The sage knows this in his gut,
And is guided by his instinct

and not by what his eyes want.
