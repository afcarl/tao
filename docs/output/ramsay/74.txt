If the people are not afraid,
It is useless to try and scare them with death.

And if people are afraid of death
And you make a point of hanging every criminal,
Then who would dare to do anything?

Any killing must be done by an official executioner.

If someone else were to do it,
It would be like trying to copy a master carpenter -

And if you try to cut like him

you will only bloody your own hands!
