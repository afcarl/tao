The Tao
is the source of 'the ten thousand things',

It is the sage's priceless pearl,

And it redeems
everything.

You know, people like to use nice words to impress you.
People act nicely to gain your respect -
but even if a person is bad,
neither the sage nor the Tao will desert him. They accept him.

And when the Emperor is crowned and the three ministers appointed,
it's better to stay where you are and be with the Tao
than to hurry off with gifts of jade and a team of four horses.

The old ones 'knew this gesture',
and by ruling this way they were never
guilty of transgressions or errors.

Nothing under Heaven matters more
than this kind of knowing.
