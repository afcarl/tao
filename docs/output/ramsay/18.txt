When the Great Tao is lost sight of -
Then people have to try to be kind and gentle.

They try to compensate by being clever
But this only breeds hypocrisy and sleight-of-hand.

When families fall out
relationships sour into useless formality.

When the nation is misled and in chaos
ministers mouth empty promises.
