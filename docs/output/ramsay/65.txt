In ancient times, the shrewdest rulers
Didn't try to give people too much know-how.

What did they do? They kept them living simply.
So why are people so difficult to govern now?
Because they know too much in their so-called freedom.

If a leader works deviously,
He will turn the people against him - look and see.
But if you refuse to use that kind of knowing,
Your people will be blessed and happy.

This is where two streams divide:

And if you rule this way
You will be walking the great path of Te.

Deep Te - this Virtue is everywhere

drawing us all
into our final destiny:

Oneness Of The Source And The Sea . . .
