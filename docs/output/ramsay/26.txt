What holds, what you can trust
Is the same as this quietness -
And it is light-hearted.

This quiet light-hearted silence
Is the key to being free from emotion.

The sage never abandons the Tao,
HE never lets its weight out of his sight.

He may live in a fabulous house
But he never gets caught up wanting to -

And though there are always temptations,
He stays unswayed, and smiles.

So why is it that our rulers
Seem so bright, but are
Glib and insubstantial?

Losing the weight of the Tao
Means you lose your root;

And when you can't sit still
You lose
the source.
