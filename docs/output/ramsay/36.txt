What is going to be diminished
Must first be allowed to inflate.

Whatever you want to weaken
Must first be convinced of its strength.

What you want to overcome
You must first of all submit to . . .

What you want to take over
You must first of all give to -

This is called discerning.

You see, what is yielding and weak
Overcomes what is hard and strong:

(And just as a fish can't be seen
when he stays down in the deep

don't show your power to anyone).
