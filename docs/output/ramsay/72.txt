When the people lack a sense of awe,
There is bound to be disorder or disaster.

Never oppress them in their own homes,
or interfere with their means of livelihood.

If you don't oppose them,
They won't try to depose you.

So, the sage who really knows himself
never shows himself off to his people -
loves himself, without false pride -

discards the mask, and wears his true face.
