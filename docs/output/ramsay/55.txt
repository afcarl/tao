'Those who have true te
Are like a newborn baby.'

- and if they seem like this, they will not be stung
by wasps or snakes, or pounced on
by animals in the wild or birds of prey.

A baby is weak and supple, but his hand can grasp your finger.
He has no desire as yet, and yet he can be erect -
he can cry day and night without even getting hoarse
such is the depth of his harmony.

It's stupid to rush around.
When you fight against yourself, it shows in your face.
But if you draw your sap
from your heart
then you will be truly strong.

You will be great.
