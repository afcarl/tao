The sage rules from the purest motives
Relying wholly on quiet and inner peace.

He watches the seasons rise and fall

And if he knows how things grow, he know

They are fed by their roots

And return to their roots;
To grow and flower and flow.

Every thing must have its roots,
and the tendrils work quietly underground.
This quite feeding is the Way of Nature.

If you understand ch'ang - this principle of nurturing,
you can understand everything.
Not understanding it will lead you to disaster.

If a sage knows this, he can rule
And he will do so with patience and justice.

Any man can become wise in this
And he can walk the Way of Heaven

And if you walk that way
you will be royal in the mastery

Life can end in pain
But if you live like this,
under the Tao

You will fill your days with breath.
