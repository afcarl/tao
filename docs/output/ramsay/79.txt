If you've had a real set-to with someone
And you've tried to patch it up -
And there's still some bitterness, what can you do?

I tell you: repay bitterness with good.

Those who practice Te hold credit
- but don't demand repayment.

Those who practice Virtue do their bit
- and those without it will expect you to .

The Tao of Heaven
doesn't deal in nepotism -
it just graces good people, like it always has and will.
