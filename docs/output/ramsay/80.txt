If a nation could be small, with few enough people
Even if you had the means to produce more, they'd be useless.
Such a people would know that death is real,
And they wouldn't travel far, even if they were able to.
They would not vaunt their army or their weaponry.
They would count in their heads again and write by hand.
Their food would be simple, but it would feed them;
Their clothes would be fine, but homely
And they would have fires in their homes.

They would be happy with what they have!
And even though they'd live along the border within earshot
Of their neighbor's cocks at dawn, and the dogs barking,
They wouldn't mind if they never went there.

It is enough, for them, to live and let live.
