No one likes the honest truth,
And all fine talk falls short of it.

Real words are never used to seduce you,
And those that do are no good.

The one who really knows, knows without books
- the so-called learned know nothing.

The sage holds nothing of himself back -
He uses all he has for you, and that is his reward.
He gives all he is
and that is why he's rich.

And the Tao of Heaven
feeds everything, and harms nothing

And the sage's Tao
completes it,
without doing anything.
