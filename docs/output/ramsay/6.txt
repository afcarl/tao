The Tao is the breath that never dies.

It is a Mother to All Creation.

It is the root and ground of every soul

- the fountain of Heaven and Earth, laid open.

Endless source, endless river
River of no shape, river of no water
Drifting invisibly from place to place

... it never ends and it never fails.
