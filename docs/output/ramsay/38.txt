The highest kind of man
Has innate goodness,
And that is what he rules with.

The lesser man brags about how good he is -
And isn't much good, I can tell you.

A man of Te rules by wu-wei
Doing nothing for himself or of himself.

The lesser man acts from his ego
And what he wants is gratification.

A man who rules with compassion
Acts through it - and no one even realizes.

A legal man acts judiciously
But he is still serving his own ends.

And the rigid man uses laws
And if people don't like it, force.

If the true Tao is lost
then morality takes its place.

If that fails, we have 'conscience'.
When that fades, we get 'justice'.

When that disappears, we have the status quo.

Confusion reigns. No one knows
what's going on. Forecasts
and prophecies abound -
and they are merely a gloss on the Tao,
they are the root of all
twisted guidance.

So the sage only looks at what is really real.
He doesn't just look at the surface -
He blows away the dust and drinks the water . . .
He doesn't just go for the flower
But also for the roots and the fruit.

Blow away the dust, now:
Come to the living water.
