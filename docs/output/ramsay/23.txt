It is a natural thing
to talk sparingly.

And surely, this is right - because even a great wind
and lashing rain do not go on forever.

It is naturally so. Both Heaven and Earth know it.

And if neither can hold on to such an outpouring for long
what makes people think they can?

If you follow the Tao,
all you do will belong to it.

If you act with Virtue,
All you do will have its power.

If you lose these -
Then everyway you will be lost.

If you go the Way of Tao, it can only be with you.
If you go the Way of Virtue, its purity will sustain you.

But if you go the way of loss, then that will be your name;
And if you cannot trust, no one will trust you.
