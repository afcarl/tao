The very softest thing of all
can ride like a galloping horse
through the hardest of things.

Like water, like water penetrating rock.
And so the invisible enters in.

That is why I know it is wise
to act by doing nothing.
And how few, how very few understand this!

People teach in the world
what I know to be true:

if you live violently
that is how you will die.
