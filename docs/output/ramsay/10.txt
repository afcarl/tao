Can you nurture your souls by holding them
in unity with the One?

Can you focus your ch'i - your energy
and become as supple, as yielding as a baby?

Can you clear your mind of all its dross
without throwing out the Tao with it?

Can you do it without self-interest
so you shine like a diamond?

Can you love the people of your nation
without being pulled into action?

Can you turn yourself around and let Her rise up over you?

The world spans out in four directions -
and can you be as embracing?

Birthing, nurturing and sustaining:
the Tao does this unceasingly...

It gives without holding on to what it's made,

It gives everything essence, without reward

It knows, without flaunting it

It is serene, beyond desiring

- and this is its Virtue and its Source.
