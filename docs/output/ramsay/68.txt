A canny soldier never provokes anyone,
And is never made to lose his temper.

A good fighter never confronts his enemy head-on:
And those who know how to handle people do it humbly.

This comes from the virtue of not-striving,
and from knowing how to link with other people's energy.

Since time gone in the mists

this has been the way to 'pair up' with Heaven.
