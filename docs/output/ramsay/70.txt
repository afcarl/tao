My words are really very easy to understand
And be with, and walk in . . . but no one can!

My words have roots, my actions have precedents
But people don't see this, and so they don't see me.

So few of you know or understand me
And so the Tao becomes ever more important . . .

The sage goes round like a supertramp,
Hiding the jade, the jewel he carries in his inmost heart.
