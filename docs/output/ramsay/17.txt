The highest form of government
Is what people hardly even realize is there.

Next is that of the sage
Who is seen, and loved, and respected.

Next down is the dictatorship
That thrives on oppression and terror -

And the last is that of those who lie
And end up despised and rejected.

The sage says little -

and does not tie the people down;

And the people stay happy
Believing that what happens
happens, naturally.
