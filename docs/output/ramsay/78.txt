Nothing in the world
is softer than water . . .
- but we know it can wear away the hardest of things.

The supple
Overcomes the hard,
And the so-called weak, the strong.

People know this, but no one quite believes it.

The sage always shoulders the blame, and the grief
- that is why he is fit to rule

He takes on his nation like a world
As if it was the world

- and so it is.

And the truth is that the truth
is often a paradox . . .
