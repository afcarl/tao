He who embodies abundant virtue
May be likened to a ruddy infant:
Wasps, venomous insects, scorpions, and snakes
Do not sting him;
Birds of prey and ferocious beasts
Do not seize him.
Bones weak, muscles soft,
Its grip is firm.
Knowing nothing about the copulation
Between female and male,
Its little penis erects,
Which manifests sublime virility;
It howls all day without becoming hoarse,
Which manifests sublime harmony.
Knowing harmony means constancy;
Knowing constancy means clear-sightedness.
Extravagant living means calamity;
The heart dominating the breath means collapse.
Something ages while still in its prime
Is contrary to the Tao.
What is contrary to the Tao perishes early.
