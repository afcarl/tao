When born, man is soft and weak;
When dead, he is stiff, tough, hard and strong.
When born, the ten thousand things,
Grasses and trees are soft and tender;
When dead, they are withered and dry.
Therefore, it is said:
"The hard and strong belong to the category of death;
The soft and weak belong to the category of life."
Hence, if an army is strong, it perishes;
If a tree is strong, it breaks.
Therefore, the strong and big rank low;
The soft and weak rank high.
