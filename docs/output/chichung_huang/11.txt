Thirty spokes share a hub;
In its nothingness
Rests the carriage's usefulness.
One burns clay to make a pot;
In its nonbeing
Rests the clay pot's usefulness.
One cuts out doors and windows;
In its nonbeing
Rests the room's usefulness.
Therefore, being provides the advantage;
Nonbeing provides the usefulness.
