The reason why rivers and oceans
Can become kings of a hundred valley streams
Is that they are good at lying below them;
Hence, they can become
Kings of a hundred valley streams.
Hence, when the sage man
Wished to be above the people,
He always placed himself below them in speech;
When he wished to be in front of the people,
He always stayed behind them in person.
Therefore, when he was above,
People did not consider him a burden;
When he was in front,
People did not consider him an obstacle.
All under heaven delighted in supporting him unwearily.
Is it not because he did not contend
That none under heaven could with him contend?
