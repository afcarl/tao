When all under heaven know beauty as beauty,
There is ugliness;
When all know goodness,
There is evil.
That being and nonbeing mutually generate,
Difficult and easy mutually complement,
Long and short mutually formulate,
High and low mutually fulfill,
Music and voice mutually harmonize,
Front and back mutually follow
Is constant.
Hence, the sage man
Assumed the office of nonaction,
Conducted speechless instruction.
When the ten thousand things rose,
He did not initiate.
He assisted without taking credit;
Scored merits without claiming.
Precisely because he claimed not,
They never vanished.
