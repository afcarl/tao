Attain emptiness to the utmost;
Adhere to stillness indefatigably.
The ten thousand things rise everywhere;
I thereby observe their revolution.
While things grow exuberantly,
Each will again revert to its root,
Which means stillness;
Stillness means reverting to life;
Reverting to life is the constant.
Knowing the constant is clear-sighted.
Not knowing the constant is blind;
Acting blindly is disastrous.
Knowing the constant leads to all-embracingness;
All-embracingness leads to impartiality;
Impartiality leads to kingliness;
Kingliness leads to heaven;
Heaven leads to the Tao;
The Tao leads to permanence;
A lifetime without peril.
