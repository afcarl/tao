There was something
That into an indistinguishable mass had wrought itself,
Born before heaven and earth.
Desolate and formless,
It stood alone, unchanging,
And may be regarded as
The mother of heaven and earth.
Not knowing its name,
I gave it the alias "Tao,"
And reluctantly named it "vast."
Vast and moving;
Moving and far-reaching;
Far-reaching and reverting.
The Tao is vast;
Heaven is vast;
Earth is vast;
The king is also vast.
In the empire, there are four vasts,
And the king constitutes one.
Man imitates earth;
Earth imitates heaven;
Heaven imitates the Tao;
The Tao imitates the way things are.
