Brave in daring, one gets killed;
Brave in not daring, one lives.
Of these two -
One is beneficial, one harmful.
That which heaven loathes -
Who knows its reason?
Heaven's Tao,
Without battling, excels in triumphing;
Without speaking, excels in responding;
Without being summoned, comes spontaneously;
Though loose, excels in planning.
Heaven's net is vast:
Though wide-meshed, misses nothing.
