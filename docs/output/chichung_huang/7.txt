Heaven is permanent and earth, everlasting.
The reason why heaven and earth
Can be permanent and everlasting
Is that they do not live for themselves.
Therefore, they can live permanently.
Hence, the sage man
Withdrew himself to the back,
Yet found himself in front;
Cast himself aside,
Yet found himself preserved.
Is it not because he was selfless
That he could fulfill the self?
