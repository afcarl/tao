Long, long ago, those that acquired One were:
Heaven, which acquired One
And thereby became clear;
Earth, which acquired One
And thereby became tranquil;
Spirits, which acquired One
And thereby became miraculous;
Valley streams, which acquired One
And thereby became full;
Marquises and kings, who acquired One
And thereby became chieftains over all under heaven.
Going to the extreme would mean:
If heaven were excessively clear,
It would crack;
If earth were excessively tranquil,
It would quake;
If spirits were excessively miraculous,
They would cease to be so;
If valley streams were excessively full,
They would go dry;
If marquises and kings were endlessly noble and high,
They would collapse.
Therefore, the noble must take the humble to be their roots;
The high must take the low to be their basis.
Hence, marquises and kings call themselves "The inadequate one," "the deficient one" and "the unworthy one."
This means taking the humble to be their roots,
Does it not?
Therefore, the highest praise is no praise.
Hence, do not wish to be as noble as jade,
Nor as high as a mountain rock.
