A good traveler leaves neither ruts nor footprints;
A good speaker makes neither slips nor errors;
A good calculator uses neither wooden chips nor bamboo chips;
A good door-shutter has neither latch nor lock,
Yet, the door he shuts cannot be opened;
A good knot-tier has neither rope nor string,
Yet, the knot he ties cannot be untied.
Hence, the sage man
Was constantly good at rescuing men
So that there were no cast-off men;
As for things,
There were no cast-off goods.
This is called surpassing insight.
Hence, good men are good men's teachers;
Evil men, good men's wealth.
He who neither values his teachers,
Nor cherishes his wealth,
Though crafty, is but a big fool.
This is called subtle essence.
