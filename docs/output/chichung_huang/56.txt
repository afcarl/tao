He who knows does not speak;
He who speaks does not know.
Stop your hole,
Close your door,
Soften your brightness,
Mingle with the dust,
File your sharpness,
And unravel your entanglements.
This is called deep and remote concord.
Therefore, neither can anyone become intimate with you,
Nor can anyone become alienated from you;
Neither can anyone benefit you,
Nor can anyone harm you;
Neither can anyone exalt you,
Nor can anyone debase you.
Therefore, you are exalted by all under heaven.
