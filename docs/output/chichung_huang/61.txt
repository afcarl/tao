A large state is the lower stream,
The female to all under heaven,
The converging point of all under heaven.
The female constantly uses stillness
To overcome the male.
As she is still,
It is proper that she stay low.
Therefore, if a large state
Stays low to a small state,
It wins the small state;
If a small state
Stays low to a large state,
It is won by the large state.
Therefore, one stays low to win;
One stays low to be won.
Therefore, the large state
Merely wishes to annex and feed the other;
The small state
Merely wishes to join and serve the other.
If each is to have its wish,
The large state should stay lower.
