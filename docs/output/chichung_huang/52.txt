All under heaven have a beginning,
Which is considered the mother of all under heaven.
Having found their mother,
You thereby know her children.
Having known her children,
You revert and adhere to their mother,
A lifetime without peril.
Stop your hole,
Close your door,
A lifetime without end.
Open your hole,
Increase your disturbances,
A lifetime without remedy.
Seeing tiny things is clear-sightedness.
Adhering to softness is strength.
Use its light,
Withdraw your own clear-sightedness,
And you shall bring yourself no calamity.
This is called following the constant.
