The sage man never had a predisposed heart,
Taking the hundred family's heart
To be the concern of his heart.
Good people - he was good to them;
Evil people - he was also good to them.
Goodness was attained.
Honest people - he was honest to them;
Dishonest people - he was also honest to them.
Honesty was attained.
When the sage man presided over the empire,
Unbiased, he muddled their hearts
For all under heaven.
The hundred family names
All lent him their ears and eyes;
The sage man turned them all into infants.
