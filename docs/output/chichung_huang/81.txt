Truthful words are not beautiful;
Beautiful words are not truthful.
He who knows is not widely informed;
He who is widely informed does not know.
He who is good does not have much;
He who has much is not good.
The sage man did not accumulate,
Exhausting himself to help the people,
He was fuller;
Exhausting himself to give the people,
He was richer.
Therefore, heaven's Tao
Benefits without harming;
Man's Tao
Assists without contending.
