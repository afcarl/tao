The manifestations of grand virtue
Follow only the Tao.
The Tao is something
Faint and dim:
Dim and faint,
Therein lies an image;
Faint and dim,
Therein lies substance.
Deep and remote,
Therein lies quintessence.
Its quintessence is most genuine,
Therein lies truthfulness.
From the present to antiquity,
Its name has never vanished,
Whereby I trace back to
The father of the multitude.
How do I know
What the father of the multitude was like?
From this.
