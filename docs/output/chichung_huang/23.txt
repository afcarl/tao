Speechlessness conforms to the way things are.
A turbulent wind does not last a whole morning;
A torrential rain does not last a whole day.
Who does these?
Heaven and earth.
Even heaven and earth cannot last long,
How can man?
Therefore, he who pursues the Tao
Identifies with the Tao;
He who pursues virtue identifies with virtue;
He who pursues loss identifies with loss.
He who identifies with virtue -
The Tao, too, shall requite him with favor;
He who identifies with loss -
The Tao, too, shall requite him with loss.
