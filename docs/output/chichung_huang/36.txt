That which shall contract
Must have long expanded;
That which shall weaken
Must have long strengthened;
That which shall depart
Must have long partaken;
That which shall take
Must have long given.
This is called subtle insight.
Softness and weakness overcome strength:
Fish cannot leap out of deep water;
So cannot the state's sharp weapons
Be displayed to men.
