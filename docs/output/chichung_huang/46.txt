When the empire possessed the Tao,
Galloping horses were turned back to manure the fields;
When the empire has lost the Tao,
War-horses are bred on the frontier.
No crime is greater than indulging in greed;
No misfortune is greater than not knowing content;
No catastrophe is more grievous than thirsting for gain.
Therefore, the content of knowing content
Makes one constantly content.
