Looking at it, you do not see it -
This is called "invisible";
Listening to it, you do not hear it -
This is called "inaudible";
Trying to touch it, you do not feel it -
This is called "intangible."
These three, which defy thorough inquiry,
Long ago merged into One.
One is something
Whose past is not remote,
Whose future, not transient.
Continuous and unending,
It is unnameable,
And again reverts to nothingness.
This may be called the formless form,
The immaterial image.
This is called faint and dim:
Following it, you do not see its tail;
Meeting it, you do not see its head.
Hold on to the present Tao
To govern the present realm,
Whereby you know its primeval origin.
This is called the Tao's thread-head.
