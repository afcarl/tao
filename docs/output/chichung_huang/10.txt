In making your soul embrace One,
Can you keep it from departing?
In concentrating your breath to make it utterly soft,
Can you do so as an infant does?
In cleaning and dusting the deep and remote mirror,
Can you make it spotless?
In loving the people and governing the state,
Can you practice nonaction?
In opening and closing the heavenly gate,
Can you play the feminine?
In keeping clear-sighted and all-perceptive,
Can you refrain from using craft?
Generate them;
Rear them.
Generate without possessing;
Lead without dominating -
This is called deep and remote virtue.
