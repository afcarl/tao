If the majority of people do not fear death,
Why use killing to intimidate them?
If the majority of people do fear death,
Those who act perversely -
I can arrest and kill them.
Who would dare then?
The Executioner is always the one in charge of killing;
To kill in place of the Executioner
Is to chop wood in place of a master carpenter.
To chop wood in place of a master carpenter,
One can hardly avoid injuring one's own hand.
