He who wishes to win all under heaven,
And act upon them -
In my view, he cannot prevail.
All under heaven are sacred vessels
That cannot be acted upon.
He who acts upon them ruins them;
He who holds on to them loses them.
For people -
Some walk; some follow;
Some blow warm; some blow cold;
Some are strong; some weak;
Some safe; some in danger.
Hence, the sage man
Abandoned excessiveness;
Abandoned arrogance;
Abandoned extravagance.
