When the superior scholar hears the Tao,
He does his utmost to practice it;
When the middling scholar hears the Tao,
It seems existent, seems non-existent;
When the inferior scholar hears the Tao,
He bursts out laughing.
If he did not burst out laughing,
It would not deserve to be the Tao.
Hence, "Established Sayings" has it:
"The clear Tao seems obscure;
The advancing Tao seems receding;
The even Tao seems rugged;
Supreme virtue is like a valley;
Great white seems black;
Abundant virtue seems deficient;
Robust virtue seems flabby;
Honest truth seems capricious;
The great square has no corners;
The great vessel is imperfect;
The great voice has no sound;
The celestial image has no form."
The Tao is invisible and nameless;
The Tao alone
Begins well and ends well.
