Use the Tao to assist your sovereign lord;
Do not use military power
To flaunt your strength over all under heaven.
Such things are apt to boomerang:
Where an army has encamped,
Brambles and thorns grow.
A good commander stops
Once his end is achieved,
And does not thereby seek military superiority.
His end achieved, he is not arrogant;
His end achieved, he is not conceited;
His end achieved, he does not brag;
His end achieved, he accepts it reluctantly.
This is called
Achieving the end without seeking military superiority.
Something ages while still in its prime
Is contrary to the Tao;
What is contrary to the Tao perishes early.
