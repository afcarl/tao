Heaviness is the root of lightness;
Stillness is the sovereign of restlessness.
Hence, the gentleman journeyed all day
Without leaving his luggage vans.
Though having imperial guards,
In leisure, he was as clear as day.
How could a ten-thousand-chariot king
Conduct himself lightly over all under heaven?
Light, he would lose his root;
Restless, he would lose his sovereignty.
