Were I but firmly enlightened,
Walking along the great Tao,
My only fear would be going astray.
The great Tao is exceedingly even,
But the sovereign is exceedingly fond of gullies.
While the court is exceedingly well-kept,
The fields are exceedingly weedy,
And the granaries exceedingly empty.
Clad in elegant and colorful attire,
Wearing a sharp sword,
And sated with food,
He has enough wealth and to spare.
Such a man is called the chieftain of bandits;
Being the chieftain of bandits goes against the Tao.
