He who boasts cannot stand;
He who looks at himself is not illustrious;
He who parades himself is not clear-sighted;
He who brags about himself has no merit;
He who is conceited does not last long.
These, according to the Tao, are
Leftover food and improper deeds
Which people all loathe.
Therefore, he who possesses the Tao
Does not accumulate.
