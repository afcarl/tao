The Tao is where
The ten thousand things flow;
The good man's treasure,
That by which the evil man is preserved.
Good words can win one honor;
Good deeds can command esteem from others.
The evil among men -
Why should they be abandoned?
Therefore, in enthroning the Son of Heaven,
Or installing the Three Counselors,
Though one has a jade-disk
That fills one's arms,
Preceding a team of four horses,
It is better to prostrate oneself
And present this.
Why did the ancients treasure this Tao so?
Is it not said:
"What one seeks will thereby be obtained;
What one is guilty of will thereby be pardoned?"
Therefore it was treasured by all under heaven.
