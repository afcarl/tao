Between "Yes, sir" and "Of course, not!" -
How much difference is there?
Between good and evil -
What difference it is!
He whom the people fear
Cannot but fear the people also.
Faintly, it seems boundless!
The multitude is jubilant,
As if feasting on the Grand Pen,
Or, in springtime, ascending a tower;
I am disinterested, showing no sign whatever,
Like an infant who cannot smile yet;
Fatigued, as if having nowhere to return.
The multitude all has enough and to spare;
I, alone, am destitute.
Mine is a fool's mind indeed, how stupid!
The vulgar are clear-sighted;
I alone am benighted.
The vulgar are discerning;
I alone am muddle-headed.
Dimly, like an ocean!
Faintly, as if endless!
The multitude is all enterprising;
I alone am slow and clumsy.
I wish to be uniquely different from others,
And cherish my nursing mother.
