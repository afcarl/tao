The people are starving,
Because he takes too much grain tax,
Hence, they are starving.
The hundred family names are unruly,
Because their sovereign has the intention to act,
Hence, they are unruly.
The people take death lightly,
Because he seeks after extravagant living,
Hence, they take death lightly.
Only one who does not apply himself to living
Is worthier than those who exalt living.
