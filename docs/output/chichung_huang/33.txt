He who knows others is crafty;
He who knows himself is clear-sighted.
He who overcomes others has strength;
He who overcomes himself has stamina.
He who knows content is rich;
He who practices strenuously achieves his aspiration;
He who does not lose his base is long-enduring;
He who dies without forgetting is long-lived.
