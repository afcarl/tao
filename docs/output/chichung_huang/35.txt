Take hold of the great image,
And all under heaven will flock to you.
Once there, unharmed,
They will settle down in peace and prosperity.
Music and pastries
Make the wayfarers pause.
Therefore, when the Tao utters words,
They say: "How bland and tasteless!
Looked at,
It is not worth seeing;
Listened to,
Not worth hearing."
When used, however,
It is inexhaustible.
