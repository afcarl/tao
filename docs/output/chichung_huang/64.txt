When stable,
It is easy to maintain;
When no symptoms have emerged,
Easy to deal with;
When tender,
Easy to break;
When tiny,
Easy to disperse.
Tackle it before it takes shape;
Bring order before it becomes chaotic.
A tree the circumference of an embrace
Grows out of a downy tip;
A nine-storied tower
Rises from a basketful of earth;
A hundred-ren ascent
Begins from under one's foot.
He who acts upon them ruins them;
He who holds on to them loses them.
Hence, the sage man acted not
So that he ruined not;
He did not hold on to them
So that he did not lose them.
When people engage in a task,
They often ruin it at its completion.
Therefore, it is said:
"Be discreet in the end as in the beginning,
And you will not ruin your task."
Hence, the sage man
Desired to be desireless,
And treasured not goods hard to come by;
He learned to be unlearned,
And was exempted from the errors
Other rulers had committed;
He was able to assist the ten thousand things
To be the way they were
Without daring to act.
