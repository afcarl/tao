"People cherish humiliations like surprises;
They treasure great calamities like their lives."
What is meant by
"People cherish humiliations like surprises"?
Humiliations are degrading,
Yet they receive one like a surprise;
Lose one like a surprise.
This is what is meant by
"People cherish humiliations like surprises."
What is meant by
"They treasure great calamities like their lives"?
The reason why I have great calamities
Is because I have my life;
If I did not have my life,
What calamities would I have?
Therefore, if you treasure governing your life
More than governing the empire,
You deserve to be entrusted with the empire;
If you grudge using your life
To govern the empire,
You deserve to be charged with the empire.
