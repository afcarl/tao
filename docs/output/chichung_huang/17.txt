The supreme sovereign - the people barely knew he was there;
The next - they loved and praised him;
The next - they feared him;
The lowest - they despised him.
Only when his trust became deficient
Was there distrust.
Hesitant, he grudged his words;
Merits scored, affairs accomplished,
The hundred family names said: "That's the way things are with us."
