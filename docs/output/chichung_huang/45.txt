Great perfection seems imperfect -
Its function is unfailing;
Great fullness seems empty -
Its function is inexhaustible.
Great straightness seems bent;
Great eloquence seems tongue-tied;
Great adroitness seems clumsy;
Great affluence seems deficient.
Restlessness overcomes cold;
Stillness overcomes heat.
Emptiness and stillness
May serve as the norm of the empire.
