People emerge into life and enter into death.
The category of life constitutes three tenths;
The category of death constitutes three tenths;
And those who, seeking extravagant living,
All move to the realm of death
Also constitute three tenths.
Why so?
Because they seek extravagant living.
I hear that those who excel in preserving life,
Walking in mountains,
Shun neither rhinoceros nor tiger;
Entering a battle,
Incur wounds from neither weapon nor armor.
The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn;
The tiger has nowhere to press its claws;
Weapons have nowhere to lodge their blades.
Why so?
Because they do not belong to the realm of death.
