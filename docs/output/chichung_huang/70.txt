My words are exceedingly easy to understand,
Exceedingly easy to practice.
Yet none under heaven can understand them,
None can practice them.
Words have their progenitor;
Affairs have their sovereign.
It is because of ignorance
That they do not me understand.
Those who understand being rare,
I become all the more valuable.
Hence, the sage man wore a coarse tunic,
But carried in his bosom a piece of jade.
