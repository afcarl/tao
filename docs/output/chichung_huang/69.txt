A strategist once said:
"I dare not play the host,
Rather, I'd play the guest;
I dare not advance one inch,
Rather, I'd retreat one foot.
Which means:
Marching without ranks,
Baring no arms,
Holding no weapons,
I will still emerge invincible.
No calamity is greater than being invincible;
Being invincible almost cost me my treasures."
Therefore, when two confronting armies are equally matched,
The compassionate party wins.
