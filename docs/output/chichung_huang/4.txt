The Tao is the empty space of a vessel,
Yet, when used,
Never brims over.
How deep,
Like the ten thousand things' progenitor!
It files its sharpness,
Unravels its entanglements,
Softens its brightness,
And mingles with the dust.
How transparent,
As if existing!
I do not know whose son it was;
Seemed to precede the Emperor.
