In governing the people and serving heaven,
There is nothing like sparingness.
Sparingness alone
Can lead you to early submission.
Early submission means accumulating virtue repeatedly.
If you accumulate virtue repeatedly,
There is nothing you cannot overcome.
If there is nothing you cannot overcome,
Nobody knows its limit.
If nobody knows its limit,
You are fit to possess a state.
If you possess the mother of governing a state,
You may long endure.
This is called the way
To deepen the roots and strengthen the base,
To lengthen life and perpetuate vision.
