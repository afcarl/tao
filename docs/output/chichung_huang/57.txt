Use the norm to govern the state;
Use the abnormal to conduct warfare;
Use nondisturbance to win all under heaven.
How do I know it should be so?
For the more prohibitions and taboos in the empire,
The poorer the people;
The more sharp weapons the sovereign has,
The more chaotic state and fief;
The craftier the sovereign,
The more perverse things will arise;
The more ostentatious royal processions,
The more robbers and thieves there will be.
Hence, the sage man's saying goes:
"If I implement nonaction,
The people will live and grow spontaneously;
If I love stillness,
The people will turn aright spontaneously;
If I create no disturbances,
The people will become rich spontaneously;
If I desire to be desireless,
The people will turn into unhewn logs spontaneously."
