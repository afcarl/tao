A small state with few people:
Let there be utensils ten,
A hundred times its population
Without being used;
Let the people take death seriously,
And stay away from migration;
Let there be boats and carriages
With no occasion to ride them;
Let there be armor and weapons
With no occasion to display them;
Let the sovereign revert to tying knots
With a rope and put it to use.
Make their food delicious,
Their clothes beautiful,
Their customs joyous,
Their habitations comfortable.
Neighboring states may be within sight of each other,
And sounds of roosters and dogs within hearing,
Yet the people, to their old age and death,
Never come and go visiting one another.
