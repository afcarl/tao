Weapons are inauspicious instruments
Which people all loathe.
Therefore, he who possesses the Tao
Does not accumulate.
The gentleman ordinarily honors the left;
At war, he honors the right.
Therefore, weapons are not the gentleman's instruments.
Weapons being inauspicious instruments,
If you cannot but use them,
It is best to cover up their sharp blades;
Do not relish them.
If you relish them,
It means you enjoy killing men.
He who enjoys killing men
Cannot be allowed to prevail in the empire.
Hence, on auspicious occasions,
Precedence is given to the left;
In mourning,
Precedence is given to the right.
Hence, a lieutenant general stands left;
A senior general stands right,
Meaning it is handled with mourning rituals.
If the number of men killed is multitudinous,
Preside over it in grief.
After winning a war,
Handle it with mourning rituals.
