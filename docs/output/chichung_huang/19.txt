Eliminate sageness, abandon craft,
And the people shall benefit a hundredfold;
Eliminate humanity, abandon righteousness,
And the people shall revert to filial piety and parental love;
Eliminate adroitness, abandon profit,
And robbers and thieves there shall be none.
These three remarks are considered rhetorically inadequate,
Therefore, let us put them where they belong:
"Display the undyed silk and embrace the unhewn log;
Diminish selfishness and reduce lusts;
Eliminate learning and dispense with anxiety."
