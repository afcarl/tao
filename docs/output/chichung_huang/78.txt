Nothing under heaven is softer and weaker than water,
Yet, in attacking the hard and strong,
Nothing can surpass it,
Because nothing can replace it.
That the soft overcome the hard,
And the weak overcome the strong -
None under heaven does not know it,
Yet none can practice it.
Hence, the sage man's saying goes:
"He who bears the state's humiliations
Is called lord of the land;
He who bears the state's calamities
Is called king of the empire."
A positive statement sounds paradoxical.
