All under heaven say I am vast;
Vast, but resemble nothing.
It is precisely because I resemble nothing
That I can be vast.
If I had resembled anything,
Long ago I would have become tiny indeed.
I constantly have three treasures
Which I uphold and value:
First, compassion;
Second, frugality;
Third, not daring to precede all under heaven.
Being compassionate,
I can be courageous;
Being frugal,
I can be all-embracing;
Not daring to precede all under heaven,
I can serve as
Head of the great vessels.
Now, if I had abandoned compassion and chosen courage,
Abandoned frugality and chosen all-embracingness;
Abandoned the back and chosen the front,
It would have been the death of me.
For compassion, used in battle,
Will bring you victory;
Used in defence,
Will make you impregnable.
When heaven is about to establish someone,
It seems to wall him up with compassion.
