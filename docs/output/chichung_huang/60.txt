Governing a large state
Is like frying small fish.
Use the Tao to preside over the empire,
And its spirits will not be mischievous;
Not that its spirits will not be mischievous,
But that their mischief will not harm the people;
Not that their mischief will not harm the people,
But that a sage man never does any harm.
Since neither harms anyone,
Their favors will converge.
