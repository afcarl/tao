How the Tao overflows!
It may be found left and right.
The ten thousand things relying on it for their living,
It does not decline;
Having scored successes,
It claims no possession;
Clothing and feeding the ten thousand things,
It does not assume masterdom;
Meaning it is constantly lustless,
And may be named among the tiny.
When the ten thousand things return,
They do not know who their master is;
Hence, it may be named among the vast.
That is why the sage man
Was able to achieve vastness.
As he never assumed vastness,
He was able to achieve vastness.
