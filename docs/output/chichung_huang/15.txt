In antiquity, he who excelled in implementing the Tao
Was minutely discerning and subtly perceptive,
Profound beyond recognition.
As he was beyond recognition,
I reluctantly depict him thus:
"Undecided, as if in winter, wading through water;
Hesitant, as if fearing the four neighbors;
Awe-inspiring, like a guest;
Melting, like ice thawing;
Simple, like the unhewn log;
Turbid, like muddy water;
Expansive, like a valley.
In muddy water, he stilled it
And gradually made it limpid;
In comfort, he stirred it
And gradually made it vital."
Those who treasure this Tao
Do not wish to be full,
Hence, they can remain ragged and imperfect.
