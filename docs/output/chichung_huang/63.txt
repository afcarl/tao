Act without action;
Disturb without disturbance;
Taste the tasteless.
Great, small, much, little,
Requite enmity with favor.
Tackle a difficult issue while it is easy;
Create a great enterprise while it is small.
All difficult issues under heaven
Begin from easy ones;
All great enterprises under heaven
Begin from small ones.
Hence, the sage man never presumed vastness,
So, he could achieve vastness.
For he who makes promises lightly
Must lack in trustworthiness;
He who takes many things easy
Must encounter many difficulties.
Hence, even the sage man
Considered the task difficult,
Therefore, eventually he had no difficulty.
