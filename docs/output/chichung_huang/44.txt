Fame and life - which is dearer?
Life and wealth - which is weightier?
Gain and loss - which is drearier?
Excessive love entails enormous costs;
Abundant stores entail heavy losses.
Therefore, knowing content
Will exempt you from humiliation;
Knowing where to stop
Will exempt you from peril.
You may long endure.
