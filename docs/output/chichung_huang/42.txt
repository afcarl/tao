The Tao generated one;
One generated two;
Two generated three;
Three generated the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things,
Carrying yin and embracing yang,
Used the empty vapor to achieve harmony.
What people loathe most are
Inadequacy, deficiency and unworthiness,
Yet, kings and dukes use them
To refer to themselves.
People sometimes gain through losing;
Sometimes lose through gaining.
Therefore, what kings teach,
I also choose to teach kings:
"A brute does not die a natural death."
I shall use it as the father of learning.
