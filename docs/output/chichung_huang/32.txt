The Tao is constant and nameless.
The unhewn log, though tiny,
None under heaven dare subjugate.
If marquises and kings can adhere to it,
The ten thousand things will submit to them spontaneously.
When heaven and earth integrate
To drip sweet dew,
Without anyone ordering them,
It is evenly distributed spontaneously.
With the first cutting,
Names emerged.
Names having emerged,
One should also know where to stop.
Knowing where to stop
Will thereby exempt one from peril.
The Tao's relation to all under heaven
Is like small valley streams
To a river or an ocean.
