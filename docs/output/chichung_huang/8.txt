The supreme good man is like water.
Water is good at benefiting
The ten thousand things without contending,
Lying where the multitude loathes to:
Therefore, close to the Tao.
In habitation,
He is good at choosing the place;
In mind,
Good at profundity;
In giving,
Good at imitating heaven;
In speech,
Good at honesty;
In government,
Good at bringing order;
In duties,
Good at exerting his ability;
In making moves,
Good at timeliness.
Being uncontentious,
There is no resentment.
