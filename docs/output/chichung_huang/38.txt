The man of supreme virtue
Claimed no virtue,
Hence, he possessed virtue;
The man of the lowest virtue
Would not lose virtue,
Hence, he possessed no virtue.
The man of supreme virtue did not act,
And had no intention to act;
The man of supreme humanity acted,
But had no intention to act;
The man of supreme righteousness acted,
And had the intention to act;
The man of supreme rituals acted,
And as none responded to him,
He rolled up his sleeves to drag them along.
Hence, only when the Tao was lost
Did virtue emerge;
Only when virtue was lost
Did humanity emerge;
Only when humanity was lost
Did righteousness emerge;
Only when righteousness was lost
Did the rituals emerge.
Now, the rituals represent
The thinness of wholehearted sincerity and truthfulness
And the beginning of chaos;
Foresight represents
The flower of the Tao
And the beginning of folly.
Hence, the great man abided by its thickness,
And not its thinness;
He abided by its substance,
And not its flower.
Therefore, he abandoned that and chose this.
