Heaven's Tao
Is like the fixing of a bowstring:
Too high, lower it;
Too low, lift it.
More than enough, reduce it;
Not enough, replenish it.
Therefore, heaven's Tao
Takes from those who have more than enough
To replenish those who do not have enough;
Man's way
Takes from those who do not have enough
To offer to those who have more than enough.
Who can, having more than enough,
Offer some to heaven?
Perhaps only those who possess the Tao.
Hence, the sage man
Helped without possessing,
Scored merits without claiming.
That is how
He did not wish to parade his worth.
