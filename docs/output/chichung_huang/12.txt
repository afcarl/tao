The five colors make people's eyes blind;
Galloping and hunting make people's heart go wild;
Goods hard to come by make people's acts injurious.
The five flavors make people's mouth numb;
The five notes make people's ears deaf.
Hence, when the sage man ruled,
He supported the stomach, but not the eye.
Therefore, he abandoned that and chose this.
