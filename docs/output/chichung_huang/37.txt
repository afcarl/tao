The Tao is constant and nameless.
If marquises and kings can adhere to it,
The ten thousand things will live and grow spontaneously.
While they live and grow spontaneously,
If lusts arise,
I shall fill them with the nameless unhewn log.
Being filled with the nameless unhewn log,
They shall become lustless.
Lustlessness leads to stillness;
Heaven and earth shall turn aright spontaneously.
