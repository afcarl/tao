Therefore, a good commander is not militant;
A good strategist is not irritable;
A good vanquisher of enemies is not confrontational;
A good employer of men stays low to them.
This is called the virtue of noncontention;
This is called the ability of employing men;
This is called a match for heaven,
A paragon among the ancients.
