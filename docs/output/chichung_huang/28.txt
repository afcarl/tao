Knowing his masculinity,
Adhering to his femininity,
He remained to all under heaven a brook.
Being to all under heaven a brook,
His constant virtue never departed.
His constant virtue never departed,
He again reverted to infancy.
Knowing his whiteness
Adhering to his blackness,
He remained to all under heaven a valley.
Being to all under heaven a valley,
His constant virtue was sufficient.
His constant virtue being sufficient,
He again reverted to the unhewn log.
[Knowing his whiteness,
Adhering to his blackness,
He remained to all under heaven a horizontal bar
Being to all under heaven a horizontal bar,
His constant virtue never changed.
His constant virtue never changed,
He again reverted to Infinity.]
When the unhewn log dispersed,
It became vessels;
When the sage man was employed,
He became chief of the officialdom.
A great tailor does no cutting.
