If your government is muddled,
Your people will be simple;
If your government is exacting,
Your people will be daring.
Against misfortune leans good fortune;
In good fortune lurks misfortune.
Who knows its extremity?
There is no norm.
Normal reverts to abnormal;
Good reverts to evil.
The perplexity of rulers
Has been long indeed!
Hence, be square without cutting,
Angular without pricking;
Straight without binding;
Bright without dazzling.
