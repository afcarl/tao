Heaven and earth are unfeeling,
Treating the ten thousand things like straw and dogs;
The sage man was unfeeling,
Treating the hundred family names like straw and dogs.
The space between heaven and earth -
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible.
The more it operates, the more it emits.
Much learning brings a quick end.
Better adhere to the middle.
