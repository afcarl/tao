Do not exalt talents
So that the people will not contend;
Do not treasure goods hard to come by
So that the people will not steal;
Do not parade enviable things
So that the people will not rebel.
Hence, when the sage man ruled,
He emptied their minds,
Filled their stomachs,
Weakened their ambitions,
Strengthened their bones.
He constantly made the people
Uncrafty and unlustful,
And made them know not to be daring.
He acted not, that is all.
Thus, the state cannot but become well-ruled.
