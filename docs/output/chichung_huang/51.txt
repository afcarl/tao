The Tao generates them,
Virtue nurtures them,
Matter forms them,
And instruments complete them.
Hence, the ten thousand things
Honor the Tao and treasure virtue.
That the Tao is honored
And virtue is treasured is not because
Anyone has conferred titles upon them;
It is constantly the way things are.
The Tao generates them,
Nurtures them,
Grows them,
Raises them,
Shapes them,
Solidifies them,
Stores them,
Covers them.
It generates without possessing,
Assists without taking credit,
Leads without dominating.
This is called deep and remote virtue.
