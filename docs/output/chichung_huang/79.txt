In pacifying a great enmity,
There must be some remnant enmity.
How could that be considered good?
Hence, the sage man
Held the left half of the deed
Without demanding payment from the people.
Therefore, those who possess virtue administer deeds;
Those who possess no virtue administer tithing.
Heaven's Tao is unbiased;
It always supports good men.
