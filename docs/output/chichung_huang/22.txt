"Incomplete shall be complete;
Bent shall be straight;
Hollow shall be full;
Worn shall be new;
Little shall gain;
Much shall delude."
Hence, the sage man
Took hold of One to serve
As shepherd over all under heaven:
He did not look at himself,
Therefore, illustrious;
He did not parade himself,
Therefore, clear-sighted;
He did not brag about himself,
Therefore, meritorious;
He was not conceited,
Therefore, long-enduring.
It is precisely because he did not contend
That none could with him contend.
The ancient saying:
"Incomplete shall be complete" -
Is it mere words?
Truly, it shall end up complete.
