If the people do not fear terror,
Greater terror shall arrive.
Do not squeeze their habitation;
Do not obstruct their livelihood.
Only when you stop oppressing them
Will they stop loathing you.
Hence, the sage man
Knew himself without parading himself,
Loved himself without exalting himself.
Therefore, he abandoned that and chose this.
