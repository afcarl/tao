The human being is born fragile and sensible,
When dying it is inflexible and stiff.
The offshoots are flexible and fragile,
When plant is old, they become stiff and die.

What is strong and stiff is the sign of death,
What is weak, fragile and sensible is the sign of life.

A stiff tree is hard to bend,
When blown by a strong wind is broken.
What is not flexible will die,
What is heavy and stiff falls to the ground,
What is light is carried far away by the wind.
