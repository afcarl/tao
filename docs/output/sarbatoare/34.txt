Tao contains the whole Universe.
All things come out of Tao.
It doesn't reject anybody or anything.

He who is on the Tao Way is a creator,
But doesn't take possession of the creation.
He is generous, but doesn't look for gratitude of people.
Without own desires, he isn't easily noticed.
He does good things without taking merits.
Not displaying his greatness, the Wise Person is great indeed.
