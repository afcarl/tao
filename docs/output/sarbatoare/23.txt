By speaking less I am at rest.
The wind, the tempest don't last too long,
Like everything in nature the man don't last long too.

The one following the Tao Way becomes identical with Tao,
The one following the Virtue becomes identical with Virtue (Te).
Those lost are one with the lost things,
Those unable to believe, they cannot be believed either.
