Compassion is the best defense.
A good fighter is not afraid and not aggressive,
An efficient conqueror is not involved in heavy fighting,
A true leader does not display his authority in an aggressive way.

The courageous and not-threatening one attracts people,
A good conqueror does not base his gain through violence,
A good leader does not acquire his status through aggressive authority,
Because the path of harmony generate harmony in everything.
