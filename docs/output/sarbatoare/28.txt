He who knows own strengths remains weak,
Being on the Tao Way, he feels like a child.
He who is a scholar behaves like being simple,
He is a good example, always a model on the Tao Way.
He who attains the glory and is humble in his virtue,
Stays with the source from where everything arises.

The Wise Person is thus always in harmony,
Being in the light, always at rest is one with the infinity.
