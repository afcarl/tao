When leaders do not install too many law restrictions,
People are happy,
Otherwise people are unhappy.

From greater abundance, poverty follows,
From greater poverty, abundance will arise.
Thus the middle way is the best.

The Wise Person follows the middle way,
He is himself a live example.
He does not push his will, thus people follow him,
Correct in actions, good results are achieved.
He follows discipline, but tolerant with others,
People will notice his contentment.
