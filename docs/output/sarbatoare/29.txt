The one who wants to master the world
To shape it the way he wants, will not succeed.
The world is sacred, it cannot be permanently changed.

Being confident of something, we might be wrong.
On traveling some people are in front, some behind,
Some breathe easy, some heavy,
Some are strong, some weak,
Some walk, same sit in a carriage.

The Wise Person prefers the middle way.
Being in harmony, neither he goes to the extreme nor is he lazy
In doing actions with his body and mind.
