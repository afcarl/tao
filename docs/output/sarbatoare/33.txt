Knowing the way people are, is wisdom,
But knowing himself, is indeed enlightenment.
Conquering an enemy is power,
Conquering himself is read power.
Contempt with what he has, the Wise Person is rich.
A persevering person will attain the goal.
The one who keeps steady has a good direction.
Even after death,
The power of the Wise Person has positive effects.
Thus he lives eternal.
