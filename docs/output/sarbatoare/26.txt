That is light is above the heavy,
A calm mind is above an agitated one,
The Wise Person is freed from what is heavy and agitated,
In the middle of activities in the world he is at rest.

A Leader doesn't act on impulse or without deep consideration,
The lack of deep thought hasn't a solid base,
Acting on impulse leads to loose control.
