In a small community having few people,
To accumulate useless things does not make sense.
To live a simple life is more important.

To know the world, travel is not necessary,
The light of mind could be used instead.
For defense, the display of weapons is not necessary,
They should be kept hidden until needed.

The good relationships with neighbours are vital,
For peace and tranquility to reign.
The Wise People attains thus freedom.
