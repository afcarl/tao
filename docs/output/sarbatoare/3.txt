A read leader is always humble.
He doesn't show strength,
Thus, around him there is no confrontation.
He doesn't show precious things,
Thus, people won't steal.
He doesn't show things people would wish to have,
Thus, corruption won't arise.
The Wise one leads people,
Keeping their hearts pure and giving them food.
They do not know ambition,
The wise one keeps them healthy
And, far from bad actions.
He wishes good to all,
Thus, the bad people could not act.
His leadership is subtle, all people live in peace.
