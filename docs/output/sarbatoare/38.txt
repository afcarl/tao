The Wise Person doesn't display his virtue that is why he is virtuous.
The ordinary person displays his virtue that is why he is weak.
High virtue doesn't manifest open,
Things are thus finalized properly.
The weak virtue always manifests,
Things are thus not completed.

The goodness of the Wise Person doesn't have any reason,
Gradually people will follow him.
Being on the Tao Way, the Virtue (Te) follows.

When the virtue disappears, goodness will appear.
When goodness disappears, compassion is expressed.
When compassion is lost, the rules are installed.
Thus the sincerity and trust disappear,
Confusion and distortion of events become wide spread.

The Wise Person sees not only the surface but the depth too.
He can see the potential fruit in a flower.
Thus using his virtue he sees the reality
That is behind the transitory manifestation.
