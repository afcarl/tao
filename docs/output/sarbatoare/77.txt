The Tao Way is like a stretched bow,
The extremities will lower when the middle rises.
What is in excess diminishes, what is little rises.
The Tao Way takes from where there is excess,
And does add wherever there is shortage.

But the ordinary human way it is such that it,
Takes from where is shortage,
And gives to whoever has already abundance.
How then the mankind could be happy?

But the Wise Person knows that he does not own anything truly,
Whatever surplus he has is given to the people, without expectations.
Working without pride, he is a living proof.
