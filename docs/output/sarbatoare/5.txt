Nature is not biased by anything,
Sees everything with equal potential.
Similarly, the Wise one doesn't have preferences,
For him, everyone is seen equally.

The universe in infinite,
In it there is everything.
By moving, creates,
Moving more, more things appear.

Too much talking results in tiredness,
The best to keep is the middle way.
