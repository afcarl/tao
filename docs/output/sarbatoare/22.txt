What is low can rise.
What is twisted could be straightened.
What is empty attracts the full.
The end will generate a beginning.
He who has little will have a lot
He who has a lot will loose.

The Wise Person is on the Tao Way,
Like an example to follow.
He has no pride thus he shines,
He doesn't put himself in front thus pay attention,
He doesn't praise himself thus he has merit.
He doesn't want to lead thus he is appreciated.
He isn't in competition with anyone.
Thus no one wants his place.

From the old time is said to be humble,
Thus integrity will be maintained.
The humble one is on the Tao Way.
