There are few in the world following the Wise One
Who lives and acts with simplicity.
The ordinary person hardly understands the way of the Wise,
Although the facts are evident and logic in their manifestations.
By giving respect and honour to the Wise One,
We become part of his wisdom.

Although the Wise One might not have expensive apparel,
He might seem not much important,
But his treasure rests in his heart.
