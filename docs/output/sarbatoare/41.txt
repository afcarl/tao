Hearing about the Tao Way, the Wise Person will follow,
The mediocre sometimes follows sometimes not.
Hearing about the Tao Way, the ignorant foolishly amuses.

Wouldn't be the Tao Way, if an ignorant doesn't behave foolishly.
That is why it is said:
"The ignorant doesn't appreciate an enlightened person,
A good advice is seen worthless,
A good path to follow is ignored."

The Wise Person looks empty like a valley,
The pure Virtue looks to be without core,
It's difficult to see the end of the extended full.
That which is simple looks without consistence.

There is a way of perfection.
The universe doesn't stop in a point.
Knowledge needs time to accumulate.
Music is learned going towards the subtle realm.

The Tao Way cannot be contained, in its manifestation
Brings fulfillment to the person on the perfection path.
