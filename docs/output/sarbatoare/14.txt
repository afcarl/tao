Looking at the Tao Way, it cannot be seen.
Trying to hear it, it cannot be heard.
Wishing to feel it, it cannot be touched.
These three characteristics cannot be defined,
The Tao Way cannot be perceived,
It has the consistency of the void.

It is the shape without shape,
It cannot be known by senses.

The Infinity the Eternal cannot be explained,
Meeting the Tao Way, it doesn't have a beginning,
Following the Tao Way, it doesn't have an end.

By knowing how the Tao Way worked in the past
The present can be known.
Living the present as an effect of the past
Is to follow the Tao Way.
