A big country attracts everybody.
There many people will meet.
It is like the feminine spirit that attracts by submission.
One who submits leads in a subtle way.

In a similar way, a big country which
Does not show its pride and power
Will conquer the small countries without struggle.
If a small country submits becomes bigger
Thus the big country acquires more people
And the small country more space.
The gain is therefore mutual.
