The Virtue (Te) follows the Way (Tao).
The Tao Way cannot be seen or touched,
Although unseen, untouched the Tao Way has forms.
Unseen, untouched it has consistency,
Subtle and hidden it has an essence.
Its essence is eternal, was always in existence,
As source of all things.
How can we know the way creation is done?
By knowing the Tao Way.
