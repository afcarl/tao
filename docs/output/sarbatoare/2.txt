The beautiful is known as beautiful,
Because we know what ugly is.
The good is known as good,
Because we know what bad is.

Every aspect has its counterpart.
What is heavy resides on what is light.
Long and short opposes each other.
Toll and short support each other.
A voice is made up of sounds.
What begins has to have an end eventually.

The wise one will lives by non-interfering,
Thus he instructs other by example not by words.

Things in the world continuously change.
The wise one doesn't cling on anything.
For him all are seen with the same potentiality.
He acquires merits but is not attached to them.
His takes things the way they are.
In performing he is above the actions.
Thus his merits are always with him.
