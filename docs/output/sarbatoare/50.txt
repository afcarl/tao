Coming into the world is getting out of the Tao Way.
The death time is the time of going back into Tao, into the rest.
The Wise Person knowing that doesn't disturb the harmony.
He waits to understand what is shown to him.
When light is shown, it is sure he is on the Tao Way,
All dangers are thus avoided.
Although he lives in the world, he is on the Tao Way, always at rest.
His death is no more but a continuation.
