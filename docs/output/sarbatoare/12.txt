The explosion of colors will blind the man,
The explosion of sounds will make his deaf,
The strong taste will weaken his taste feeling,
Being too much in the forest to catch animals,
Will make the man wild.
Things hard to get will make his mind stiff.
Thus, the Wise Person doesn't use too much his senses.
He lives more in his inner world.
