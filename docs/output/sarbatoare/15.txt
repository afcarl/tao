In the past, those followers of the Tao Way,
Were very deep in spirit, not easy to be understood.
Such a Wise Person was so cautious
Like a man crossing a river in the wintertime.
He was so slow in taking decisions
Like one afraid of being misunderstood.
He was so humble, like one who doesn't deserve anything.
He didn't interfere with anyone's movement
Like a piece of ice on a slippery surface.
He was so simple and natural
Like a piece of wood from a forest.
He was ready to receive like a wide valley.
Friendly like mixing waters.

That who found himself in dirty waters,
Should let them to become clean.
That who is unsettled, unable to stay still
Should slow down all the actions.
Those on the Tao Way avoid taking action,
Thus their potential always remains high.
