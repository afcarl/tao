The Tao Way creates all things, the Virtue (Te) maintains them.
Harmony is maintained by following the Tao Way,
Values are given to things when the Virtue (Te) is acquired.

By following the Virtue (Te) things grow and develop,
Things are taken care of, protected, what lives is fed.

Although everything is contained within Tao,
It looks like is completely empty.
The Wise Person is equally the same,
His virtue is in everything he does.
By not assuming any possession he is thus on the Tao Way.
