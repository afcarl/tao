When the Tao Way is lost,
The multitude of laws and rules will appear.
When the Ego is strong in people
The hypocritical behavior is strong too.
When the family bonds are loosen,
The family issues are in the attention of everyone.
When a nation is in confusion,
The country will have a lot of patriots.

Being on the Tao Way, things are in equilibrium,
Without Tao, a multitude of differences will appear.
