Good deeds are not done in a hurry,
Efficient work does not need great effort.

By small steps, what is little will grow,
And what is behind will eventually come in front.

Great expeditions start with a small step,
Great achievements have little beginnings,
The Wise Person is able to envisage future results,
In small steps, and humble beginnings.

Thus the Wise One following the Tao Way,
Starting with moderation, anything is achieved.
His works are thus solid and time lasting,
Because all it is done patiently and without struggle.
