Going on the path of the world, things are multiplying.
Going on the Tao Way, things are diminishing.
By having less and less things, the source of emptiness can be reached.

By movement, things are out of their natural way,
Thus, work is necessary to put them in balance.
On the Tao Way things are already in equilibrium,
Thus action isn't necessary.
