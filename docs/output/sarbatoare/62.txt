The Tao way is the way of light.
For good people it is a treasure, the weak run away.

Good words will gain people's hearts,
By good deeds respect is obtained.
But the Tao Way is above all,
The one who can see it is truly bathes in light.

To choose a leader, not richness or human experience is necessary,
But his proficiency of the Tao Way is essential.

Why the ancient did appreciate those of the Tao Way?
Because they were loved by people!
