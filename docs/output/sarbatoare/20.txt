By removing the cause of suffering, suffering will disappear.
Both 'Yes' or 'No' are relative.
Be it considered as 'Good' or 'Bad',
The relativity of it still remains.
If other people are afraid of something,
Is this a good cause for us to be afraid as well?
The truth behind could be entirely different.

People of the world will continue to marry,
Organize festivals and parties.
It's only me without wishes like a baby unable to be happy.
Living without certainty I have no possessions.

People of the world want to accumulate things,
Nothing I have, some might call me fool.
Other people have acquired knowledge,
I look too simple to attract any interest.
People see great variety of things, I see everything as one.
I look like having no goal like a sea wave moving,
Blown by wind, I seam to go nowhere.
People have aims in their actions that I don't have in mine.
Looking no ordinary, I am on the Tao Way.
