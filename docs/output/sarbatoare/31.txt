Weapons bring misfortune.
Somebody on the Tao Way will detest them.
He doesn't use them but forced to defend.
Even so, he is restrained.

A Wise Leader when winning is not happy about his victory.
He is not happy about killing people.
In battle he is sad of doing it,
Because a victory is not a time to celebrate, but for funerals.
He who is happy in killing and crimes,
Is not on the Tao Way.
