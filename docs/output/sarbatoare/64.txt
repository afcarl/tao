Troubles can be avoided even before arising.
When harmony is maintained beforehand,
Confusion is not able to surface.

By closing the door, the entry is not possible,
A big tree was in its beginning a tiny offshoot,
Thus a great expedition starts with a little step.

The Wise Person is not looking to gain anything,
He does not want glory or reputation.
Thus he cannot loose anything.
This is his living proof of achievements without efforts.
