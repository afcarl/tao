When people follow the Tao Way,
Community's horses are in the field at work.
When people do not follow the Tao Way,
Community's horses are ready for war,
Thus, there is no work in the field.

There is no grater error, but wishes out of vanity.
There is no grater suffering, but lack of contempt.
There is no grater calamity, but greed.
Because for the one who doesn't have many wishes, nothing is missing,
He is contempt with what he has.
Not looking to obtain anything from anyone,
The field is thus cultivated.
