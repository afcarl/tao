Before the existence of Heaven and Earth,
It was something without beginning and end.
Unchanged existed in itself.
That something filled in everything without end.
It can be considered as the source of the Universe.
I cannot name it, but forced to give a name,
I name it Tao, I see it as supreme.

Supreme means without end,
Having no end it can be everywhere,
It is both far and near,
That Supreme is Tao.
Heaven, Earth and man are supreme too,
A man follows the laws of the Earth,
The Earth those of the Heaven,
The Heaven follows Tao,
That is complete in itself.
