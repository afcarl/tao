Between glory and health, what is more important?
Between wealth and happiness what is more precious?
Running after gain is a big loss,
If happiness will be obtained with wealth
Many people would be happy, but they are not.

The one happy with whatever he has, will avoid humiliation
He who knows to stop at the right time, will avoid danger,
Thus the Wise Person will last.
