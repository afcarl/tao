The water of a river follows always down the valley,
The river is thus the master of the valley.

To gain people's hearts, is necessary to serve them,
To lead people, they must be followed.

Thus being above people, the Wise Person
Does not look like an oppressor.
When the Wise Person stands in front of people,
They do not feel as being confronted.

Thus the Wise Person is a living proof of his wisdom,
People around him have the feeling of being protected.
