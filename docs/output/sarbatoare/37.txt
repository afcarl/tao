The Tao Way looks inactive, but everything is accomplished.
If Leaders will follow, the world will be harmonized by itself.
For solutions to multitude of problems, simplicity has to be followed.
Simplicity will diminish the number of wishes.
Having little wishes this brings tranquillity.
Without many wishes, the world harmonizes itself.
