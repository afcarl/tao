Those people following Tao have three main qualities,
Compassion that generates courage,
Caution that generates power,
And modesty that generates influence.

But people's ordinary actions
Are to glorify a false hero.
To obtain power through force and lack of caution,
To acquire influence by the display of pride.

But only the one who is compassionate is a true hero,
Only the cautious one is able to obtain real power,
Only the humble one can truly influence people,
Because he in on the Tao path.
