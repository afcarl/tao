Nothing is so flexible like the water although appears to be weak,
But in time could penetrate the hardest rock.

What seems to be light, in time conquers the heavy,
What seems to be weak, in time conquers the strong,
Although these facts look like being known by everyone,
Few people are ready to apply them in life.

The one who is modest is the best leader,
The one who could solve people's problems is the read leader.
