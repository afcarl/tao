The knowledge has to come from the inside.
The human mind can take various forms.
Thus, without going out the world can be known,
Without looking out of the window, the sky can be known.
The more we look at the external forms, the less we know them.
The Wise Person will reach the destination
Even without starting the trip.
He can see the light without using his eyes.
He knows without doing any research.
He can do everything by being always at rest.
