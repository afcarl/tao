The Wise One does not act without the inner urge.
He does not interfere with other people affairs,
He takes to arms only in defense.

Although he knows his value very well,
The Wise One does not exalt his personality.
He gives great respect o himself,
But does not expect the same from others.
He lets the course of actions of life to flow,
When they do not touch him in any way.
He intervenes only when actions,
Have significance for his life.
