He who follows the Tao Way is like a child.
He looks weak, but his pressure if firm.
He looks without power, but his movement is energetic.
He looks like has nothing to say,
But his words come always at the right time.

The Wise One is always in harmony,
Thus he is always in tone with the universe,
Being in tone with the universe he shines always.
