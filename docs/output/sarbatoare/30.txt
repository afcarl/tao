A Leader following the Tao Way
Doesn't use force to conquer.
Because he knows of the riposte,
That brings destruction, hunger and disease.

The Enlightened Person doesn't use force for glory.
He does his actions without interfering.
He uses fight only in defense.
Thus he doesn't disturb harmony.
He who uses force is not on the Tao Way,
Thus he will be destroyed.
