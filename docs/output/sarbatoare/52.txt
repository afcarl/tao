Tao is the cause of everything.
By knowing the cause, the effects could be known.
Even from the middle of manifestations, the cause could be seen.

Thus the Wise Person lives in harmony,
He doesn't take any front position thus he is protected
Thus all problems are avoided.
The Wise Person can see the cause of things.
Being able to see the cause he can know the manifestations.
Being soft it is his strength, expanding he is always in harmony.
This is the way he lives in eternity.
