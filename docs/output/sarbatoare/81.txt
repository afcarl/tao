The Wise Person is full of honesty his words have substance.
In empty talk the honesty is missing.
Enlightenment does not come because somebody is educated,
Happiness does not come from riches.

The Wise Person does not live for himself,
In doing good actions for others he is satisfied.
The more he gives the more he receives,
Around him there is harmony everywhere,
Being on the Tao Way he is well established in Virtue (Te).
