Without wishes tranquillity is obtained.
Everything in existence,
One day is absorbed in non-existence.
What has a vigorous grows,
Eventually returns to the source.
The union with the origin is tranquillity,
That is the natural condition of things and the eternity.

He who knows this is enlightened.
He who doesn't know will suffer.
Knowing what eternity is, he is united with everything.
United with everything, he will expend.
Expending, he is everywhere.
Being everywhere a high state of awareness is obtained.
Through high awareness he is on the Tao Way.
On the Tao Way eternity is reached.
Although the body can decay and die,
His spirit is eternal.
