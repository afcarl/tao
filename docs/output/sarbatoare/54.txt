The Wise Person will carefully plant his plant-seeds,
He strongly builds his house,
Thus his careful and well-done actions
Will be examples for many generations to come.

By practicing the Tao Way for himself,
The Wise Person practices the Virtue (Te).
Followed by a family, the Virtue brings prosperity,
Followed by a community, that community will flourish.
Followed by an entire country,
That country becomes a good example for other countries,
Followed by the whole world, the Virtue has universal value.

If a man followed Virtue, he is an example for his family,
When a family follows Virtue, it is an example for the community,
If a community follows Virtue, it is an example for the country,
If a country follows Virtue is an example for the whole world.
This can be proved by observation.
