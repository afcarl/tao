The one who speaks doesn't know,
The one who doesn't speak knows.
By closing the eyes, not hearing, not smelling,
Not touching, nor tasting, the senses are closed.
But a world of harmony it is opened in the mind.

The Wise Person is not concerned by friends,
enemies, glory or disgrace.
He reaches perfection by following the Tao Way.
