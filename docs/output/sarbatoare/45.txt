The way of perfection has no end no matter how high it is,
Still something can be added.
Its use is thus better and better.

Infinity no matter how big is, still something can be added.
Thus its usefulness is greater and greater.

No matter how straight a thing can be, still can be straightened.
The art of doing anything, can still be improved.
The one who has a good speech, he can do better.
What is moving can be improved.
Only that is not moving is complete in itself.
That is the base, the model and leads everything.
