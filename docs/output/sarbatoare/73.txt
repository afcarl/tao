A courageous man who does not control himself,
Either kills or is killed.
But a courageous man, himself in control, lives,
The heaven protects the one who does not harm anyone.
The Tao Way is similar,
Being neither opposing nor struggling to go forwards.
Although does not speak out, it gets an answer.
Although does not ask for anything, obtains everything.
Although does not want to achieve anything, all is achieved.

In its immensity, Tao seems to be empty,
But it is like a sieve that follows the laws of matter.
