Going on the Tao Way and abandoning the human teaching,
The multitude of problems due to the temporal morality will disappear.
By giving up the justice done by laws and rules,
The natural justice will emerge.
Renouncing to profit and expensive things,
Society will get rid of thieves and robbers.
By giving up these three things,
Simplicity, naturalness and abundance will be obtained.
