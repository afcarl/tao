The Tao Way is too subtle to be defined.
In manifestation only has a name.

When a Leader is on the Tao Way
Is honestly followed by people,
Thus peace will be in the kingdom.

The Wise Person following Tao knows own limits
He who knows own limits is on the Tao Way.
Tao does everything, all creatures return in Tao,
The Wise Person knowing this applies Tao in everything he does.
