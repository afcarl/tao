Although there are 30 spokes around wheels' hub,
Its usefulness is given by the emptiness in the middle.
The clay vessel is useful
Because of the empty space given by its form.
A house made of walls, windows and doors,
Is useful through the space created.
Although we give value to things that exist,
We use in fact something that does not exist.
