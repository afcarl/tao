The Wise Leader knows this.
Something will contract, because it was expended.
Something becomes weak, because it was strong.
Something goes high, because it was low.
Somebody receives, because he gave before.
This is real wisdom, when the subtle is thus applied.

As a fish shouldn't leave the water,
So the Wise Leader doesn't glorify force.
Simplicity brings peace as trust brings harmony.
