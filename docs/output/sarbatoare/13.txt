Both success and failure generate fear.
Good though or bad thought bring that duality
Which is present all the time in the strained mind.

How success or failure creates fear?
The lucky one waits his win with impatience,
The one who failed is unsettled because of his loss.

How a good thought or a bad thought,
Is present in the strained mind?
It is because we have an Ego.
If we don't pay much attention to own Ego,
The strained mind is much relaxed.

Thus, he who sees others, like he sees himself
Is worthy to be a leader.
He who love others like himself
Is worthy of trust.
