A good traveler doesn't leave any trace,
A good speaker is not lost in idle talk,
A good estimator isn't lost in calculations,
A door having a good locker doesn't need for another one,
Something tightened up by a good rope, doesn't need for another rope.

The Wise Person helps everybody by his presence,
Everything around him is in the right place,
Being in the Light nothing is lost.

A good person teaches a bad one by good examples,
A bad one teaches a good one by bad examples.
Those who don't appreciate a Wise Person and his teaching,
Live in illusion, heading towards a bitter end of actions,
Although they might be well educated.
The Wise Person's actions are very subtle.
