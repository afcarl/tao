Those who know of the Way do not speak of it,
Those who speak of the Way do not know it.
Close your mouth, shut the doors of your desires,
blunt your sharpness, untie the tangles of your life,
dim your glare, quiet life's turmoil,
this is the Mystic Virtue.
Those achieving Mystic Virtue are not affronted or thrilled either by hate or love;
they are removed from benefit and harm; beyond care of praise or blame,
they are the true humans, unequaled under Heaven.
