The master has no subjective conceptions,
His heart is open to the people.
He is kind to the kind.
He is also kind to the unkind.
This is the true practice of kindness.
To the honest he is trusting,
To the dishonest he is also trusting,
This is the true practice of trust.
The sage appears hesitant, and lives in harmonious peace in the world,
He considers his own mind as well as that of the people.
The people look to him lending their eyes and ears, and he treats them all as his children.
