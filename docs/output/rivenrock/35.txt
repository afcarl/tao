The wise seek solace in the Tao,
Wherever they go they find comfort and succor that may be extended to others who seek.
A feast with roasting foods and spirited music may detain a traveler.
But words speaking of the Tao seem bland and dull.
Looked for nothing will be seen,
Listened for, nothing will be heard.
But when you use it, it will never diminish.
