When the way of the Tao is forgotten,
morality and ethics need to be stressed.
When the body's innate intelligence is not heeded,
deception becomes routine, and men learn to pretend to be wise and good.
When genuine peace among people is not regarded;
filial piety and compassion are made apparent.
When a nation falls into chaos; loyalty and patriotism are renewed.
