When conflicts and disputes are reconciled, there is certain to be some lingering ill-will and resentments.
How can this be rectified?
Consider this: The wise man will keep his part of the bargain, and not insist on fulfillment by the other party.
Thus it is that the good fulfill their end of obligations, while the ungood work hard to avoid payment.
While even though the way of Heaven is impartial, it smiles with favor on the good.
