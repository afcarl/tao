Fill a cup to its brim and it is easily spilled.
Keep sharpening your knife,
and it will quickly dull.
When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them safe.
If you care about people's approval:
you will be their prisoner.
After finishing the work, depart.
This is the Way of Heaven.
