The form of great virtue is something that only the Tao can follow.
The Tao as a "thing" is vague and obscure.
How obscure! How vague! Yet in it there is form.
How vague! How obscure! But in it there are things.
How deep! How dark! In it there is an essence.
The essence is so real--therein is belief.
Since before time and space were,
the Tao IS.
It is beyond is and is not.
How do I know this is true?
I look inside myself and see.
