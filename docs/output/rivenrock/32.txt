The Tao is forever nameless, formless and shapeless.
Being so, it is like the uncarved wooden block; its value is not easily perceived.
No King can make the wooden block His subject;
yet if the King and the people were to embody the Tao,
the Earth would be like a paradise, all would live in harmony, and the equilibrium would flow without surcease.
But man cannot let the block sit; they divide it and number each piece, carving it and naming the functions.
Know when to stop the carving and naming, this will prevent you from carving into perilous territory.
Do not force the carving; let the functions of the Tao flow of their own accord as the rivers of the Earth flow to the sea.
