The heavy is the root of the light.
Composure is the ruler of instability.
An experienced traveler will journey all day, watching over his belongings;
Though there may be spectacles to see
He easily passes them by.
However splendid the views,
he stays serenely in himself.
Why should the lord of the country
flit about like a fool?
If he is unstable, he will lose his rulership.
Rather than glitter like jade
He must stand like common stone.
