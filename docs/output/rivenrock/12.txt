Too many colors blind the eye,
Too much music deafens the ear,
Too many flavors dull the palate,
Racing and hunting madden the mind,
Too much desire withers the heart.
In this manner the sage cares for people:
He provides for the inner being,
not the insatiable longing of the mind.
He fulfills his needs,
not worldly temptations.
