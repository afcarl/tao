In the beginning was the Tao; this beginning can be considered as the mother of all.
Knowing the mother, one can come to know the children.
Knowing the children, but returning to the mother; this will keep your spirit alive through death and decay.
Keep your mouth shut, close the doors of desire, and you will live a virtuous and untroubled existence.
But if you let your mouth go on, and let the desires of the world into your heart,
your life will be one of unending toil and vexations.
To see the small, obscure and detailed is clarity of vision.
To live in gentleness and flexibility is strength.
Use outlook and insight, and return to clear-sightedness Then you will avoid life's troubles.
This is called cultivating consistency.
