The sage follows the natural way.
Like an experienced tracker...he himself leaves no tracks.
Like a good speaker...his language lacks flaws and rebuke.
Like an experienced counter he needs no calculator.
He is like a well-made door, which needs no lock.
He is the perfect knot, leaving no end to be unraveled.
He attends to every detail.
It is in this way that the sage is skilful at saving men,
and so he does not cast away any man.
He is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything.
This is called embodying the light.
It is in this way that the skillful master is the teacher of the one without skill.
And the one without skill is the charge and responsibility of the master.
From the teachings of the master, all might learn who wish to listen.
Not respecting the teacher, nor valuing the student, you will see confusion, no matter how intelligent you are.
This is called the Essential Subtlety.
