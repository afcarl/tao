One can open oneself to the world without leaving the house,
Without looking out the window one can know the way of Heaven.
The further one goes and the more knowledge one accumulates, the less one knows.
With this way; the master knows and experiences without traveling,
Observes clearly without seeing,
And accomplishes much without doing anything.
