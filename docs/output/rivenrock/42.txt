The Way creates one,
One gives birth to two,
Two gives rise to three,
And three produce all things.
All things are composed of yin and yang,
The proper blending of these attributes will ensure harmony.
The common man hates to be small, powerless and unworthy;
but this is how the masters describe themselves.
Thus it is that in gaining is oftentimes much lost,
And in the most profound loss can be found the most gain.
What others have taught I teach also, 'a violent man will lead himself to a violent death',
This is the essence and cornerstone of my teachings.
