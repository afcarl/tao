If you glorify the worthy, you will bring forth strife.
Overvaluing possessions induces thievery.
If you desire the expensive, your heart will never loosen.
The master leads by clearing people's minds,
He fills their inner being, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones.
He helps people lose all that they know.
If people lack cleverness and desire, then they will not presume to act, and harmony will reign.
By not striving, he maintains his inner harmony,
And remains at peace within himself.
