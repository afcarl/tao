Rule a big country
As you would cook a small fish.
When beneath-heaven is ruled with Tao,
Demons don't go spiriting.
Not only do the demons not spirit,
But spirits don't harm people.
Not only do the spirits do no harm,
But the sage also does no harm.
Since both do no harm,
Virtue is restored intact.
