Good walkers leave no tracks:
Good speakers make no points;
Good reckoners use no counters.
Good lockers turn no keys,
Yet no one opens their locks.
Good binders tie no ropes,
Yet no one undoes their knots.
What is more,
The sage is always good at saving men:
No one is cast out.
He is also good at saving things:
No thing is cast out.
Call this following the light.
Hence good men teach the not good.
Not-good men are the lessons of the good.
Not to esteem the teacher,
Not to love the lesson,
Is to go astray despite great learning.
Call this the subtle secret.
