Tao is always without a name,
Simple and small.
Beneath-heaven dares no subject it.
If kings and barons can hold to it,
The ten thousand things will pay homage.
Heaven and earth will mutually join
And sweet dew will fall.
Not by law but of themselves
The people will stay in balance.
When law and order arose,
Names appeared.
Aren't there enough already?
Is it not time to stop?
To know when to stop
Is to be free from danger.
Tao is to all beneath heaven
As rivers and seas are to rivulets and streams.
