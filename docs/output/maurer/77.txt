Heaven's Tao is like a stretched bow:
The top goes down and the bottom goes up. What has much is shortened;
What has little is increased.
Heaven's Tao takes from those with much
And gives to those with little.
Man's way is not so:
It takes from those with little
And gives to those with much.
Who uses muchness
To serve beneath heaven?
Only he who has Tao!
Therefore the sage
Does but does not claim,
Completes his work but takes no credit.
He does not want his merit seen.
