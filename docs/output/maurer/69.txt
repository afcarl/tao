The strategists have a saying:
I dare not be a host,
But rather a guest;
Dare not advance an inch,
But rather retreat a foot.
This is called
Marching by not-marching,
Capturing by not-baring arms,
Charging by not attacking,
Seizing by not-bearing arms.
There is no evil heavier
Than to make light of an enemy.
To make light of an enemy
Is to lose what we value.
Thus when armies clash
The one that grieves wins.
