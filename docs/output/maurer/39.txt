From of old, there are those who reached oneness:
Heaven reached oneness and became clear;
Earth reached oneness and became tranquil;
The spirits reached oneness and became mystic;
The valleys reached oneness and became full;
The ten thousand things reached oneness and became potent;
Barons and kings reached oneness and became sovereign.
Did they not all become so through oneness?
If heaven were not clear,
It probably would crack,
If earth were not tranquil,
It probably would quake.
If spirits were not mystic,
They would probably desist.
If the valleys were not full,
They probably would die out.
If the thousand things were not potent,
They probably would die off.
If barons and kings were not sovereign,
They probably would fall.
Indeed,
The great has its roots in the humble;
The high has its foundations upon the low.
Barons and kings call themselves
The orphaned, the lonely, the unworthy:
Do they not have their roots in the humble?
Truly, the parts of a cart are not the cart.
Do not shine like jade
Or sound like stone chimes.
