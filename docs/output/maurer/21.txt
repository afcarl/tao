The nature of great virtue
is to follow Tao alone.
And Tao's style is elusive, evasive.
Evasive, elusive
Yet within it is form.
elusive, evasive,
Yet within it is substance.
Dark and dim,
Yet within it is vitality,
Its vitality is very real:
Within it is trust.
From of old
Its name has not ceased,
For it has watched all beginnings.
How can all beginnings be known?
Inward light!
