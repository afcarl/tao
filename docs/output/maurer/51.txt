Tao gives them life;
Virtue shapes them;
Reality rears them;
Circumstance completes them.
Thus the ten thousand things
All worship Tao and esteem virtue.
No one commands them
To worship Tao and esteem virtue.
They do so of themselves.
For Tao gives them life.
Virtue nurses them, raises them,
Nurtures them, shelters them,
Comforts them, feeds them,
And protects them.
Rear but don't own!
Work but don't claim!
Raise but don't butcher!
This is called inward virtue.
