A man lives soft and weak,
Dies hard and stiff.
The grass, the trees, the then thousand things
Live soft and supple,
Die brittle and dry.
Hence
The hard and stiff
Are followers of death;
The soft and weak
Are followers of life.
For
When armies are stiff, they will lose;
When trees are stiff, they will fall.
The stiff and mighty will be cast down;
The soft and weak will be lifted up.
