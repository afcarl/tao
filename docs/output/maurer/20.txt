Give up learning:
You will no anxieties.
How much difference is there
Between ah and oh?
How much difference is there
Between god and evil?
What men fear
Must I fear?
Utter nonsense!
All men are happy happy,
As if consuming sacrificial feasts,
As if mounting the Spring Terrace.
I alone am mild
Like one who gives no sign,
Like an infant who does not smile,
Forlorn like one with no place to go.
All men have plenty;
I alone am a loser
A fool at heart indeed!
The world's people are bright bright;
I alone am dull dull.
The world's people are smart smart;
I alone am low low,
Bland as the sea,
Aimless as the wind.
All men have their uses;
I alone am stubborn and uncouth.
But I differ most from the others
In prizing food drawn from my Mother.
