What is going to shrink has first been stretched.
What is going to weaken has first been made strong.
What is going to be ruined has first been raised up.
What is going to be taken away has first been given.
Call this the subtle truth:
The soft and weak conquer the hard and strong.
Fish should not leave the depths;
Neither should weapons of state ever be aired.
