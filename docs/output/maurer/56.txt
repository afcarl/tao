He who speaks does not know.
He who knows does not speak.
Block the passages!
Shut the doors,
Blunt edges,
Untie tangles,
Harmonize lights,
Unite all dust.
Call this the original oneness.
It can't be had by courting,
Can't be had by shunning;
Can't be had by helping;
Can't be had by harming;
Can't be had by praising,
Can't be had by blaming:
For it is beneath-heaven's highest.
