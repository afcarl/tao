True words are not nice;
Nice words are not true.
A good man does not argue;
An arguer is not good.
The wise are not learned;
The learned are not wise.
The sage does not hoard.
The more he does for others,
The more he has himself.
The more he gives,
The more he gets.
The way of Heaven is
To benefit but not to harm.
The way of the sage is
To work but not compete.
