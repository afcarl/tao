On tiptoe you don't stand.
Astride you don't walk.
Showing yourself, you don't shine.
Asserting yourself, you don't show.
Boasting yourself won't get you credit.
Vaunting yourself won't let you endure.
In Tao, these things are called
Tumors and dregs, which all things abhor.
Whoever has Tao does not dwell on them.
