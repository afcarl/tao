Fine weapons are tools of ill fortune;
All things seem to hate them.
Whoever has Tao does not depend on them.
At home a gentleman favors the left;
In war he favors the right.
Since weapons are tools of ill fortune,
They are not the tools for a gentleman,
Who uses them only from necessity.
Peace and quiet he upholds;
Victory he does not enjoy.
To enjoy victory is to like slaughter.
Whoever likes it
Cannot thrive beneath heaven.
Things of good omen favor the left;
Things of ill omen favor the right.
The under-general stands to the left;
The top-general stands to the right:
The way to stand at a burial rite.
Killing multitudes brings weeping and sorrow;
Treat victory like a funeral.
