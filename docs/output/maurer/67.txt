All beneath heaven say
My Tao seems like folly.
But it is great
Because it seems like folly.
Were it not like folly,
Long indeed would it have been petty.
I have three treasures,
Held close and guarded.
The first is love.
The second is simplicity.
The third is not-daring to be first beneath heaven.
Whoever is loving can be brave;
Whoever is simple can be generous;
Whoever is not-daring to be first beneath heaven
Can be a vessel of excellence.
But to be brave without being loving,
Generous without being simple,
Foremost without being hindmost,
That is to perish!
For love cannot fight without winning.
Cannot defend without strengthening.
When heaven helps,
It protects by loving.
