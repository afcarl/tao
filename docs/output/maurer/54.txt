What is well planted won't be uprooted;
What is well grasped won't slip away.
Sons and grandsons will keep the sacrifices.
Practice virtue in yourself:
Virtue becomes real.
Practice it in the family;
It becomes abundant.
Practice it in the county,
It becomes increased.
Practice it in the country,
It becomes prolific.
Practice it beneath heaven,
It becomes universal.
Thus persons are to be looked at as a person,
Families as a family,
Counties as a county,
Countries as a country,
Beneath-heaven as beneath-heaven.
How do I know about beneath-heaven?
Inward light!
