Twist and get whole.
Bend and get straight.
Be empty and get filled.
Be worn and get renewed.
Have little: get much.
Have much: get baffled.
Therefore the sage
Holds to the One and
Becomes beneath-heaven's model.
He does not show himself,
Hence he shines.
Does not assert himself,
Hence he is seen.
Does not boast his merits,
Hence he survives.
Does not compete with anyone,
Hence no one beneath heaven
Can compete with him.
The old saying,
The twisted shall be made whole
Is it not true?
Be whole and you will return.
