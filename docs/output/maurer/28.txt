Know the masculine;
Keep to the feminine.
Be beneath-heaven's ravine.
To be beneath-heaven's ravine
Is to stay with unceasing virtue
And return to infancy.
Know the white;
Keep to the black.
Be beneath-heaven's model.
To beneath-heaven's valley
Is to stay with abundant virtue
And return to simplicity.
When simplicity diversifies
It produces instruments
That the sage uses as officers.
Indeed, a great leader does little cutting.
