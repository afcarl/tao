In maintaining the vital spirit,
Can you hold to oneness
And not come apart
In developing the vital senses,
Can you be like an infant child?
In loving the people and ruling the state,
Can you hold to nothing-knowing?
In opening and closing heaven's gate,
Can you act like a mother bird?
While seeing clearly in the four directions,
Can you hold to nothing-doing?
Rear the people,
Feed the people.
Rear them but don't own them.
Work but don't claim;
Lead but don't butcher.
Call this inward virtue.
