Beneath-heaven has a beginning:
The mother of beneath-heaven.
Knowing the mother.
We may know the children.
Knowing the children,
We may keep to the mother.
Death of body? No risk!
Block the passages,
Shut the doors:
End of life? No fuss!
Open the passages,
Meddle with things:
End of life? No help!
See the small: that is insight.
Keep to weakness: that is strength.
Use the light: go back to insight,
Keeping away from calamity
And practicing the changeless.
