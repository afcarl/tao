When great ill-will is reconciled,
There remains ill-will.
How shall it be made good?
By the sage holding the left-hand tally
And laying no guilt on others.
If you have virtue, you do what you should.
If you have no virtue, you levy claims.
The Tao of heaven plays no favorites,
But it always succors the good.
