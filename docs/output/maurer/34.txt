The great Tao flow everywhere:
It can go to the right or the left.
The ten thousand things draw life from it,
And it does not deny them.
It completes its work
But takes no title.
It clothes and feeds the ten thousand things,
But does not own them.
You can call it small.
The ten thousand things return to it,
But it does not own them.
You can call it great.
Because it does not seek to be great,
Its greatness is accomplished.
