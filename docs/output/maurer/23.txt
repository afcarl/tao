Nature speaks little.
Squalls do not last the morning
Nor downpours the day.
What stirs them up
Heaven-and-earth!
Even heaven-and-earth
Does not long make a fuss.
How much less should men!
Therefore,
He who follows Tao is one with Tao.
He who follows virtue is one with virtue.
He who courts loss is one with his losses.
Tao is glad to get whoever comes to Tao.
Virtue is glad to get whoever comes to virtue.
Loss is glad to get whoever comes to loss.
When you are lacking in trust,
Others have no trust in you.
