True goodness is like water;
Water benefits the ten thousand things
But does not compete with them.
It stays in places disliked by man,
Therefore comes close to Tao.
For a dwelling keep to the ground.
In your heart keep to the deeps.
In dealing with others, keep to gentleness.
In speaking, keep to the truth.
In governing, keep to order.
In business, keep to efficiency.
In making moves, keep to the right pace.
If you do not compete,
You will not be faulted.
