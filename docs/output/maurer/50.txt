Going out is life;
Coming back is death.
The companions of life are thirteen.
The companions of death are thirteen.
For people moving toward the place of death
There are also thirteen.
How is that?
Because they live intently.
It is said that
He who preserves his life
Meets no tigers or wild buffaloes on the road,
Remains untouched by weapons in the wars.
In him, the wild buffalo
Finds no space for his horns,
The tiger no space for his claws,
The soldier no space for his blade.
How is this?
Because there is no place for death in him.
