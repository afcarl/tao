The brave in daring dies;
The brave in not-daring lives.
Of these two,
One helps, the other hurts.
Heaven may hate,
But who knows why?
This question stumps the sage.
It is the Tao of heaven
To conquer without competing,
To answer without speaking,
To attract without summoning,
To get results without hastening.
Vast is heaven's net and wide-meshed,
Yet nothing slips through.
