Look at it; you can't see it:
Call it shapeless.
Listen to it: you can't hear it:
Call it soundless.
Grasp at it; you can't hold it:
Call it bodiless.
These three are beyond scrutiny;
Therefore they blend into one.
Its upped side it not bright,
Its lower side is not dark.
Continually the can't-be-named goes on
And comes back to nothingness.
Call it the formless form,
The imageless image,
The obscure.
From in front, you don't see its head.
From behind, you don't see its back.
But hold onto the Tao of old
And you can handle today's nowness.
Knowing the primal is the key to Tao.
