The Tao is the Innermost of all life,
The treasure of the virtuous who is centered therein,
And the refuge of the non-virtuous who has gone astray.
Beautiful words arising from the Tao will find an appreciative audience,
Noble deeds arising from the Tao will make great contributions to people,
And even if a person may have gone astray,
the Tao will not abandon him.
Therefore, on the day a new emperor is crowned or new ministers installed,
Rather than rushing to offer them discs of jade or teams of horses,
Simply be still and show them the Tao.
Why did the ancients esteem the Tao so highly?
Did they not say that with the Tao,
Those who seek find what they seek
and those who go astray are forgiven?
This is why the Tao is esteemed as the greatest treasure of the world.
