The Kosmos is not humane;
Impartially, it treats all things as transitory.
The sage is not humane;
Impartially, he treats all people as transitory.
Manifesting the Tao Eternal,
The kosmic space is like a bellows.
Empty, yet inexhaustible,
The more one activates it, the more it generates.
Being full, too many words lead one nowhere;
Impartially, keep to the silent core of emptiness.
