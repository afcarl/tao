Thirty spokes share a hub;
The usefulness of the cart
lies in the space where there is nothing.
Clay is kneaded into a vessel;
The usefulness of the vessel
lies in the space where there is nothing.
A room is created by cutting out doors and windows;
The usefulness of the room
lies in the space where there is nothing.
Therefore,
The benefit of things lies in the usefulness of nothing.
