Act from the still fulcrum of non-action,
Engage from the still fulcrum of non-engagement,
Experience from the still fulcrum of non-experience.
Regard the insignificant as significant,
Regard the minor as major,
Requite the unkind with kindness.
Meet the difficult while it is still easy,
Solve the major while it is still minor.
Difficult problems of the world always arise from easy ones,
Major issues of the world always arise from minor ones.
Therefore, the sage never deals with major issues,
Yet his action always leads to major accomplishment.
Those who commit lightly are seldom to be trusted.
Those who assume things to be easy are always met with difficulties.
Therefore, the sage assumes everything to be difficult,
And ends up having no difficulty at all.
