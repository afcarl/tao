To cease unnecessary learning is to be free from unnecessary concerns.
How much difference is there between yes and no?
How much distinction is there between good and bad?
Must one fear what everyone fears or value what everyone values?
In all this, there is no universality, and thus no end to confusion.
Jolly are the masses in chasing after excitement,
As though feasting at a royal feast, or
Ascending a high tower on a spring day.
Quiet am I by abiding in the stillness of being,
Like a newborn babe as yet to even smile,
Being here and now, and having nowhere to go.
The masses all hoard more than they need.
Forgetful of possessing, I alone am bereft.
My mind is like that of a fool, for I know nothing.
The ordinary man is bright, while I alone seem dark.
The ordinary man is clear, while I alone seem muddled.
Without boundary, I am like the vast ocean,
Without restriction, I am like a gentle wind.
The masses all have things to do;
I alone remain stubbornly unoccupied.
Thus, I am uniquely different from the rest,
Honoring the Tao from which I take my sustenance.
