What is firmly established within cannot be uprooted.
What is firmly embraced within cannot be disengaged.
The Tao, thus firmly established and embraced within you,
Will be respected for generations to come.
Cultivate the Tao in your character,
Then its virtues will be genuine.
Cultivate the Tao in your family,
Then its virtues will abound.
Cultivate the Tao in your community,
Then its virtues will endure.
Cultivate the Tao in your country,
Then its virtues will flourish.
Cultivate the Tao in the world,
Then its virtues will pervade.
Therefore, you can observe the virtues of the Tao,
In your character, if you cultivate it in your character;
In your family, if you cultivate it in your family;
In your community, if you cultivate it in your community;
In your country, if you cultivate it in your country;
And in the world, if you cultivate it in the world.
How can you know how the state of the world is?
Simply by thus observing.
