Heaviness is the center of lightness.
Stillness is the master of commotion.
For this reason,
The sage may travel the whole day,
Yet stays centered, without leaving his heavy baggage cart.
Or he may enjoy a splendid view,
Yet stays serene, calmly transcending all outward pleasures.
Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots behave lightly before all under Heaven?
One who behaves lightly loses one's center.
One who behaves agitatedly loses one's mastery.
