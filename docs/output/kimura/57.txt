Govern a nation with enduring justice.
Command troops with unpredictable moves.
Lead the world with empowering noninterference.
How do I know this to be so?
From witnessing the following:
The more restrictions there are in the world, the poorer people become.
The more weapons people possess, the darker nations become.
The more cunning and cleverness there is, the more there are anomalous things.
The more rules and regulations there are, the more there are thieves and robbers.
Therefore the sage says:
I take no action, and people are naturally transformed.
I delight in stillness, and people naturally do what is right.
I do not interfere, and people on their own prosper.
I have no greed, and people on their own return to simplicity.
