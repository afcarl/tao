The embodiment of the Tao Eternal,
The ancient masters are wondrously subtle and profoundly penetrating.
The depth of their being is unfathomable and beyond comprehension.
As their depth is unfathomable and beyond comprehension,
Only their appearance can be incompletely described:
The master is as alert as a person fording a winter stream,
As careful as a person watchful of his surroundings,
As respectful as a thoughtful guest,
As flowing as melting ice,
As plain as an unhewn log,
As empty as an open valley,
As inclusive as turbid waters.
Who could keep still until turbid waters become clear of their own accord?
Who could stay calm until still waters become alive of their own accord?
Those who embody the Tao do not desire to extend themselves to the fullest.
For, the Tao is balance,
and there is no fullest, no extreme.
Therefore, through balance, they refill their essence and renew their life force forevermore.
