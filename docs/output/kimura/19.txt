Abandon the relative notions of holiness and wisdom,
And people will benefit a hundred-fold.
Abandon the outer codes of benevolence and rectitude,
And people will return to natural filiality and kindness;
Abandon the unbalanced acts of cleverness and profiteering,
And there will be no robbers or thieves.
By looking within,
Evince the inner self,
Embrace the unadorned truth;
Diminish the outer self,
Demolish the phantasmic desire.
Abandon the external search for knowledge,
Abolish the internal worry for illusory matters.
