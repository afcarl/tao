Those who want to take control of the world by force can never succeed,
For the world is a sacred vessel of dynamic energy, not meant to be controlled.
Those who try to forcibly control it will ruin it.
Those who try to forcibly keep it will lose it.
Because life is not a static entity but a dynamic process,
Sometimes one moves ahead and sometimes follows behind.
Sometimes one works hard and sometimes takes rest.
Sometimes one grows strong and sometimes grows weak.
Sometimes one is supported and sometimes is unsupported.
Wherefore, the sage, knowingly moving with the dynamic flow of life,
Avoids extremes, avoids extravagance, and avoids excess.
