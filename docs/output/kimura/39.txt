In ancient times, these attained wholeness:
Heaven attained wholeness and thereby became pure.
Earth attained wholeness and thereby became tranquil.
Spirits attained wholeness and thereby became divine.
Valleys attained wholeness and thereby became full.
Beings attained wholeness and thereby became alive.
Leaders attained wholeness and thereby all was put aright.
Everything is what it is by virtue of its wholeness.
Heaven without purity would rend.
Earth without tranquility would collapse.
Spirits without divinity would dissipate.
Valleys without fullness would desiccate.
Beings without aliveness would perish.
Leaders without magnanimity would fall.
Humility is the basis of magnanimity.
Modesty is the fundament of exaltation.
Those in high position call themselves powerless, unworthy, or destitute.
Is this not because they take humility as the basis of magnanimity?
There is no honor in displaying your honor.
Desire not either to be jingling like jade or to be stolid like stone.
