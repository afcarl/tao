To yield is to prevail;
To bend is to straighten;
To be hollow is to be full;
To die is to regenerate.
To have little is to receive much;
To have much is to be confused.
Wherefore,
The sage embraces the complementary oneness of existence,
And sets an exemplary pattern for the rest of the world.
He does not display his ability,
Therefore his being shines forth.
He is not self-righteous,
Therefore he becomes distinguished.
He does not take credit,
Therefore he becomes recognized.
He is not self-important,
Therefore he is made a leader.
He does not contend with the world,
Therefore the world does not contend with him.
The old admonition that "to yield is to prevail" is not an empty adage.
Truly, to yield is to prevail, and in prevailing, one returns to oneness.
