After the reconciliation of great hostilities,
Lingering resentment always remains.
Can this be considered a true reconciliation?
Therefore, the sage returns injury with kindness.
He takes the position of a giver,
And does not make claims upon others.
The virtuous relates to the world as if he owes the world.
The non-virtuous relates to the world as if the world owes him.
Though the way of Heaven is impartial,
It always supports those who live in harmony with it.
