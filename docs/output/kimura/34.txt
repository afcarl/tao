The Great Tao overflows everywhere in the universe.
It suffuses with life all beings that depend on it for their existence.
It accomplishes everything while remaining nameless.
It nurtures everything while claiming no mastership.
It desires nothing for itself, and is therefore called the Small.
It is the source whereto everything returns, and is therefore called the Vast.
Thus, the sage never thinks of claiming greatness for himself,
Yet, for this very reason, achieves true greatness.
