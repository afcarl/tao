He who embodies the fullness of the Tao is like a ruddy infant.
No poisonous wasps will sting him.
No fierce beasts will seize him.
No rapacious birds will maul him.
His bones are tender and muscles soft,
Yet his grip is tight.
He knows not of the union of male and female,
Yet, filled with vitality,
His manhood becomes vigorously erect.
He can howl all day without becoming hoarse,
Because he is the embodiment of perfect balance.
To know balance is to know the eternal.
To know the eternal is to be illumined.
To overprotect life is to invite sure disaster.
To overuse the mind is to invite lopsided strength.
To overdevelop a thing is to invite early decay.
All are out of balance, and thus contrary to the Tao.
Being contrary to the Tao, things soon cease to be.
