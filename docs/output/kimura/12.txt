The five colors blind the inner eye.
The five tones deafen the inner ear.
The five flavors dull the inner tongue.
In pursuit of outer pleasures,
Racing and hunting madden the inner mind,
Rare goods obstruct inner progress.
Therefore,
The sage attends to that which is within, not that which is without.
He lives from the center, not from the periphery.
