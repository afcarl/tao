The universe has an origin, the Matrix of Creation,
Functioning as the Mother of the world.
If you know the Mother, you will know her children.
If you know her children while abiding with the Mother,
Though your body may be dissolved,
Your life-energy will remain inexhaustible.
Close the cracks, close the doors of the senses,
Then, till the end of your life you will not be drained of energy.
Open the cracks and react to external stimulations,
Then, till the end of your life you will not be saved from suffering.
To perceive the subtle is enlightenment.
To abide in gentleness is strength.
Use your inner light to return to enlightenment
And you will not inherit any harm.
This is called "learning the eternal lesson."
