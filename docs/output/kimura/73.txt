Courage in daring action will lead to death.
Courage in caring action will lead to life.
Of these two, one is beneficial and the other harmful.
Heaven does not favor harmful courage,
Yet, there are few who really know the reason.
Thus, the sage does not make light of this truth.
He who abides by the way of Heaven
Triumphs without fighting,
Responds without chattering,
Reaches out without being asked,
Plans ahead without being impetuous.
Though its meshes may appear wide,
Through the vast net of heavenly law,
Nothing can ever slip.
