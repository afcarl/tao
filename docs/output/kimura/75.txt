Why are the people starving?
Because the rulers eat up the money in taxes.
That is why.
Why are the people difficult to govern?
Because the rulers interfere too much.
That is why.
Why do the people think so little of death?
Because the rulers think too much of their own life.
That is why.
Those who do not overvalue their life are wiser than those who do.
