When the world recognizes beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
When the world recognizes good as good, evil arises.
Being and non-being create each other.
Difficult and easy define each other.
Long and short form each other.
High and low support each other.
Tone and voice accompany each other.
Before and after follow each other.
Hence,
the sage lives in the state of non-action - of eternal balance,
And teaches by the precept of silence - and through his silent deed.
He accepts things as they arise,
Creates without possessing,
Performs without depending,
Accomplishes without claiming credit.
Because he does not claim credit for himself,
His virtues endure forever more.
