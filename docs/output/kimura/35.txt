From the great formless imagining the world emerges into existence,
Without obstruction, but with balance, harmony, and peace.
Music and feast provide fleeting pleasures in this ephemeral world.
The Tao in its utterance brings no such pleasures to the senses.
The Tao, when looked at, cannot be seen by the eye.
The Tao, when listened to, cannot be heard by the ear.
Yet, when used, it is forever inexhaustible.
