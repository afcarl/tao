When a superior person hears the Tao,
He practices it committedly.
When a mediocre person hears the Tao,
He practices it sometimes, but just as often ignores it.
When an inferior person hears the Tao,
He roars with disparaging laughter.
If he did not laugh, it would not be the Tao.
Thus the age-old epigrams state:
The enlightening way appears dark.
The advancing way appears retreating.
The level way appears bumpy.
The highest virtue appears ordinary.
The purest goodness appears sullied.
The abundant virtue appears deficient.
The perfect virtue appears defective.
The most genuine appears insincere.
The greatest space has no corners.
The greatest talent ripens late.
The greatest voice is silent.
The greatest image is formless.
The Tao is hidden and has no name.
Yet the Tao alone bestows the power and fulfills the destiny of everything.
