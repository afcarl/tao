Those who know do not talk.
Those who talk do not know.
Close the openings of your senses,
Blunt the sharpness of your intellect,
Untie the tangles of your attachment,
Soften the brightness of your knowledge.
Be one with the dust of the world.
This is to be one with the Tao.
He who is one with the Tao cannot be courted, cannot be distanced, cannot be bought, cannot be harmed, cannot be honored, cannot be humiliated.
For this reason, he becomes the true treasure of the world.
