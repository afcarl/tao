Those who assist national leaders by means of the Tao,
Never use military force to make their nations world powers.
No action is ever without a repercussion:
Wherever an army is stationed, there grow briars and brambles.
Wherever a battle is fought, there follows a famine.
A good general in the direst necessity of a war
Achieves his purpose of winning the war,
But never seeks to gain power over others.
Therefore,
achieve your purpose, but only if it is called for;
Achieve your purpose, but never be haughty;
Achieve your purpose, but never be boastful;
Achieve your purpose, but never be supercilious;
Achieve your purpose, but never be overpowering.
Whenever something reaches an extreme in strength, it will inevitably decline.
This is called the way against the Tao.
The way against the Tao always leads to an early demise.
