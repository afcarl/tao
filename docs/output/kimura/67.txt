People say that my Tao is too immense and beyond compare.
However, because it is so immense, it is so different.
If it were not so different,
It would long ago have been reduced to something insignificant.
There are three treasures that I hold and cherish:
The first is tenderheartedness.
The second is thrift.
The third is daring not to be first in the world.
From tenderheartedness comes courage.
From thrift comes generosity.
From humility comes leadership.
If you try to be courageous without being tenderhearted,
If you try to be generous without being thrifty,
If you try to be a leader without learning humility,
You are courting your own self-destruction.
Venture with tenderheartedness and you will win the battle.
Defend with tenderheartedness and you will be invulnerable.
For tenderheartedness is the way Heaven guards you for your inner protection.
