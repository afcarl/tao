When the learned is not over esteemed,
There will not be unnecessary competition amongst people.
When the treasure is not over valued,
There will not be acts of stealing amongst people.
When we do not show people things that stir up their wants,
Their minds will not be disturbed.
Therefore, the sage governs the people by
Restoring balance in value and worth, through
Emptying people's minds and filling their essence,
Weakening their ambition and strengthening their character,
Freeing them from knowledge and wants, and
Keeping the learned from over exercising their authority.
Act in accordance with the principle of non-action - of eternal balance,
Then order will arise of itself.
