The person of authentic virtue makes no issue of his virtue.
Therefore, he is virtuous, wholly and completely.
The person of inauthentic virtue makes much issue of his virtue.
Therefore, he is not virtuous, wholly and completely.
Authentic virtue is a matter of being, not of doing.
Therefore, the person of authentic virtue makes no claims for his virtuous action.
Inauthentic virtue is a matter of doing, not of being.
Therefore, the person of inauthentic virtue makes claims for his virtuous action.
Superior benevolence is a matter of doing.
Yet the person of superior benevolence makes no claims for his benevolent deeds.
Superior rectitude is a matter of doing.
And the person of superior rectitude makes claims for his righteous deeds.
Superior etiquette is a matter of doing.
But the person of superior etiquette,
If people do not conform to his standard,
Will pull their elbows and force them to conform.
When the Tao is lost, then comes virtue.
When virtue is lost, then comes benevolence.
When benevolence is lost, then comes rectitude.
When rectitude is lost, then comes etiquette.
Etiquette is but the attenuation of probity and the beginning of disorder.
Prescience is but a flower of the Tao and the beginning of nescience.
For this reason,
The person of character dwells in the depths within, not in the shallows without.
He dwells in the fruitful substance within, not in the flowery embellishment without.
He thus chooses the inner and discards the outer.
