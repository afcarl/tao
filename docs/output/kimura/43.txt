The softest under heaven always prevails over the hardest.
For, having no fixed form,
It can penetrate even where there is no visible opening.
This is the power of balanced action through nonaction.
This is the benefit of balanced action through nonaction.
Nonaction teaches without words, and benefits without actions.
No power in the world can even come close to it.
