Weapons are instruments of ill omen; all creatures abhor them.
Therefore, the man of the Tao never abides in them.
The virtuous man usually honors the left, the positive,
But, when called to be in a battlefield, honors the right, the negative.
Weapons are instruments of ill omen,
Not instruments of the virtuous man.
Therefore, when he is compelled to resort to them,
He uses them with utmost restraint and calmness.
He does not glorify victory, for glorifying victory means to take delight in killing.
And whosoever takes delight in killing will never find success in this world.
On occasions for celebration, the positive left is given priority,
On occasions for mourning, the negative right is given priority.
The lieutenant stands on the left, and the general on the right.
That is, they stand in accordance with mourning ritual.
The killing of masses of human beings we bewail with deep sorrow and grief.
The victory in battle we observe with rites of mourning.
