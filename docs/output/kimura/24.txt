A man who tiptoes cannot stand.
A man who straddles cannot walk.
A man who flaunts himself cannot shine.
A man who is self-righteous is not respected.
A man who is self-boasting is not acknowledged.
A man who is self-conceited is not promoted.
From the viewpoint of the Tao,
These behaviors are like excess food and excrescent flesh.
Creation abhors such imbalance,
And thus the man of the Tao does not abide in them.
