With clear, appreciative discernment,
I choose to walk the great way of the Tao,
And fear naught save going astray.
The great way is very smooth and straight,
Yet people prefer uneven and winding by-paths, and thus go astray.
Therefore, in the world that has gone astray,
While the courts are clean and decorated,
The fields are untilled and the granaries are empty.
If the ruler wears fancy clothes,
Carries around sharp swords,
Indulges in extravagant food and drink,
And possesses more riches than he needs,
He is indeed a brazen bandit.
This is contrary to the great way of the Tao.
