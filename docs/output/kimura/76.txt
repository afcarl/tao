Human beings are soft and supple at birth,
But stiff and hard at death.
All things in Nature are soft and pliant when alive,
But dry and withered when dead.
Thus, the stiff and hard is the companion of death,
And the soft and supple is the companion of life.
Therefore, an army that is unyielding will soon perish,
And a tree that is unbending will soon break.
The hard and unyielding is an inferior quality;
The soft and yielding is a superior quality.
