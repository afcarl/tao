The master in his action is so complete
that he leaves no trace behind.
The master in his conversation is so balanced
that he leaves no discord behind.
The master in his thinking is so original
that he depends on no external authority.
The master in protecting people is so skillful
that, without any visible means, he renders all attempts for invasion ineffectual.
The master in uniting people is so adept
that, without any visible means, he renders all efforts for disunity ineffectual.
Thus, the master, without abandoning anyone, is always good at empowering people
And, without abandoning anything, is always good at utilizing things.
This is the all-embracing wisdom of the Tao.
Hence, the virtuous is the teacher of the non-virtuous,
While the non-virtuous serves as the lessons for the virtuous.
If you value not your teacher or cherish not your lessons,
No matter how intelligent and informed you are, you are greatly deluded.
This is the essential, subtle truth of the Tao.
