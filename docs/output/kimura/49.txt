The sage does not have a set mind.
His mind is unconditioned, and
He regards the minds of all people as his own.
He is good to those who are good.
He is good to those who are not good.
For his virtue is goodness itself.
He is in integrity with those of integrity.
He is in integrity with those without integrity.
For his virtue is integrity itself.
The sage, to serve this world,
In compassion merges his mind with all minds.
People rivet their eyes and ears upon differences amongst them.
The sage, with childlike innocence, sees one humanity in all.
