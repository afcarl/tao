In accordance with the Tao Eternal,
Embrace your body and mind in oneness without any diremption.
Enliven your vital energy until it reaches the suppleness of a baby.
Cleanse your mind to eliminate all unclarity.
Love your people and lead your community without unbalanced action.
Be receptive as a gentle female in the rhythmic intercourse of the Kosmos.
Remain in the state of not-knowing
while achieving knowledge in all fields.
This is the spiritual virtue of the Kosmos:
Birthing life without possessing,
Nurturing life without expecting,
Rearing life without dominating.
