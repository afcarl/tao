Having knowledge, yet being aware of the unknown, is superior intelligence.
Not having knowledge, yet pretending to know, is intellectual stagnation.
To be aware of stagnation is to be free of it.
The sage is free of any stagnation,
because he is keenly aware of all stagnation.
Therefore, he is forever free of stagnation.
