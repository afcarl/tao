The strategist par excellence says:
Dare not to be the aggressor but rather to be the defender.
Dare not to advance an inch but rather to retreat a foot.
This is called
Letting the opponent march toward nowhere to which to march,
Letting the opponent capture nothing to be captured,
Letting the opponent attack none to be attacked,
Letting the opponent arm with weapons for nothing for which to arm.
There is no greater calamity than underestimating your opponent.
To underestimate your opponent is surely to lose your treasures.
Therefore, when opposing forces are engaged in conflict,
The one who yields with caution will triumph in the end.
