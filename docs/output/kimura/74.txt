If the people do not fear death,
For reasons of extreme poverty or suffering,
What is the point of threatening them with death?
If the people fear death,
And if the outlaws are captured and killed,
Who will dare to break the law?
Yet, the act of killing should always be
The exclusive province of the Great Executioner.
Therefore, to kill in place of the Great Executioner is
Like hewing wood in place of the master carpenter;
Few, if ever, will escape cutting their own hands.
