Which is more precious, fame or health?
Which is more important, health or wealth?
Which is more painful, gaining or losing?
The more excessive is your attachment,
The greater is your suffering.
The more excessive is your possession,
The heavier is your loss.
To know what is enough is to be free from disgrace.
To know when to stop is to be free from danger.
Those who practice this will long endure.
