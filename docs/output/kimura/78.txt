Nothing under heaven is as soft and yielding as water.
Yet, for attacking the hard and strong,
Nothing is better and nothing is like it.
The yielding overcomes the unyielding;
the soft overcomes the hard.
Everyone under heaven knows this,
yet no one puts it into practice.
Therefore, the sage says:
He who absorbs as does water the detritus of the people
is the worthy master of the nation.
He who flows as does water with the tides of the troubled land
is the worthy king of the nation.
Truth seems often paradoxical and against common sense.
