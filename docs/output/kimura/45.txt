Great perfection appears imperfect,
Yet there is no end to its process of perfecting.
Great fullness appears empty,
Yet there is no limit to its process of fulfilling.
Great uprightness appears bent,
Great mastery seems clumsy,
Great eloquence sounds awkward,
Yet they keep growing without limitations.
Movement overcomes stagnation.
Stillness overcomes discordance.
Movement and stillness in balance
Set the world in evolutionary order.
