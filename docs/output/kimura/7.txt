Heaven is eternal and earth everlasting.
They thus endure forever,
Because they exist not for themselves
But for the whole, selflessly.
Whereby the sage,
Existing selflessly for the whole,
Puts himself behind and thereby finds himself foremost,
Holds himself outside and thereby finds himself inmost.
He has no self apart from the whole,
Wherefore he realizes the self that is the whole.
