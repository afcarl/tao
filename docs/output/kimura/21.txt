The outer expression of great virtue
follows the inner subtlety of the Tao.
Yet,
the inner subtlety of the Tao
is altogether elusive and ineffable.
Elusive and ineffable, yet there arises some image within;
Ineffable and elusive, yet there exists some thing within;
Cavernous and dark, yet there is some essence within;
This essence is entirely real; in it is Kosmic Integrity.
Hitherto, the name of Kosmic Integrity has endured,
And remains the Principle of Kosmic Creation and Decreation.
By what means do I know the Principle of Kosmic Creation and Decreation?
By means of Kosmic Integrity itself.
