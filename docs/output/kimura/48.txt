The practice of ordinary learning increases complexity daily.
The practice of the Tao increases simplicity daily.
Simplicity leads to more simplicity,
Until it reaches the state of pristine nonaction.
Then nothing is done, yet nothing remains undone.
Thus, one who wins the world does so
By not meddling with it, through nonaction, with simplicity.
One who loses the world does so
By meddling with it, through action, with complexity.
