The Tao does nothing,
Yet it leaves nothing undone.
If the leaders of the world abide by it,
All beings of their own accord will transform themselves.
If in the course of self-transformation discordant desires arise,
Calm them with the unnameable simplicity of the Tao.
If calmed with the nameless simplicity of the Tao,
Discordant desires of their own accord will disappear.
If discordant desires disappear and quietude is restored,
The world of its own accord will order itself.
