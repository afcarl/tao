To be silent is natural, for silence alone endures in Nature.
A whirlwind does not last the whole morning;
Nor does a downpour last the whole day.
Nature cannot make her commotion last;
Nor can human beings make their commotion last.
Therefore, in enduring silence, without commotion,
The master creates harmony with all humanity,
Sharing the experience of the Tao with those who embody the Tao;
Sharing the experience of virtue with those who practice virtue;
Sharing the experience of loss with those who lose virtue.
Thereby, in sharing the experience,
Those who embody the Tao enjoy his company;
Those who practice virtue enjoy his company;
Those who lose virtue enjoy his company.
The master is silent, for he knows the Tao and trusts the universe.
Therefore, be silent, then you will be enduring;
Trust, then you will be trusted.
