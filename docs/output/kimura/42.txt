The Tao, the wholeness, gives rise to oneness.
Oneness gives rise to complementary unity.
Complementary unity gives rise to complementary trinity.
Complementary trinity gives rise to everything in existence.
Everything consists of the complementarity of yang in the center and yin surrounding it.
From the balanced interchange between the two arises equilibrium in disequilibrium.
Ordinary people hate nothing more than to be powerless, unworthy, or destitute.
Yet this is what people in high position call themselves.
This means, in accordance with the principle of complementarity,
That to lose is to gain and to gain is to lose.
Let me repeat what others have taught:
The strong and violent, being out of balance, do not die natural deaths.
This is the very foundation of my teaching.
