Life is appearance; death is disappearance.
Three out of ten live a long life.
Three out of ten live a short life.
Three out of ten bring upon themselves an untimely death,
Because they cling too much to outer pleasures of life.
He who maintains a balanced life in accordance with the Tao,
Does not meet tigers or rhinoceroses in the wilderness,
Does not suffer attacks from the enemy in the battlefield.
Upon him the tiger has no place to fasten its claws,
The rhinoceros has no place to jab its horn,
The weapon has no place to pierce its blade.
Why is this so?
Because in him there is no room for death to enter.
