My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practice,
Yet the people of the world can neither understand nor practice them.
My words point to a source and my deeds a master,
Yet the people of the world know neither the source nor the master.
Thus, they know not who and what I am.
But for the few who know, I am precious.
Therefore, the sage may wear coarse clothes,
But will always hold a luminous treasure within.
