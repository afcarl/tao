Before the birth of Heaven and Earth is Being, formless yet complete.
Silent and still,
All one and unchanging, all present and unending,
It may be regarded as the Matrix of the Universe.
Its true name is unknown,
So we call it by its alias, the Tao,
And name it by its designation, the Great.
Being great, it extends without limit,
Extending without limit, it is far-reaching,
Being far-reaching, it returns to itself.
The Tao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
And Man is also great.
These are the four greatnesses of the Kosmos,
And of them Man is one.
Man patterns after Earth,
Earth patterns after Heaven,
Heaven patterns after the Tao,
And the Tao patterns after that which is natural.
