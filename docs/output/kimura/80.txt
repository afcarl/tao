Let there be small countries with few people.
Let the people take the matter of life and death seriously,
And let them not move too far from their birthplaces.
Even if there are complicated devices,
Let there be no necessity to use them.
Even if there are boats and carriages,
Let there be no reason to ride them.
Even if there are armors and weapons,
Let there be no occasion to display them.
Let the life be so simple that
The people return to tying knots for keeping records.
Let them be delighted with plain food, pleased with simple clothes, satisfied with modest homes, joyous with natural customs.
Though they may gaze across at a neighboring country,
hearing the barking of its dogs and crowing of its roosters,
they are so happy and satisfied where they are
that they will not visit one another until the end of their days.
