What is ultimately to be compressed must first be expanded.
What is ultimately to be weakened must first be strengthened.
What is ultimately to be discarded must first be promoted.
What is ultimately to be taken away must first be given.
This is the subtle light of wisdom.
The soft overcomes the hard.
The weak overcomes the strong.
The fish should never leave the water.
The formed should never leave the formless.
