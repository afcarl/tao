If people do not revere the Law of Nature,
It will inexorably and adversely affect them.
If they accept it with knowledge and reverence,
It will accommodate them with balance and harmony.
Therefore, the sage, in harmony with the Law of Nature,
Knows himself but does not flaunt his knowledge,
Loves himself but does not exalt his status,
Accepts where he is without complaint,
Enjoys what he does without dislike.
Thus, he rejects imbalance and disharmony,
And chooses balance and harmony.
