Governing a big country is like cooking a small fish.
The more you stir the pot, the less the fish stays intact.
If the world is guided by the Tao,
Even evil spirits are rendered spiritless.
Not that evil spirits are in themselves spiritless,
But their spirits do not harm people.
Not only do evil spirits not harm people,
But powerful rulers also do not harm people.
When no harm is done from either side,
Virtue accrues to both and all return to pristine oneness.
