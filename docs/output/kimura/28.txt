Knowing the strength of the masculine principle,
Yet remaining in the lovingness of feminine virtue,
One becomes the stream of life to which other streams conjoin.
In thus becoming the stream of life for the world,
One comes to embody perennial virtue,
And returns to pristine innocence.
Knowing the purity of kosmic harmony,
Yet remaining in the impurity of worldly discord,
One becomes the standard of life by which other people can live.
In thus becoming the standard of life for the world,
One comes to reaffirm perennial virtue,
And returns to inner infinity.
Knowing the glory of public acclaim,
Yet remaining in the obscurity of personal humility,
One becomes the valley of life in which other people can repose.
In thus becoming the valley of life for the world,
One comes to fulfill perennial virtue,
And returns to undivided simplicity.
Undivided simplicity is reduced to mere usefulness through division.
Remaining undivided, the sage makes masterful use of the divided,
And is made the leader of an organization.
Thus, the great organization led by a sage is undivided and whole.
