When the government is inwardly contained and disciplined,
The people become wholesome and good.
When the government is outwardly demanding and exacting,
The people become tense and cunning.
Fortune rests on misfortune.
Misfortune hides in fortune.
There is no end to their perpetual cyclic interchange.
Likewise, there is nothing that is permanently fitting.
What is fitting eventually becomes unfitting.
What is proper eventually becomes improper.
Not knowing the complementarity inherent in cyclic interchange,
People's delusion of permanence tends to last for a long time.
Thus, knowing the dynamic balance existing in complementarity,
The sage chooses what is right without being divisive,
Points out what is true without being critical,
Straightens out distortions without overextending them,
Enlightens others without dazzling them.
