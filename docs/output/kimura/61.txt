A great country is like a low-lying estuary,
A place where the myriad streams of the world come together.
She is also like a receptive female drawing in an eager male.
The female always conquers the male through her stillness,
Because she knows how to lie low through her stillness.
Thus,
a great country can win over a small country by lying low.
A small country can also win over a great country by lying low.
Therefore, one may either win over or be won over by taking the lower position.
A great country only wants to embrace and nourish more people.
A small country only wants to be embraced and serve her benefactor.
Thus, both can achieve their ends by practicing humility.
Therefore, especially a great country must practice humility.
