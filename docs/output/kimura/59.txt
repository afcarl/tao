In governing people and serving heaven,
There is nothing better than thrift.
Thrift means expeditiously regaining balance after expending resources.
Expeditiously regaining balance means continually accumulating virtue.
Continually accumulating virtue means increasingly becoming invincible.
Increasingly becoming invincible means knowing that everything is possible.
One who knows that everything is possible is fit to govern people.
The mother principle of governing people holds good for a long time.
This is called deepening the root and firming the foundation,
Which is the way of long life and lasting vision.
