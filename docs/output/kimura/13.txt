Honor and disgrace both startle people.
Undue significance is attached to such tribulations
as though they were matters of life and death.
Honor and disgrace both startle people,
Because honor means higher and disgrace means lower in the opinion of others.
Hence,
they become startled with pleasure when honor is given,
And they become startled with displeasure when honor is taken away.
Undue significance is attached to such tribulations
as though they were matters of life and death,
For people think the physical self is real.
If people realize the unreality of the physical self,
How can they attach significance to such tribulations as honor or disgrace?
Therefore,
only one who values the world as oneself is fit to tend the world;
Only one who loves the world as oneself can be entrusted with the care of the world.
