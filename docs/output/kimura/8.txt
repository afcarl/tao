The highest good is like water,
Benefiting all but contending with none,
Flowing in low places which the masses disdain.
Hence, it is close to the goodness of the Tao.
In dwelling, be grounded,
In thinking, be deep,
In giving, be balanced,
In speaking, be truthful,
In governing, be orderly,
In working, be competent,
In action, be timely.
In following the virtues of water,
The sage contends with no one,
And therefore he invites no troubles in life.
