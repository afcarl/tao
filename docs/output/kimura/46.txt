When the world follows the Tao,
Horses are used to fertilize the farm fields.
When the world does not follow the Tao,
Even mares are expended to breed in the battlefields.
When the individual follows the Tao,
Energy is used in his harmonious inner development.
When the individual does not follow the Tao,
Energy is expended in his continuous inner conflict.
There is no greater vice than giving in to greed,
No greater calamity than not knowing contentment,
No greater imputation than succumbing to covetousness.
Therefore, know and be content with what is enough,
Then you will always have enough.
