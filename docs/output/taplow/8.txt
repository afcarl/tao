The highest good of mankind, is like water -
- Without competition, gives Life to All Things.
- Flowing, it seeks and dwells in places rejected by mankind.
Thus it approaches close to the Tao.

Accordingly, the Sage -
- In dwelling, Seeks closeness to the earth.
- In heart, Seeks that which is profound.
- In relationships, Seeks gentleness and kindness.
- In speech, Seeks sincerity and truthfulness.
- In government, Seeks justice, order and peace.
- In business, Seeks ability and competence.
- In movement and action, Seeks timeliness.

The Sage -
Remaining free from competition and contention,
Is without blame - beyond reproach.
