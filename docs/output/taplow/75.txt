People are starved of body,
When the government taxes to excess.
People are starved of spirit and become unruly,
When the government, by over-control, interferes with the natural rights of mankind.
Being so starved of both body and spirit,
Their leaders demanding so much of living life,
Little remains upon which to live.
People know better than to place too much value upon life.
