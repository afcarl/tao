Favor and glory as well as disfavor and disgrace,
All cause pain in equal measure. -
As disfavor and disgrace cause pain,
Possessing favor and glory -
The fear of its loss is ever present.

What we value and what we choose to fear
Are both contained within our body/selves.
We possess fear because we have a body/self.
Ceasing to acknowledge the body part of self,
Nothing of significance remains to be feared.

The leader -
In honoring and loving his responsibilities
as he honors and loves the body/self,
Can be entrusted with the leadership
of his domain.
