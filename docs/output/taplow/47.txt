Everything under heaven may be known by
Searching no further than one's doorstep.
All ways of heaven may be known
Despite shutters blacking the window's view.

The further one pursues knowledge by
traveling apart from the unity of the Tao,
The less is one's true knowledge and understanding.

The Sage:
Knows without searching about.
Understands without looking about.
Wu-Wei ! - Doing nothing, all is attained.
