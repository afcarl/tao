Expansion grows from contraction.
Strength grows from weakness.
Construction grows from destruction.
Receiving grows from giving.
Being the subtle law of nature,
Softness and gentleness overcome the hard and the strong.

As fish are preserved by hiding in the deep,
Preserve your weapons of survival from the view of the Idle Curious.
