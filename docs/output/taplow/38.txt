The person known to have superior Te,
Has it as a result of natural instinct.
Possessing true virtue, acting naturally - never overtly,
Has no inner need to be regarded as virtuous.

The person known to have inferior Te,
Needs to make an overt display of virtue. Being in truth without Te - acts with overt display,
So to appear virtuous to others.

The person known to have superior kindness and humanity,
Acts effortlessly, with natural instincts.

The person known to have a superior sense of strict justice and righteousness,
Needs to act with overt display of power.

The person known to favor strict adherence to rite, ritual and ceremony,
When taking action and failing to obtain a response,
Attempts to force adherence, using violence

Sequentially: If people stray from the Tao, They tend to emphasize Te.
If Te is lost, They will rely on kindness and humanity.
That being lost, Strict justice and righteousness appear.
That, being of no effect, Resort to rite, ritual and ceremony.

Rite, ritual and ceremony are the mere shell of true faith and loyalty -
The beginnings of disorder, chaos and confusion.
These human characteristics, being merely a superficial aspect of one's true essence,
Are a beginning of folly.

Thus the Sage:
Knowing what to accept and what to reject -
Dwells upon the substantial,
Not upon the superficial.
Upon the fruit, not the flower.
