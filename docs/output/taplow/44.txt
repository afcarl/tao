Does one's life and self character matter more than fame?
Is one's Life and self character treasured more than wealth?
Is loss of spiritual things more painful than gain of material things?

Hence:
Being attached to things while grudging expense,
One ultimately pays most dearly.
Hoarding most heavily,
One ultimately loses most heavily.
Being content,
One rarely suffers disappointment.
Knowing when to stop,
One is free from danger.

In this way, one is safe and can long endure.
