As a bow is bent, so bends the way of nature.
That at the top,
Bent downward toward the center.
That at the bottom,
Bent upward toward the center.
The string -
If too long, is shortened,
If too short, is lengthened.

The Tao of nature strives for equilibrium.
That which is abundant is reduced.
That which is deficient is supplemented.
Mankind, on the other hand, will often -
Further reduce what is deficient,
Supplement that which is abundant.

The Sage alone -
Having abundance, offers it to the world.
Works quietly without arousing attention.
Acts without claiming recognition or reward.
Has no desire to reveal his superiority.
