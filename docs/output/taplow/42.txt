One, an undifferentiated unity, Comes from the Tao.
One, differentiated, becomes two - Yin and Yang, I and Not I.
Thence, are three realized - Such are Te, Ch'i and Shen.
And from three, All Things arise.

Of All Things -
In carrying the Yin and embracing the Yang,
Through the blending of these energies, Harmony is achieved.

People disdain being orphaned, needy and worthless,
Yet leaders and rulers, to appear humble, have so named themselves.
By diminishing themselves, they often gain -
By overt attempts to gain, they often lose.

As the ancient spiritual teachers have said,
The person living by violence,
Shall surely die by violence.
