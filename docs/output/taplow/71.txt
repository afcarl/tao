Knowing you know not, is strength -
A high attainment.
Not knowing, yet thinking you know, is sickness -
A dire defect.
Only with knowledge of this sickness as a sickness,
Can the defect be removed.

The Sage has no sickness - no defect.
Recognizing sickness as sickness, defect as defect,
He is free from these curses.
