Can you:
Embrace oneness - Maintaining a unity of mind, body and spirit?
Control the Ch'i -
By concentration, cause it to be soft, as a little child?
Clear and purify inner mystic vision -
Spotless and without blur, creating perfection?
Govern and lead - openly, honestly and simply
The governed barely sensing your effect?
Handle "life's-gate" experiences of birth and death -
Maintaining the receptive principle of Yin?
Be open to All Things - with true understanding
Remaining detached, taking no action, not interfering?
Give birth and nourish All Things -
Seeking neither to lay claim nor possess?
Act and work -
Seeking neither credit nor reward?
Lead and assist -
Seeking neither to master nor dominate?

To do this is the primal virtue -
The profound and mysterious Te.
