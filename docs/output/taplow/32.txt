The Tao, eternal and nameless,
Is as an uncarved block -
Seemingly simple and insignificant,
Is inferior to nothing under the heavens.
If leaders were to embrace it within their own true natures,
Loyalty would come to them as effortlessly as
heaven and earth send the rains and dew.
There being no compulsion,
All would be in harmony.

Carving the block creates identity.
Identity causes names.
Names cause differentiation and distinction -
Harmony ceases.
Thus,
As names are perceived -
As distinctions among people arise -
Stop!
Knowing when to stop, danger may be avoided.

Tao in the affairs of the world is as natural as the rivers seeking the seas.
