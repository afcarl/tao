When neither the meritorious, worthy, gifted nor wise are exalted or rewarded,
Fighting, quarreling and contention become unnecessary.
When treasure, rare objects and belongings are not accumulated, valued and prized,
The rewards of thievery cease to have meaning.

When desirable things are not seen nor displayed,
The hearts of people are not troubled, excited or confused.
The Sage governs himself and leads others by:
- Encouraging the heart to be open and free from desire.
- Providing sustenance for the stomach.
- Calming the will to strive for the sake of striving.
- Strengthening the body.

Thus, keeping all, innocent and free of knowledge and desire,
The Sage discourages the cunning from harmful action.
Wu-Wei -
Action unforced -
Permitting all to just happen,
by itself,
without effort.
