A small, intimate, sparsely populated community,
Was thought by its ruler to be an ideal easily controlled state.
Labor saving devices and life's necessities,
Existing in abundance,
Were not used or needed.
Being satisfied with the quality of life,
There was no need to search for better things.
Having boats and carriages,
There appeared no use for them.
Having arms and weapons,
There was no occasion for their employment.
Being simple,
The commerce of the community required
no greater means than knotted cords
to ease the accounting of transactions.
Thus the people were:
- Satisfied with their food.
- Content with their clothing.
- Comfortable with their shelter.
- Happy with their customs and traditions.
Even though neighboring communities
were within sight and earshot of cocks and barking dogs,
They would leave each other in peace while they would grow old and die.
