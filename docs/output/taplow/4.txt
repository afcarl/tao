Tho' Tao is empty - its grace is inexhaustible
A deep and unfathomable source,
The ancestor of all there is.

Through the Tao: - Rough edges are smoothed.
- Hard knots are untied.
- Glare of light is softened.
- Busyness of life is tempered.

Tho' hidden deeply - it is ever present.
Its origin ? - A mystery to me.
It just seems to have been forever.
