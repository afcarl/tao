Nature is impartial -
While regarding All Things of the universe
as sacred,
Graces them with equality.
Likewise, the Sage is impartial -
While regarding all creatures as sacred,
Graces them with equality.

The universe - a moving bellows - Yin and Yang
always emptying - always full,
Endlessly working - endlessly yielding forth.

Understanding the nature of the universe
by words and by intellect,
Leads to exhaustion.
Hold instead to that intuition which,
Rising from the gut of mankind,
Resembles original nature.
