Discard and abandon formalized wisdom and knowledge,
And hundredfold benefits accrue.

Discard and abandon conventionalized righteousness, duty and morality,
And be graced with natural harmony.

Discard and abandon cunning skills - legalized profiteering,
And robbery as well as deception disappear

These three, of themselves insufficient -
Consider then,
- Original simplicity.
- Unadorned nature.
- Selflessness.
- Limited desire.
