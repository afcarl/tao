Should the people have no fear of death,
Threatening them with such a penalty,
Is the essence of futility.

Should the people fear death,
Be there any among them who would commit a crime,
Knowing death to be the penalty ?

Who then, is comfortable as the executioner ?
Is not nature the wisest judge regarding timeliness for one to die ?

To otherwise kill in defiance of nature
is to be as an apprentice carpenter performing complicated hewing for his master.
In performing a task unsuited to his natural level of skill,
He is certain to be injured.
