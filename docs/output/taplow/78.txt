Flowing water -
Being softer and more yielding than all else under the heavens,
Has no equal in attacking and prevailing against that which is hard and resistant.
The supple, weak and yielding, thereby,
Conquer the rigid, strong and resistant.
While this is known by all mankind,
Few are they who can flow in this manner.

Thus the Sage -
By accepting the disgrace and humiliation of the community,
Is called a leader in the community.
By receiving the burdens and misfortunes of the nation,
Becomes a ruler of the nation.

Surely these words, while paradoxical, are true.
