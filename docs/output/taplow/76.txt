At birth, as in life, mankind is gentle, soft and weak.
In death, he becomes hard and rigid.
All creatures and All Things -
While alive and growing are soft and supple.
When dead, become withered, tough, brittle and dry.
Hard, rigid, withered, tough, brittle and dry,
Being companions of death -
Gentle, soft, weak and supple are
Companions of life.

Thus -
The hard weapon will be broken.
The hardwood tree will be cut down.
The hard and the mighty are cast down.
The soft and the weak are exalted.
