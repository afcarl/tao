The greatest warrior shuns the violence of war.
The greatest fighter shuns the display of anger.
The greatest conqueror shuns overt competition.
The greatest leader is humble with his people.

Thus is the power of non-contention.
Thus is the capacity to utilize people well.
Thus is the ancient ultimate unity with heaven.
