To act without acting; to be busy without being busy; to taste without tasting;
to look equally on the great, the small, the many and the few; to be indifferent to thanks and reproaches; this is how the Sage acts.
He only sets about difficult complications through their easiest details, and only applies himself to great problems in their weak beginnings.
The Sage never undertakes anything great, and that is why he makes great things.

He who promises much, cannot keep his word; he who embarrasses himself with too many things, even easy things, never succeeds in anything.
The Sage keeps clear of difficulty, therefore he never has any difficulties.
