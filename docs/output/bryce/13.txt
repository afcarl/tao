Favour, because it can be lost, is a source of worry. Greatness, because it can be ruined, is a source of fear.
What do these two sentences mean? The first means that the care required to keep in favour, and the fear of losing it, fill the mind with worry.
The second points out that ruin generally comes from caring too much for one's own greatness. He who has no personal ambition does not have to fear ruin.
He who is only concerned about the greatness of the empire (and not that of himself), he who only desires the good of the empire (and not his own good), to him the empire should be confided (and it would be in good hands).
