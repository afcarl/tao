The essential for co-operation with heaven in the government of men, is to moderate one's action.
This moderation should be the prime care. It procures perfect efficacy, which succeeds in everything, even the governing of the empire.
He who possesses this mother of the empire (wise moderation), will last a long time.
It is called the pivoting root, the solid trunk. It is the principle of perpetuity.
