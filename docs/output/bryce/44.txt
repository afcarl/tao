Is not the body more important that reputation? Is life not of more consideration that wealth? Is it wise to risk a great loss for a small advantage?
He who is a great lover, wears out (his heart). He who amasses great wealth, heads toward ruin (by theft or confiscation).
Whereas he who is modest courts no disgrace; he who is moderate does not perish, but endures.
