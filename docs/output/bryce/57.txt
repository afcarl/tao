One can govern with rectitude, one can wage war with competence, but it takes non-action to win and hold the empire. How do I know that this is so? From what I am going to say:
The more rules there are, the less people enrich themselves. The more taxes there are, the less order there is.
The more ingenious inventions there are, the fewer serious and useful objects there are. The more detailed the penal code, the more thieves abound. Multiplication ruins everything.
Therefore the programme of the Sage is quite the contrary. Not acting, And the people amend themselves. Staying peaceful, And the people rectify themselves.
Doing nothing, And the people enrich themselves. Wishing for nothing, And the people come back to natural spontaneity.
