Everyone has the idea of beauty, and from that by opposition that of not beautiful (ugly).
All men have the idea of good, and from that by contrast that of not good (bad).
Thus, being and nothingness, difficult and easy, long and short,
high and low, sound and tone, before and after, are correlative ideas, one of which, in being known, reveals the other.
That being so, the Sage serves without acting and teaches without speaking.
He lets all beings become, without thwarting them, he lets them live, without monopolizing them, and lets them act, without exploiting them.
He does not attribute to himself the effects produced, and in consequence these effects last.
