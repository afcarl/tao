If the people are hungry, it is because the prince eats up excessive sums of money (which he extorts from them).
If the people are restive, it is because the prince does too much, (indisposes them by his innovations).
If the people expose themselves lightly to death (in hazardous enterprises), it is because he loves life too much, (love of well-being, of pleasure, of fame). He who does nothing in order to live, is wiser than he who harms himself in order to live.
