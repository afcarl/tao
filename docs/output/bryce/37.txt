The Principle is always non-acting (not acting actively), and yet it does everything (without seeming to participate).
If the prince and the lords could govern like that (without poking their fingers in it), all beings would become spontaneously perfect (by returning to nature). It would only remain to call them back to unnamed nature (to the primordial simplicity of the Principle) each time they showed any tendency to come out of this state (by acting). In this state of unnamed nature there are no desires.
When there are no desires all is peaceful, and the state is governed by itself.
