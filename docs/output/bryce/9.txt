To hold a vase filled to the brim, without spilling anything, is impossible; better not to fill it so.
To keep an over-sharpened blade without its edge becoming blunt, is impossible; better not to sharpen it to this extreme.
To keep a roomful of precious stones, without any of it becoming misappropriated, is impossible; better not to amass this treasure.
No extreme can be maintained for a long time. Every height is followed by a decline. Likewise for a man. Whomsoever, having become rich and powerful, takes pride in himself, prepares thereby his own ruin.
To retire at the height of one's own merit and fame, that is the way of heaven.
