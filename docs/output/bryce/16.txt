He who has reached the maximum of emptiness (of indifference) will be firmly fixed in peace.
Innumerable beings come out (from non-being), and I see them return there. They spring forth, then they all return to their root.
To return to one's root, is to enter into the state of rest. From this rest they emerge for a new destiny, and so it goes on, continually, without end. To recognize this law of immutable continuity (of the two states of life and death), is wisdom. To ignore it, is foolish. Those ignorant of this law cause misfortune (through their untimely interference in things).
He who knows that this law weighs heavily on beings, is just (treats all beings according to their nature, with equity), like a King, like Heaven, like the Principle.
In consequence he lasts until the end of his days, not having made himself any enemies.
