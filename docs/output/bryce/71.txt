Knowing all and believing that one knows nothing, is true knowledge (of a superior kind). Knowing nothing and believing that one knows everything, is the common evil of humans. Seeing this evil as an evil, keeps one away from it.
The Sage is exempt from self-conceit, because he dreads it. This fear keeps him from it.
