By dint of holding oneself on tiptoe, one loses one's balance. By trying to take too great a stride, one does not go forward.
By making a show of oneself, one loses one's reputation. Through imposing oneself, one loses one's influence.
Through boasting about oneself, one becomes discredited. Through pushing oneself, one ceases to be augmented.
In the light of the Principle all these ways of acting are odious, distasteful. They are superfluous excesses. They are like a pain in the stomach, a tumour in the body. He who has principles (in conformity with the Principle), does not act like this.
