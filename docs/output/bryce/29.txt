He who holds the empire would, in my view, be wishing for failure should he want to manipulate it (to act positively, to govern actively).
The empire is a mechanism of extreme delicacy. It should be let go all alone. It should not be touched. He who touches it, deranges it. He who wishes to appropriate it, loses it.
When he governs, the Sage lets all people (and their sum, the empire) go free according to their several natures, the agile and the slow, the ardent and the apathetic, the strong and the weak, the long-lived and the short-lived.
He limits his action to the suppression of excesses which would harm the whole, such as power, wealth, and ambition.
