When a man is born he is supple and weak (but full of life); he becomes strong and powerful, and then he dies.
It is the same for plants, delicate (herbaceous) at first, then becoming woody at the time of their death.
He who is strong and powerful is marked for death; he who is weak and flexible is marked for life.
The great army will be defeated. The great tree will be cut down.
Everything that is strong and great is in a poorer condition. The advantage is always with the supple and the weak.
