The ancients used to say, "The one who yields becomes whole." In giving up everything, you gain everything. In emptying your mind, it becomes full. In becoming partial you become whole. Teach by acting, not by lecture. Be like the un-carved block. Do not contend or defend. Then people will see themselves in you. Do your work each day then rest.
