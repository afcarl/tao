Are good and evil different? Do I fear what the next man fears? Such wretchedness. Do not follow who is in front of you for he may fall off a cliff! Drift like a leaf blowing in the wind. Flow like water around an obstruction. Clear your mind and throw your desires away. Nourish yourself in the Dao.
