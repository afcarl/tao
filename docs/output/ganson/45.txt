The most perfect seems imperfect,
but it endures with constancy.
The greatest fullness seems empty,
but it cannot be exhausted.

The most straight seems twisted.
The most skillful seems clumsy.
The most eloquent seems awkward.

Movement overcomes cold,
stillness overcomes heat.
The serene and passive are guides for all.
