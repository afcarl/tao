There is a danger in extremes:

Pull a bowstring too far,
and you wish you had let go before.
Hone a sword-edge too sharp,
and the edge will wear too soon.
Fill your house with gold and jade,
and you invite thieves.
Be proud and arrogant over good fortune,
and you prepare your own downfall.

When you have reached your goal,
be satisfied to go no further.
This is the way of Tao.
