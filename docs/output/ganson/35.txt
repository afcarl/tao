The world will follow, without fear of evil,
serene, peaceful, secure,
one who follows the great symbol of Yin-Yang.

Music and good food will stop the passing stranger,
but Tao, offered by the spoken word,
seems unappealing, tasteless.

Looked for, it cannot be seen;
listened for, it cannot be heard;
applied, it cannot be exhausted.
