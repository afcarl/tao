Thirty spokes unite at the hub of a wheel
but the ultimate use of the wheel
depends on the part where nothing exists.

Clay is molded into a vessel
but the ultimate use of the vessel
depends on the part where nothing exists.

Doors and windows are cut from the walls of a house
but the ultimate use of the house
depends on the part where nothing exists.

So there is advantage in using
what can be seen, what does exist.

There is also advantage in using
the invisible, the non-existent.
