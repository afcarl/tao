To Lead, Appear to Follow

Why do rivers and seas have dominion over lowlands?
Because the one lowers itself to the other.

To be elevated by the people,
speak like their inferior.
To lead the people, walk behind them.

Thus the truly wise are above,
but people do not feel their weight.
They walk in front,
but people do not feel blocked.

The whole world respects
and never grows tired of such leadership.
Because the truly wise are not aggressive,
no one attacks them.
