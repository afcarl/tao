The heavens endure; the earth is very old. Why?
Because they do not exist for themselves,
they therefore have long life.

The truly wise are content to be last;
they are therefore first.
They are indifferent to themselves;
they are therefore self-confident.

Perhaps because they do not exist for themselves
they find complete fulfillment.
