Tao causes all things to exist; Teh sustains them.
Reality gives them form; fate completes them.
Thus all things honor Tao and respect Teh
of their own accord.

Teh sustains all things in existence.
It fosters growth, develops them,
harbors them, provides shelter.
It nourishes them, gives protection.

Everything exists through Tao
and nothing is rejected.
Everything is produced through Tao
but Tao is not possessive.
Tao is superior but never interferes.
