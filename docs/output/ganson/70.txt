My teachings are easily understood
and readily put into practice.
Yet not everyone understands them,
not everyone practices them.

Words have specific origins,
deeds specific controls.
Not having such knowledge,
people do not know me.
Being unknown, honor is mine.
Unknown, I am distinguished.

The wise wear common clothes
and carry jewels in their hearts.
