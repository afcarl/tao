Simplicity an Ancient Standard

The ancient followers of Tao
did not use it to increase knowledge,
but rather to preserve simplicity.

People are difficult to govern
when there is too much knowledge.
Whoever rules a country by furthering knowledge
is that nation's curse.
Whoever rules a country by furthering simplicity
is that nation's blessing.

To know these two principles
is to know the ancient standard.
To know the ancient standard
is to possess Teh of a certainty.

Teh is deep and vast as infinity.
It returns us to primal peace.
