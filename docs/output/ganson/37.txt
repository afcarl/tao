Tao never acts directly;
it activates everything.
If rulers would do likewise,
the world would improve of itself.

But when improving, motives show.
These should be restrained by motiveless Yin.

Motiveless Yin is free of all desire.
Being free of desire is to be serene.
Being serene, the world is at peace.
