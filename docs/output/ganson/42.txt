Out of Tao comes Unity; out of Unity comes two;
from two comes three; from three all things come.

The shade of Yin is on the back of everything;
the light of Yang is on the face of everything.
From their blending together
balance exists in the world.

To feel unworthy, to be alone, orphaned,
is greatly feared and disliked,
yet statesmen claim these feelings.
Loss sometimes benefits; benefits can be a loss.

Others have taught this too:
the violent meet violent ends.
This is a good teaching.
