Nature is indifferent to life.
It realizes everything is as a straw dog
(a sacrificial animal-image).
The truly wise are also indifferent to life.
They realize humanity is as a straw dog.

The universe is like a bellows:
empty, yet quite full.
As it proceeds, it produces.

Much talk, much exhaustion.
Keep your thoughts within!
