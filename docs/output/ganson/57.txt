Be Lawful, Not Full of Laws

Rule by what is right.
Wage war by clever strategy.
Win the world by being passive.
How do I know? By this:

More restrictions mean weaker people.
More weapons mean a troubled state.
More cunning means many surprises.
More laws mean more violators.

Be passive and the people will be reformed.
Be serene and the people will be righteous.
Be peaceable and the people will be wealthy.
Be selfless and the people will be simple and serene.
