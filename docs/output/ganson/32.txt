Tao is absolute, nameless.
A piece of wood, uncarved, natural,
cannot be used by anyone.
The leaders who can be genuine and natural as this,
gain the respect of the people.

The heavens and the earth join and gentle rains fall,
beyond anyone's command, to everyone equally.

When civilization grew, names began.
With names, one should know where to stop.
Whoever knows this has security.

In the world Tao is like rain
that falls into the rivers
and thence to the open sea.
