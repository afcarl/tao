One of courage, with audacity, will kill.
One of courage, but gentle, spares life.
From these two kinds of courage
arise harm and benefit.

Even if Tao dislikes certain people,
who can say why?
The truly wise regard this
as a most difficult question.

Tao does not contend but it surely wins,
does not speak but it surely responds,
does not command but things come of themselves.
It is empty yet contains the master plan.

The net of Tao is all-encompassing,
its meshes are wide, yet nothing is lost.
