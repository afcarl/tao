The truly wise are selfless.
People's needs are their needs.

The good are treated with goodness;
the bad are also treated with goodness;
this is the goodness of Teh.

The faithful are treated with faith;
the faithless are treated with faith;
this is the faith of Teh.

The truly wise live peacefully and impartially.
In their eyes people share a common heritage.
The truly wise accept all people as their own family.
