Lead With a Deep Unity

From past ages there has been Unity:
the heavens achieved it and became clear,
the earth achieved it and became firm,
the valleys achieved it and became fertile,
the spirit achieved it and become inspired,
all things achieved it and became existent,
leaders achieved it and became good rulers.

Without clarity the heavens would be tempestuous,
without firmness the earth would tremble,
without fertility the valleys would dry up,
without inspiration the spirit would be lost,
without existence all things would vanish,
rulers would falter and fall.

Thus good leaders are humble.
The high are founded on the low
just as a chariot is made up of many small parts.

Better to rumble like rocks (have depth)
than to jingle lightly like jewels (be flighty).
