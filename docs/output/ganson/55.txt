Whoever has Teh is like a child:

Poisonous insects will not bit.
Wild animals will not attack.
Predatory birds will not strike.

Bones soft, muscles weak, but gripping strongly.
Unconcerned about sex yet most vigorous.
Crying out all day long but not hoarse.

This involves perfect harmony.
Knowing harmony is to approach the eternal.
Knowing the eternal is to be enlightened.

To become excitable leads to confusion.
To freely vent emotions is to be aggressive.

Things reach their prime and then decline.
To be impatient is to oppose Tao.
Whatever opposes Tao dies young.
