To Govern, Be Gentle

Govern passively, the people are happy.
Govern precisely, the people are restless.

Happiness arises from unhappiness;
unhappiness lies beneath happiness.
Who knows what is best?

When the state is self-righteous,
self-righteousness becomes strategy
and good becomes evil.
Man has long been misguided.

The truly wise are:
square (sharp-cornered) but not cutting;
angled (wedge-like) but not interfering;
straight (pointed) but not domineering;
bright (enlightened) but not binding.
