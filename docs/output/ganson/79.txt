Settling Disputes

Settling a great dispute leaves some hatred behind.
Can this be good?

Therefore the truly wise defend the weak
and do not seek vengeance.

The man with Teh fosters reconciliation;
the man without Teh fosters reaction.

And so it is truly said:
While Tao is impartial, it permeates good men.
