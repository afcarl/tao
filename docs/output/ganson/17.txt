The Best Leader

The best leaders, the people do not notice.
The next best, the people honor and praise.
The next, the people fear;
and the next, the people hate.

If you have no faith,
people will have no faith in you,
and you must resort to oaths.

When the best leader's work is done
the people say: "We did it ourselves!"
