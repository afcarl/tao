With Tao, You Are Supreme

In ruling men be reserved.
To be reserved is to conform to Tao.
To conform to Tao is to achieve Teh.
With Teh anything is possible.

Because anything is possible,
no one knows your supremacy.
Because no one knows your supremacy,
a nation can be ruled well.

Because this is a Mother Principle
it long endures.
Therefore you are as deeply rooted
and as immortal as it is.
