Be humble; you will remain yourself.
Be flexible, bend, and you will be straight.
Be ever receptive, and you will be satisfied.
Become tired and weary and you will be renewed.

Have little, you will have enough;
to have abundance is to be troubled.

The truly wise seek Unity, embrace oneness,
and become examples for all the world.

Not revealing themselves, they shine;
not self-righteous, they are distinguished;
not self-centered, they are famous;
not seeking glory, they are leaders.

Because they are not quarrelsome
no one quarrels with them.

Thus it is as the ancients said:
"To yield is to retain Unity."
The truly wise have Unity,
and the world respects them.
