The beginning of the universe
may be considered the mother.
Knowing the mother the sons can be known.
Knowing the sons we can keep close to the mother.
Thus life has within itself security.

Eyes closed and mouth shut, life is without trouble.
Eyes open, busily conversant, life is without hope.

Whoever sees the most minute sees clearest.
Whoever cherishes the weak has the most strength.
Whoever uses enlightenment has bright vision.

Thus, no harm is done.
This is following Tao.
