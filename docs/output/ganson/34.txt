The great Tao is everywhere, on all sides.
Everything derives from it;
nothing is rejected by it.

Through Tao everything exists
yet it does not take possession.
It provides for everything
yet it does not lay claim.

Without motive it seems small.
Being the source of everything it is great.
Because it never claims greatness,
its greatness shines brightly.
