Whoever knows does not speak;
whoever speaks does not know.

So, stop the senses.
Close their doors.
Solve their riddles.
Subdue their light.
Be one with humble dust.

This is the mystic unity.

It is beyond love and hate,
beyond profit and loss,
beyond honor and dishonor.
Thus it is the most valuable treasure
in all the world.
