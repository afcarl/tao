The scholar needs to know more and more each day.
The follower of Tao needs to know less and less each day.

By lessening knowledge one reaches inaction.
By inaction everything can be done.

The world is won by those who leave it alone.
When one feels compelled to dominate,
the world is already beyond reach.
