The great mass of people are content
as if at the sacrificial feast
or at the spring carnival.

I alone am serene, quiet, passive,
like a newborn baby unable yet to smile.
I am alone, like one who is homeless.

Others seem to have abundance
while I seem to live in contemplation.
Perhaps I am the fool, so obscure, so vague.

The masses seem bright and informed;
I alone seem dull and uninformed.
The masses are clever and smug;
I alone am simple and unassuming.
Alone, as if adrift on the lonely sea.

And others seem to have useful purpose;
I alone seem impractical and awkward.
I am alone, different.
I choose to be sustained by nature.
