Rule Without Interfering

The people starve
when rulers impose heavy taxes.
That is why people starve.

The people are rebellious
when rulers meddle in their affairs.
That is why people are rebellious.

The people do not fear death
when they try to lead a better life.
That is why they do not fear death.

Those who do not interfere with life
receive genuine value from it.
