Govern Peacefully

That which is to contract is first expanded.
That which is to weaken is first strengthened.
That which is to be felled is first reinforced.
This is subtle enlightenment.

Being gentle overcomes strength.
As fish should not leave the deep,
so the sharp weapons of the state
should always be hidden from view.
