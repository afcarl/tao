The Ideal State

The ideal state is small with few people.
It has abundance of goods, beyond possible use.
Understanding death, the people do not emigrate.

Though they have vessels and vehicles,
they do not travel far in them.
Though they have armor and weapons,
they have no need to display them.

Let them use knotted ropes for simple reckoning,
be satisfied with their food,
be attractive in their clothing,
be comfortable in their homes,
be happy with their customs.

Though from other states the dog's bark
and cock's crow can clearly be heard,
the people never leave the ideal state.
