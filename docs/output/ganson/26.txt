Heaviness (sincerity)
is the root of lightness (frivolity).
And serenity far surpasses hastiness.

The truly wise can travel all day
yet never put down their baggage
(a pun alluding to depth or heaviness of spirit).
Though there be appealing distractions
they remain serene, passive, undisturbed.

How can a leader of ten thousand chariots
make his rule obscure, insignificant?

To be light is to lose the root of lightness;
to be hasty is to lose self-mastery.
