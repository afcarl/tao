Whenever the truly wise hear of Tao
they strive earnestly to use it.
Whenever the mediocre hear of Tao
they are aware, yet unaware of it.
Whenever the stupid hear of Tao they laugh aloud at it.
If it were not laughed at it would not be Tao.

Therefore it is said of Tao:
enlightenment seems dullness;
progress seems regression;
the true path seems misleading.

The highest character seems recessive like a valley;
the purest virtue seems tarnished;
the most adequate seems somehow insufficient;
the most firm seems frail;
the most fundamental seems changeable.

Great space has no corners;
great ability takes time to mature;
great music is soft and mellow;
great form is shapeless, contourless.

Tao is hidden; it is nameless;
yet it stimulates; it brings fulfillment.
