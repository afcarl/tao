Life leaves and death enters.

Three and ten parts accompany life;
three and ten parts accompany death;
three and ten parts move toward death.
(Four limbs plus nine orifices.)

Why? The wear of the drive to live.
Why? Living tips the balance toward dying.

It is said that whoever realizes this
is not attacked by the wild buffalo or tiger
and is not vulnerable on the field of battle.
The buffalo's horns find no place to gore,
the tiger's claws no place to tear,
the soldier's weapons no place to pierce.

Why? Because death is not yet within reach.
