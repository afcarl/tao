Tao is a vast immeasurable void.
It can be used to infinity.
It is truly inexhaustible.

Like nature, it appears to be the origin of everything.
In it, conflicts (sharp edges) are satisfied (rounded).
Differences (tangles) are resolved (untied).
Observations (light) are clarified (tempered).
Disturbances (turmoil) are quieted (submerged).

It is like a deep dark pool.
I do not know its source.
It is like a prelude to nature,
a preface to God.
