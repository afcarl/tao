The world says:
"Tao is great but seems so foolish!"
It seems foolish because it is great.
If it did not seem so foolish
it would long since have lost its value.

I have three treasures.
Guard them and keep them safe!
The first is love,
the second is moderation,
the third is humility.

From love one gains courage,
from moderation one gains ability,
from humility one achieves greatness.

To forsake love and courage,
to forsake moderation and ability,
to forsake humility and rush to the forefront,
is death to all hope.

With love battles can be won,
with love defense proves invulnerable,
with love heaven arms those it would protect.
