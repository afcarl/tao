Achieve the highest goal by being passive;
hold close to a state of perfect serenity.

Everything comes into existence,
but observe, returns to its source.
Thus, vegetation flourishes and grows,
but returns to the soil whence it came.

Returning to the source is serenity;
it is to realize one's destiny.
To realize one's destiny
is to know the Eternal Constant.
To know the Eternal Constant
is to be enlightened.
To be ignorant of this
is blindness that begets evil.

Whoever knows the Eternal Constant
is open-minded. Being open-minded
is to be impartial. Being impartial
is to be above nations and laws.

Being above nations and laws
is to be in accord with nature.
Being in accord with nature
is to be in accord with Tao.
Being in accord with Tao
is to be eternal.

Although his body may die and decay,
he shall live forever.
