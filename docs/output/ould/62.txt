The Tao is the sanctuary of all creatures in the world.
It is the good man's treasure, the bad man's refuge.
With high-sounding words honours are easily acquired;
With spectacular deeds credit is easily acquired.
But the bad must no be rejected either.
Therefore: when an emperor is enthroned,
And the three Ministers are appointed,
He who comes bearing gifts of jade,
Followed by a retinue of four horses,
Should be less highly prized than he who, without moving, brings the gift of the Tao.
Why was the Tao so highly prized by the Ancients?
Was it not because this could be said of it:
He who seeks it shall receive it,
Sinners seking it sahll be freed from sin.
That is why they thought it the most precious of all things.
