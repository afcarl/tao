Rule a great kingdom as you would cook a small fish - gently!
If the Tao ruled in the world, evil spirits would not work their malignant powers.
Not that the evil spirits would lsoe their powers;
No! But their powers could do no harm to men.
They would do no harm;
Nor would the Sage harm himself by callin gon his spirits to do the people harm.
Therefore. Since neither of them harmed the other,
Their powers would unite in a common cause.
