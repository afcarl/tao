If people are not awestruck by that authority which rightly claims their awe,
Be sure a greater fear, the fear of death, will not let them escape.
But do not confine them within narrow walls,
Not interfere with their lot;
If you refrain from despising htem, you will not be despised by them.
Thus it is with the Sage:
He knows himselfr, yet makes no parade of himself.
He loves himself, yet does not overrate himself.
Indeed, he disregards That and nurtures This.
