A great strategist has said: "I will not issue a challenge, but being challenged will give a good account of myself.
Rather than advance an unnecessary inch I will retire a foot."
This might be called:
Marching by standing still;
Baring the arms, but not raising them to fight;
Keeping the hand on the hilt of the unsheathed sword;
Being prepared for battle, but not engaging the enemy.
No calamity could be greater than that which results from underestimating the enemy.
To underestimate the enemy is to risk the loss of one's greatest treasure - life itself.
Thus it is that when enemies meet in battle, the side that deplores the conflict will most surely be victorious.
