A great kingdom is like the low-running stream to which all rivers flow down: the centre towards which all
converge.
It plays the female part.
The female overcomes the male by quiescence: she puts herself beneath the male.
Similarly, a great kingdom that puts itself beneath a small kingdom gains the adherence of the smaller;
A small kingdom, because in the natural order of things it is below a great kingdom, gains the adherence of the
greater.
The one gains by becoming lowly and putting itself beneath, the other gains by being naturally lowly.
Thus: if the great kingdom desires only to add to the population it already nourishes,
And the small kingdom desires only to unite and serve,
Then both of them assume the positions they desire.
But it is the greater of the two that should seek the lowly position.
