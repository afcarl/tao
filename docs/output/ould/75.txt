If the people go hungry it is because their betters ruin them with taxes:
That is why they must grow hungry.
IF the people are hard to govern it is because their betters meddle in their affairs:
That is the only reason why they are hard to overn.
If the peoplemake light of death it is because they are so absorbed in the task of living:
That is why they make light of death.
And indeed they who set too little store by life are at any rate wiser than they who value it too dearly.
