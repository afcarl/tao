"The government of a country is best achieved by carrying out the rules.
The winning of wars is best achieved by the employment of artful strategy."
But the winning over of the community is best achieved by non-interference.
How do I know that this is so?
By This.
The more the people are forbidden to do this and that,
The poorer they will be.
The more sharp weapons the people possess,
The more will darkness and bewilderment spread through the land.
The more craft and cunning men have,
The more useless and pernicious contraptions will they invent.
The more laws and edicts are imposed,
The more thieves and bandits there will be.
Hence these sayings of a Sage:
"If I work through Non-action, the people will transform themselves.
If I love the Stillness, the peole will grow righteous of themselves.
If I do not fuss or interfere, the people will grow wealthy of themselves;
If I am free from desire, the people will return to unspoiled simplicity.
