The captain who is most accomplished does not make a display of warlike zeal;
The best fighter is not angry;
He who is most capable of conquering does not engage the enemy;
He who is most capable of using men places himself in a position inferior to them.
This may be called the Virtue of Non-striving,
The power to use men;
It is to work in consort with heaven itself,
And attain the highest ideal of the Ancients.
