In the ruling of men and the serving of Heaven nothing equals moderaiton.
For moderations leads to foresight in concerving;
Foresight in conserving leads to the storing of treasures of power.
The strength of one who has stored such treasures of power cannot be overcome.
As nothing can overcome it, its potency is boundless.
Because its potency is boundless,
Its possessors can attain sovereignty over the whole kingdom.
And if, having attained sovereignty, he returns to the Mother,
He will endure long.
For by striking deep roots he will be building on firm foundations,
And through contemplation he will repose in the Eternal Tao.
