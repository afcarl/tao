Whenthe government seems hesitant and lacking in vitality,
The people are free and happy.
When the government is active nad interfering,
The people are discontented and critical.
"Misery," it is said, "rests on happiness, and happiness underlies misery";
But who sees that there is a supreme state where nothing is imposed?
For if right action becomes mere expediency
And belief in goodness becomes mere superstition,
The peole wil pass their days in a fog of bewilderment.
Therefore the Sage:
Though square himself, does not seek to shape others;
Thought he has his own angles, he does not ask others to match them;
Though he is himself straight, he does not seek to stretch others;
He shines, but he does not make a display of himself.
