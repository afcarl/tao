That which is motionless can be easily held;
That which has not been forecast can be easily planned;
Hat which is still tender can be easily broken;
That which is minute can be easily scattered.
Take things in hand before they come into existence;
Put things in order before they are in a state of confusion.
The tree which fills your arms' embrace brew from a tine shoot;
The nine-storey tower arose from a heap of earth.
The journey of a thousand miles began with the spot of earth covered by one's own feet.
He who acts, spoils. He who grasps, loses.
The Sage does ot act: therefore he does not spoil things.
He does no grasp; therefore he does not lose things.
But ordinary people, eagerly going about their business,
Often fail when the are on the verge of succeeding.
Keep watch on the end as well as on the beginning;
Then you will not fail.
Therefore the Sage:
Desires only the undesiring;
He does not value things that are hard to come by.
He learns how not to learn,
Turning back to those things which others have passed through,
And thus helps all creatures to fulfil their own natures.
But he does not venture to act.
