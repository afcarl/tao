Oceans and mighty rivers are as kings to all the valleys, because they lower themselves to thelevel of the valleys:
That is why they are as kings of the valeys.
Therefore the Sage, if he would be above the people, must in speech seem to put himself below the people.
IF he would lead the people, he must place himself behind them.
Thus: although he is above the people, he is not a burden to them;
Although he goes ahead of the people, he does not block their way.
Thus: the whole world willingly follows and esteems him and is not irked by him.
And because he does not contend, no one contends with him.
