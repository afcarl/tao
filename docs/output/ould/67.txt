All the world declares that the Tao of which we speak may be supreme, but nevertheless it baffles definition.
Indeed, it is because it is supreme that it baffles definition.
If it had been definable it would have long since become as negligible as the conventions.
These are my three treasures, which I prize and protect:
The first is compassion; the second is moderation; the third is, not to attempt to be the first among men.
If you are compassionate, you can be truly brave;
If you are moderate, you can be truly generous;
If you do not attempt to be the first among men, you can become the chief of ministers.
But nowadays, if you are brave it is at the expense of compassion;
If you are generous, it is at the expense of moderation;
If you lead, it is at the expense of humility,
And this is death.
For he who fights with compassion will conquer;
He who defends with compassion will hold fast;
Heaven will save him and protect him with compassion.
