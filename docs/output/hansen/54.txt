Culture it in one self
and its virtuosity is authenticity.
Culture it in a family
and its virtuosity is sufficiency.

and its virtuosity is wealth.
Culture it in the social world
and its virtuosity is universality.

'Family' to view the family.
'Village' to view the village.
'State' to view the state.
'Social world' to view the social world.
