The Tao functions like a bending bow. When something is gained, something else is lost. If there is excess here, there will be deficiency there. A rich man, who takes more from those who are lacking, will become deficient in the Tao. The master gives, therefore he has. He doesn't need recognition and acts with no thought of reward. With no thought of reward, everything he does is rewarding.
