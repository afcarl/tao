A tall tree requires deep roots, otherwise it will topple. If a problem is prevented, it doesn't arise. If your attainment is brittle it will easily shatter. Small things are easily lost. Don't take short cuts, but deal with everything fully before moving on. If you do this your progress will be steady. A mighty oak rises out of an acorn. A human develops out of a microscopic egg. A thousand mile journey starts with one step. These processes cannot be completed in one act. If you try to make something great happen and overlook the processes involved, you will fail. Only by letting the process play out naturally can you achieve the Tao. Therefore the master doesn't try to achieve. He simply follows the process calmly from start to finish. Death is stalking him, so he has nothing to cling to. His only desire is non-desire; his only learning is to unlearn. He shows people what they have always been. He loves nothing except the Tao. Therefore he can love everything.
