If you know, you don't talk. If you talk, you don't know. Don't speak of the Tao. Don't indulge your senses. Don't be arrogant. Drop all beliefs. Lose self-importance. Dismiss all knowledge. Here you reach non-duality. Once enlightened, you have no friends or enemies. You cannot be rewarded or punished. You cannot be honoured or disgraced. Detached from self, you can be called a real human.
