A father who trusts in the Tao doesn't force his children to do anything, and doesn't discipline them. He knows this would be against the natural way and would damage the children as well as himself. The master knows if force is used on a child, weeds will grow in the child's mind. Achievements may be apparent, but he will not boast or take pride in them. He knows they are attributed to the Tao, and no claimant exists. From here he simply moves on. This is the natural way.
