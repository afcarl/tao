If you are rooted in the Tao, you cannot be moved. If you hold to the Tao, time won't pass. You endlessly abide in the virtue of the Tao. When your life isn?t separate from the Tao, your true self is. When your family isn't separate, they will flower. When the earth isn't separate, it is abundant. When the universe isn?t separate, it is harmonious. From an atom, to the universe, there is no inside or outside. How do I know? By hearing with my eyes.
