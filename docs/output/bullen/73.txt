Acting passionately can lead to trouble. Being indifferent, there is no trouble. The reasons why things happen can hardly be known, so we can't know if something is good or bad. By not trying to succeed, everything is successful. Without speaking, everything is said. By not seeking, it can be found. The natural way covers everything and every event like a net. Though its meshes may be wide, nothing slips through.
