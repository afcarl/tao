The master needs no satisfaction, so his acts are always pure. An ordinary man demands satisfaction, so his acts are always tainted. The master is not a doer, so nothing is to be done. An ordinary man is a doer, so many things need doing. A man who tries to do the right thing creates more problems. A man who tries to do the moral thing will use force. If people can't act naturally, they may try to be good. If they can't be good, they may try to be moral. If they can't be moral, they may try to be fair. If they can't be fair they will conform. Conformity appears to be politeness and sincerity, but is really the realm of confusion and folly. The master dwells in the depths of reality. He considers the use of occult powers as foolishness. The miracle is the flower. The Tao is the fruit. Dwell in the fruit, for nourishment can only be found there.
