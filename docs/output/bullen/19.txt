Ideas of holiness and wisdom will hamper your progress. Ideas of morality and justice cannot replace what is written on people's hearts. The idea of profiting off others causes thieves to appear. Since these three ideas are man made, they are not eternal. Therefore they should be avoided. Patient, compassionate, and desireless, you are in step with the Tao.
