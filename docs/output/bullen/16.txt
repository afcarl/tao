Empty the mind by not thinking of gain or loss. Follow your heart in all matters and the mind isn't stirred. Even though the misery of others is apparent, you contemplate their ultimate destiny. That destiny is enlightenment. Being one with the Tao is enlightenment. Here you are serenely impartial. Being someone is a delusion. Here you are separate and confused. Impartial, you shine on existence like the sun, caring not what or who you shine on. At one with the Tao, birth and death cannot touch you.
