The master has separated from mind, and the great virtuous Tao is. The mind is like a foot. If it follows that which is greater it is useful. If it tries to lead of its own volition it will lead to disaster. The Tao is beyond conception, so drop all ideas. If you cling to anything it cannot provide nourishment. Neither inside nor outside, the Tao is non-dual. It can only be known by not knowing.
