When happy: Even if you have occult powers, they will not be used, You can achieve great works, but there is no need, You can travel far and wide, but you stay at home, You can become a great man, but you remain unknown, You can control people, but you leave them be. Joy is found in ordinary goings on. Even though you may be able to see the border to the next country, you are content to die of old age never having been there.
