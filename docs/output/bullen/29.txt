You cannot change the world, only yourself. The world is in constant natural change, how could you add to it? If you try to change it you will ruin yourself. If you treat it like an object, you objectify yourself. Simply follow the natural flow of the changes: Sometimes lead, Sometimes follow, Sometimes move, Sometimes stop, Sometimes be active, Sometimes be at rest, Sometimes be safe, Sometimes be in danger. The master knows the world is beyond his control, so lets things come and go without interfering. He is like a blade of grass: When the wind blows it bends with it. This way he is always centered and keeps his energy.
