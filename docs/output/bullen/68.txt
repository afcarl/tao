The best warrior isn't intent on killing. The best sportsman isn't concerned about winning. The best tactician enters the mind of his opponent. A true businessman works for the good of the community, not to rape them of their wealth and destroy the earth. A true leader has no agenda. Competition breeds violence. Peace can only be had by doing away with it.
