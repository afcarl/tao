The Tao is not big, but it contains all. If a father could follow the Tao, the children will be naturally compliant. Everything will be in perfect accord, and life will be sweet. If you create laws, you create lawlessness. If you trust the people the law will be written on their hearts. When you name something, you create division. Institutions are created to serve a common purpose. When the purpose is served they are no longer needed. Know when to stop to avoid conflicts. Everything flows into the Tao, as all rivers flow into the ocean.
