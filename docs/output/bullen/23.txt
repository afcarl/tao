To be limited in speech is natural. Clouds may come, but when they pass the sun shines through. Your words may come, but when they pass there is silence. This is the natural way of the Tao. When things come, let them. When things pass, let them. Following the natural flow you will embody the Tao. Virtue can be experienced by the virtuous. Those who lose the natural way become lost. If you don't trust in your natural responses, you make yourself untrustworthy.
