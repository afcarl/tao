Strive for more, and you lose what you have. Hurry ahead and you will miss something, and then have to go back. Boast of achievements, and they will be lost. Define who you are, and you will lose your true self. Try to control others, and you will be controlled by them. These traits represent wasted energy spent on the ego. The master has long done away with them.
