A father who is moderate is able to be a genuine support. Because he doesn't consider himself, his acts are full of virtue. Having no vision of the future, he is totally present. Without fixed ideas, he can fit perfectly to any situation.

The master has no self, therefore knows no limits. Even death cannot stop him.
