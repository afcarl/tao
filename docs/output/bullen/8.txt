To be truly good, be like water which benefits all without knowing. Men who aspire to ascend benefit no being. But all are benefited by the natural descent of water. This is like the Tao. So seek a dwelling for shelter. Think when the need arises. When you deal with others, do so with compassion. When you speak to others, don't lie. Work at a profession for self-refinement as well as livelihood. Lead your family by simply following them. When you follow the natural path no mistake can be made.
