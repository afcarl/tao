A great master is prepared for nothing, so is ready for anything. He trusts in the Tao and accepts he cannot control its movement. Realising its greatness, he serves it. Thus he is humble and feminine. Humble and feminine, he allows himself to be nourished by the Tao. Being nourished by the Tao, he himself becomes great. Greatness can only be achieved through humility.
