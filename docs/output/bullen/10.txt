To keep the mind balanced use the body. Breathe like an infant. Then cleanse the mind by letting go of ideas. Love people without interfering. Allow events to take their natural course. Detached from comings and goings the mind is clear. Don't bullshit yourself! By balancing it you nurture it, but it is not yours. Acting through it, but expecting no results. Perfection comes of its own accord.
