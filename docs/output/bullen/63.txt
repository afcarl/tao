Act without expecting results. Let the Tao do your work. Taste without tasting. Look at the big as small; think of the many as few. Have compassion for petty tyrants. Deal with things when they arise. Complete great works by gradually fulfilling them. To become a master of the Tao, take one step at a time. When your foothold is firm, the next step will come naturally. The master never aspires to greatness, but is immersed in every step. This is his greatness. Promises can be broken. What is easy can become difficult. The master realises he must ground his step before he can take another. For this reason, he never falls.
