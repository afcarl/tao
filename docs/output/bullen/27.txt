The master travels the natural path, which has no destination, and on which no tracks can be left. A good trader follows the market wherever it goes. A good teacher lets the students guide him. A master is present for all, both saints and sinners. All situations are used and nothing is dismissed. This is called spreading the light. A man, who considers himself good, must be intimate with that which is bad. A man, who considers himself bad, must know the good. Therefore the master sees no distinction between the two. For this reason the master and disciple are equal.
