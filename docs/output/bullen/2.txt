Beauty doesn't exist; Ugliness doesn't exist: except through the other. Good doesn't exist; bad does't exist: except through the other. Long doesn't exist; short doesn't exist: except through the other. High doesn't exist; low doesn't exist: except through the other. Before doesn't exist; after doesn't exist: except through the other. Inside doesn't exist; outside doesn't exist: except through the other. Profit doesn't exist; loss doesn't exist: except through the other. Therefore the master acts without setting a goal, and teaches that there is no teaching. Freedom from duality resides with him. Everything is his, but he has nothing. Every act is his, but he expects nothing. This is his accomplishment, which can never be destroyed.
