A master doesn't teach, but shows his disciples that what they think they know, they don't. If a person thinks they know, they are trapped in that knowledge. Once the master shows them not-knowing, they can guide themselves. At this stage the master's task is completed. The master doesn't try to show his prowess, but lets his disciples discover theirs. Therefore his disciples never resent him and simple allow him to point out their true essence.
