The master being at one with the Tao doesn't feel threatened when in danger. Even if surrounded by misery he is perfectly peaceful. People are excited by the sound of music or the taste of food. But they find words which try to point out the Tao flavourless. If you try to look for it, it cannot be seen. If you try to listen for it, it cannot be heard. Experience it, and it never ceases.
