The way of the master is simple, and easy to practice. But your mind cannot understand, and you can't try to attain it. Ordinary people are interested in the mundane world, and even if they hear of the Tao they don't grasp its depth. Few and far between are those who follow the way. They realise those who don't follow, aren't ready, so don't try to persuade them. Those who become ready have to lose all hope. Once all hope is lost, there is hope.
