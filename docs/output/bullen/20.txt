Without thinking, you cannot worry. There is nothing good or bad. You can neither succeed nor fail. The master may still think of good or bad, but he is aware that it is a thought and simply watches it pass. An ordinary man thinks of good or bad and believes it. This is the difference between enlightenment and delusion. Ordinary people try different hobbies in the pursuit of happiness. The master drifts around doing nothing in particular, indifferent like a baby before it can smile. Ordinary people have an identity. The master has none. Therefore he seems like an idiot. Ordinary people try to shine outwardly through their achievements. The master's achievements are not known by others. The intentions of ordinary people are evident. The master has no intentions. Ordinary people know what to do. The master doesn't. He drifts along like a cloud in the sky. He is different from ordinary people. He is nourished by the Tao.
