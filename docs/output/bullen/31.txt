Weapons generate fear; real humans loath them. Peace is the highest value. If it has been destroyed, utmost restraint is needed to restore it. Your enemies are people as well, so any battle is entered into gravely. Do not wish them personal harm. Do not rejoice in victory. Who would rejoice in the killing of men? Conduct a war as you would a funeral, it is a time of mourning. Weep for your enemy as you would for your friend.
