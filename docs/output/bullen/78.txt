Water is the softest thing in the world. But in dissolving things that are hard, nothing can better it. This is because it can't be broken, thus it endures. Everybody knows the soft is stronger than the hard, and the passive overcomes the aggressive, but few put this into practice. The master is humble, therefore he is great. Because he can follow, he is able to lead. Truth is paradoxical.
