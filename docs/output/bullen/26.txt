Something can only be heavy relative to something lighter. Movement can only occur relative to something unmoved. The master may travel all day, but remains motionless. There may be amazing sights, but he never looks. A father shouldn't act the fool, and ignore the needs of his family. If you take your responsibilities lightly, you lose the basis of your being. If you fall prey to restlessness you cannot be relaxed.
