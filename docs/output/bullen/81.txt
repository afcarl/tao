True words aren't beautiful. Beautiful words are not truthful. The wise do not argue. Those who argue are not wise. Those who know have no knowledge. Those with knowledge don't know. The master has nothing, but gives everything he has. The more he gives, the happier he is. Only with the Tao can you be fulfilled. The beginning doesn't exist; the end doesn't exist, except through the other. Is finishing verse eighty-one, the end, or the beginning? If you think it is the end, you need to read it again. If you think it is the beginning, you also need to read it again.
