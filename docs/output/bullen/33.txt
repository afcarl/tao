With intellect, you have knowledge of others. Enlightened there is no self. With force you can master others. By yielding you master the Tao. In striving to accumulate wealth, you become poor. In accepting what you have, you become rich. Do only what needs to be done and relax. If you accept death, you will live in eternity.
