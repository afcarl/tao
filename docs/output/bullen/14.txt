The Tao cannot be seen, so don't look for it. You can't hear it, so don't listen for it. It is no-thing, so don't try to touch it. Timeless and dimensionless, it cannot be named. But all things are contained in it. Subtle beyond understanding. It is a beginningless and endless present. Not trying to find it, you can be it. Look, here you are!
