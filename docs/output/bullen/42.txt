The Tao gave birth to the universe. The universe gave birth to the earth. The earth gave birth to man. Man gave birth to everything. Everything is experience, but receives a name. There is total harmony when name and experience combine. An ordinary man seeks a name in the eyes of others, but at their expense. The master experiences for himself. A violent man will not enjoy a natural death.
