Before the universe was manifest a perfect emptiness abided. It is eternally still and silent, but creates infinite things. Not having a name, I call it the Tao. Being indescribable, I call it great. Infinite things constantly flow through it, never ceasing. The Tao is great, The universe is great, The earth is great, Man is great. Man must follow the natural laws of the earth, The earth must follow the natural laws of the universe, The universe must follow the natural laws of the Tao, The Tao simply is.
