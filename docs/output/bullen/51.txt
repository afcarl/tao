For every being, the Tao is. Conscious existence comes naturally. Physical appearance is determined by circumstances. Therefore, the Tao is honoured by all without effort. All are born of it, and it provides their livelihood. It is the safe haven of life and the destination of death. It produces everything, but possesses nothing. Through it all opportunities arise, but it isn't involved. Its virtue is total, and its function is mysterious.
