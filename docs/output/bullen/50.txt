Ordinary people revolve in the misery of birth and death. The master is free from birth and death. A person is not born of existence, but born of societal conditioning. Ordinary people are like water which fears the death of freezing. The master is like H2O and welcomes the movement of one state to another as the natural course of things. Because he accepts death, he is always safe. Wild beasts or weapons cannot harm him.
