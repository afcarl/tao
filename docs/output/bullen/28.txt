Know how to be assertive but remain passive. Be receptive towards all situations and you will be in accordance with them, like a little child. Understanding the conditionality of opposites, you can avoid all opposition. Never in error, you are virtuous. People are bound to follow such and example. Know the personal, but keep to the impersonal: Accept the world as it is. If you accept the world as it is you will naturally be humble. How can the impersonal be arrogant? In this way the master is like a block of wood, which can be carved into any shape.
