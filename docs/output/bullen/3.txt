A great man who doesn't display his talent has no rivals. A wealthy man who doesn't flaunt his wealth sees no thieves. The master teaches the value of humility and the futility of ambition. He empties their minds of all they know and helps them extinguish desires. Those who think they know cannot understand him. Don't work at anything, and everything will work.
