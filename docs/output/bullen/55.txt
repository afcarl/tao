The master's virtue is to be like a newborn child. Its connection to the physical body is weak, but its hold on the Tao is strong. Therefore it is free from all physical dangers. It hasn't been conditioned, so its energy is whole. At one with nature, it can scream all day and never becomes hoarse. If you follow the natural flow there will be no desire. Without desire there is no expectation. Without expectation there is no disappointment. Without disappointment there is serenity. In serenity abides the true breath, which is the gateway to enlightenment.
