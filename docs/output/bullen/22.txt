Separate yourself and become whole. Yield and become firm. Be empty so you can be filled. Die so you can be reborn. Lose everything you have, and have it all. The master through the Tao sets and example for all. He doesn't show off so his depth is evident. Free from ambition, he can be trusted. Having lost his identity, people can identify with him. Never disagreeing, no one can disagree with him. When the ancient masters said: “Separate yourself and become whole”, they weren't doing so lightly. Trust the masters and become whole.
