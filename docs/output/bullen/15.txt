All past masters of the Tao had deep penetration of the subtle. This subtlety cannot be understood. Therefore the masters seem mysterious. All we can describe is their manner. They took care with every action, Watched like a hawk, Respected all, Adapted to every situation; and were firm inside so their clarity was always evident. Practice stilling the mind amidst everyday life, till it clears. Remain unmoved till the movement comes of its own accord.

Don't try to fulfill the Tao, but remain empty. Only by being empty can you be filled.
