One, who upon hearing of the Tao is immediately transformed, is superior. One, who upon hearing of the Tao, half doubts it, is average. One, who upon hearing of the Tao laughs at it, is inferior. If fools didn't scoff at it, it wouldn't be great. Thus it is said: Light seems to arise out of darkness. To go forward appears to be going in reverse. To be simple seems complicated. Real compassion seems harsh. Real strength seems weak. The unchanged seems to change. Great love seems indifferent. The master seems like a fool. The Tao is nothing, but through it everything is.
