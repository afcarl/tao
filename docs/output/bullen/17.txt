The master of the Tao is the highest. The next is the person who causes others to love him. The next is the person who causes others to fear him. The lowest is the person who causes others to despise him. The master trusts in the Tao, therefore doesn't try to improve others. Limited in his words, he lets his actions speak loudly. Others begin following his actions and success comes naturally.
