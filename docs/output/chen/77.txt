Isn't the Tao of Heaven like stretching a bow?
When it is high, it presses down,
when it is low, it lifts up.
When it is surplus, it reduces.
When it is deficient, it increases.
The Tao of Mankind is the opposite: it reduces the deficiency in order to add to the surplus.
Only the one who has the Tao offers his surplus to others.
Therefore the sage benefits others, yet claims no gratitude,
accomplishes his task, yet assumes no merit.
It is only because he does not want to be considered as a virtuous person.
