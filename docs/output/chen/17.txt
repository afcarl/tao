The best rulers are those whom the people barely know exist.
The next best are those whom the people love and praise.
Then there are those whom the people fear and despise.
If they do not rule the country with faith, the people will not respond to them with trust.
The best rulers do not need to rule the people with words.
If they have accomplished their task, the people will be ruled automatically.
