Weapons are cursed instruments.
They are something to hate.
Therefore he who holds the Tao will not use them.
A virtuous man keeps to the left position in his daily life, but values the right in times of war.
Weapons are cursed instruments and not made for virtuous men.
He who uses them against his will will handle them with great concern.
One should regard victory as something ugly.
He who regards it as beautiful enjoys killing and will not achieve his ambition under Heaven.
A lucky event is honoured by the left position,
an unlucky event by the right.
In preparation for war, a lieutenant stands on the left,
a general stands on the right.
This means that the matter is treated as a funeral.
Cry with sorrow when many people are killed.
Regard it as a period of mourning when the battle is won.
