Since ancient times, he who is versed in the Tao has been regarded as subtle, mysterious and obscurely discerning, too profound to be understood.
And because he is elusive, one is barely able to describe him.
Prudent as if fording a stream in winter.
Wary as if in fear of those around him.
Formal as if holding a memorial ceremony.
He lets his heart yield like melting ice.
He keeps his character rough like uncarved wood.
He makes his mind empty like a spacious valley.
He is opaque like muddy water.
There is one who remains still while the mud settles and the water clears itself.
There is one who remains quiet and finds that the moment of action arises of its own accord.
There is one who follows the Tao and does not seek plenitude simply because he is not fulfilled.
In that way he can be named and reach the Tao.
