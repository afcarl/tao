When people lack a sense of awe, then disaster will descend upon them.
Do not narrow the living space of the mind.
Do not reject the inherent character.
Because one does not reject, one will not be rejected.
That is why the sage knows himself but does not flaunt himself.
He loves himself but does not value himself.
Therefore he discards one and takes the other.
