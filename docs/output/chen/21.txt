A virtuous person comes into being only according to the Tao.
Tao is something which is obscure and indistinct.
Indistinct and obscure -
yet there is an appearance.
Obscure and indistinct -
yet there is a substance.
Vague and dim -
yet there is an essence within it.
This essence is genuine.
There is truth within it.
Since ancient times until now, its name never forsaken, it stands there to guard all the good deeds.
How do I know all the good deeds are guarded by this Tao?
I know.
