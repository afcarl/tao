The whole world says that the Tao is great, and that it seems without form.
It is great - that is why it has no form.
It has existed for a long time, and can also seem small.
I have three treasures that I keep and protect:
the first is goodheartedness,
the second is frugality,
the third is not daring to take the lead.
Only goodheartedness can bring courage.
Only frugality can bring generosity.
Not daring to take the lead can bring leadership.
Now to give up goodheartedness for courage, frugality for generosity, the rear for the lead,
will surely lead to the end.
Goodheartedness in battle will lead to victory,
and defence will strengthen the territory.
Heaven will save the one who follows this and guard him with goodheartedness.
