In the course of learning, one increases every day.
In the course of Tao, one decreases every day.
Decreasing and decreasing, until doing nothing.
Doing nothing, yet everything is done.
That is why he who aims at rulership should let things take their course.
Should he try to interfere, he is not worthy of aiming at rulership.
