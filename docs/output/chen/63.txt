Do that which takes no action.
Deal with that which engenders no effort.
Taste that which has no flavour.
Treat the small as the great.
Return enmity with virtue.
Plan the difficult as the easy.
Carry out the hard work as if it were the finer details.
The difficult things under Heaven come from the easy things.
Great matter is made up of minor matter.
Therefore the sage does not try to be great, and thus he can be great.
He who makes easy promises can be little trusted.
He who considers things to be easy will meet many difficulties.
That is why the sage expects difficulties, and therefore encounters none.
