The world had a beginning.
This beginning is the mother of the world.
Once you know the mother
you know the children.
When you know the children
you will return to embrace the mother.
Then you will live lifelong without danger.
Close the mouth, and the spirit will not escape.
Seal the ears, and the mind will not escape.
You will live lifelong without struggle.
Open the mouth, and take action for every matter, and you will live lifelong beyond hope.
To see the small is called clarity.
To know how to yield is called strength.
Use virtue outside the mind but return to virtue in the mind,
and you will live lifelong without danger.
This is what is called practising constancy.
