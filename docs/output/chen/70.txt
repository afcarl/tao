My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practise.
Yet no one in the world can understand them and put them into practice.
The words have a root.
The affairs have a sovereign.
Because people are ignorant, they do not understand me.
Those who understand me are few.
That is why I become valued.
This is why the sage does not flaunt himself but holds the treasure in his heart.
