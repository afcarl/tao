To rule the country with force is a matter that cannot be avoided - as I see.
Yet to hold the land under Heaven with force cannot be done.
Whoever does it will fail.
Whoever tries to control it will lose it.
If there is something that goes in the front, there will be something that follows behind.
If there is something that makes warmth, there will be something that cools it down.
If there is something that creates strength, there will be something that makes it weak.
If there is something that reaches its goal, there will be something that breaks it.
Therefore the sage stays away from opposing the rule of Nature,
from seeking luxuriousness, from doing what is against his own duty.
