He who knows how to travel does not leave any trace.
He who knows how to use words does not make any errors.
He who knows stratagems needs not any plans.
He who knows how to lock uses no bolts, yet what has been locked cannot be opened.
He who knows how to tie uses no rope, yet what has been tied cannot be released.
Therefore the sage always knows how to take care of people, and so no one is abandoned.
He knows how to take care of all things, and so no thing is abandoned.
This is what is called following discernment.
That is why good men are the teachers of bad men, and bad men are the sources of warning of good men.
Not to value the teacher, not to care for the sources,
this reveals foolishness, however clever one may be.
This is the essential secret.
