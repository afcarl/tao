Truthful words are not beautiful.
Beautiful words are not truthful.
Good men do not argue.
He who argues is not good.
He who knows, does not learn everything.
He who learns everything, does not know.
The sage does not hoard.
The more he does for others, the more he has.
The more he gives to others, the greater his abundance.
The Tao of Heaven gives benefit but no harm.
The Tao of the sage accomplishes good deeds but makes no claims.
