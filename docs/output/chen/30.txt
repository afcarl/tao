The ruler who rules his people with Tao
need not show his force with an army.
If he who rules does so with the force of an army the others will return with the force of an army.
Wherever armies have marched,
thistles and thorns grow.
Whenever a great war has begun,
crop failure and famine follow.
That is why a good ruler would not dare to flaunt the power of his army.
He would not use the force to glory in the force.
He uses the army, yet with reserve and dignity.
He uses the army, yet with politeness.
He uses the army just because he is forced to do so.
That is what 'to show consideration and not force' means.
A strong army is like a creature in its prime:
it will only grow older.
This is the rule of Tao and that is the reason why one should not oppose the Tao.
He who opposes the Tao will meet an early end.
