If people are not afraid of death,
why threaten them with death to prevent them from committing a crime?
When people are afraid of death,
there are still those who are not afraid of it,
who will dare to commit a crime, and so why arrest and execute them?
There is an official executioner who is in charge of execution.
To kill on behalf of the executioner is like carving wood on behalf of the carpenter.
Those who cut wood on behalf of the carpenter can seldom escape from hurting their own hand.
