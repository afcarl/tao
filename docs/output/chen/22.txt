The tortured will seek for the snug.
The bent will seek for the straight.
The hollow will seek for the full.
The worn will seek for the new.
The minor will seek for the major.
The affluent will seek for the perplexed.
Therefore the virtuous man considers unity as the only model for the world.
He does not flaunt himself, therefore he is brilliant.
He does not consider himself right, therefore he is incontestable.
He does not require his fame, therefore he is meritorious.
He does not stick to his own knowledge, therefore he grows.
Only because he does not fight can no one under Heaven fight with him.
The ancient saying 'The tortured will be made snug' is very well put.
It truly enables one to preserve the unity.
