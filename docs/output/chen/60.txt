Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish.
It is spoiled by too much interference.
When the ruler presents his country with Tao, Heaven will not harm him.
Not only will the curse not fall upon him, but it will not even cause harm to the people.
As the curse will not hurt the people, neither will the sage cause harm to the people.
Only because they do not hurt one another, will they blend their virtue.
