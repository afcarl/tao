A small country with a limited population ensures that even though the people may have many valuables, they do not need to use them.
The ruler lets the people consider death as a serious matter,
so that they will not wish to leave their homes.
Though they have ships and carriages, they will not use them;
and though they have soldiers and arms, there is no need to deploy them.
The ruler lets the people return to the time of knotting ropes to record information.
They will find pleasure in their tasteless food.
They will find beauty in their simple clothes.
They will find peace in their small houses.
They will enjoy their own customs.
They can see the neighbouring country.
They can even hear the sounds of each other's roosters and dogs.
They will grow old and die, but remain content never to go to the neighbouring country.
