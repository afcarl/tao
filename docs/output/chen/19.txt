Eliminate the virtuous man, discard the wise, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Eliminate the goodhearted, discard justice, and the people will fulfil their filial duty with kindness.
Eliminate skilled workmen, discard profit, and the thief will not appear.
These three exist only as superficial forms.
Therefore this is the teaching to the people:
Embrace the simple,
hold the unadorned,
remove selfishness,
reduce desire.
