The Tao is the mystery of the myriad creatures.
It is the treasure of good men.
It is the protection of bad men.
Beautiful words of Tao can reach a high rank.
Respectful deeds of Tao can raise a man above others.
Even if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?
That is why when the emperor takes office and the three ducal ministers are appointed, although gifts such as the ceremonial jade and the carriage and horses are usually given, it is better to offer the Tao.
And the Tao has been valued since ancient times,
so why shouldn't the emperor seek for it every day?
If he can follow this Tao, all sins will be absolved.
That is why the most valuable thing under Heaven is Tao.
