Rivers and seas can be king of the hundred valleys,
only because they accept their lower position.
Therefore they can be king of the hundred valleys.
That is why the sage
who wishes to rule the people
must stay beneath them,
who wishes to lead the people
must follow behind them.
In this way the sage stays above the people,
yet does not oppress them.
He stays ahead of the people,
yet does not exhaust them.
Then the people will support him with joy and never tire of following him.
And because he does not fight, no one can fight against him.
