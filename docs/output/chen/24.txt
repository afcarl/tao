He who tiptoes cannot stand.
He who strides cannot walk.
He who sees only himself is not enlightened.
He who is self-righteous is not notable.
He who boasts about himself will have no merit.
He who praises himself will have no improvement.
The way he takes the Tao, as if eating with a full stomach and moving with excess baggage, will be disliked.
Therefore he who follows the Tao will not abide this.
