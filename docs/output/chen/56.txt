One who knows does not speak.
One who speaks does not know.
He closes his mouth, seals his ears.
He subdues his sharpness, releases his worries.
He blends himself with the light, he becomes one with the dust.
This is what is called mysterious identity.
Therefore he regards things out of his reach as dear.
He regards things out of his reach as distant,
he perceives unreachable things with harm,
he perceives unreachable things with value,
he perceives unreachable things with humbleness.
That is why he values everything under Heaven.
