Can one hold the soul in the body, hold the mind in the spirit, and keep them as one?
Can one concentrate the energy of life and keep it supple like a newborn child?
Can one study everything and really know everything without making a mistake?
Can one govern the nation with all the right actions and really love the people?
Can one always make a decision with the right mind?
Can one empty the mind and fill it with the brightness of wisdom and learn to step back from this knowledge?
Can one give life and grow life and yet claim no possession?
Can one supervise and benefit others, yet exercise no authority and rely on no pride?
This is what is called the mysterious virtue.
