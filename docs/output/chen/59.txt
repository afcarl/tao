The best way to rule the people and serve Heaven is to be frugal.
To be frugal means to return to the beginning of creation.
To know the beginning of creation means to accumulate virtue.
Accumulating virtue means to overcome everything.
To overcome everything means to reach the limit.
By reaching the limit, one can possess a kingdom.
When one has possessed the mother of the kingdom,
the kingdom will then live long.
This is called the deep-rooted foundation.
This is the way to long life.
