Should I know just a fraction of Tao,
I would walk on the great way, fearing to impose upon the people.
The main road is smooth to walk but the people prefer the smaller footpath.
That is why the court is corrupt,
the fields lie in waste, the granaries are empty.
Yet the rulers wear clothes adorned with finery,
carry sharp swords decorated with patterns,
possess storehouses overflowing with goods and wealth.
This is to rule by stealing.
This is not the Tao.
