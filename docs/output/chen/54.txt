He who is well established cannot be uprooted.
He who is holding tight cannot slip away.
His descendants will never cease to honour him.
He who cultivates the moral character, his virtue will be clear.
He who cultivates his own family, his virtue will flourish.
He who cultivates the village, his virtue will endure.
He who cultivates the country, his virtue will be abundant.
He who cultivates the land, his virtue will be widespread.
Therefore look at others as at your own person.
Look at other families as at your own family.
Look at other villages as at your own village.
Look at other countries as at your own country.
Look at other lands as at your own land.
How do I know it is like this under Heaven?
By means of this.
