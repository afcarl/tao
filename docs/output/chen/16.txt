Do one's best to achieve emptiness.
Hold firmly to stillness.
All things on earth follow the same cycle.
I observe their return.
All the teeming creatures return to their roots.
Returning to the root is called stillness.
Stillness means to return to life.
A return to life means constancy.
Understanding constancy means enlightenment.
Not knowing constancy leads to evil deeds.
Knowing constancy is knowing tolerance.
Tolerance is impartiality.
Impartiality is the skilful exercise of kingship.
Kingship is Heaven.
Heaven is Tao.
Tao is eternity.
Until the end of one's own life, one will meet no danger.
