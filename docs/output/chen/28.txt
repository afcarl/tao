Recognize the male - the yang,
guard the female - the yin.
Be a valley under Heaven.
Be a valley under Heaven and the constant virtue will not fade away.
One will become like a little child again.
Recognize the white - the yang,
guard the black - the yin.
Be a model under Heaven.
Be a model under Heaven and the constant virtue will not fade away.
One will return to the infinite.
Recognize the glory, guard the disgrace.
Be a valley under Heaven.
Be the valley under Heaven and return again to the uncarved block.
When the block is carved up it is transformed into useful wares.
The sage will use them with equal heart.
Therefore the great law will not crumble.
