It is easy to control a situation when it is tranquil.
It is easy to deal with a matter before the omen is cast.
It is easy to break something when it is fragile.
It is easy to scatter something when it is minute.
Deal with things before they arise.
Govern a situation before it descends into disorder.
A huge tree as great as a man's arm-span grows from a tiny seed.
A nine-storey terrace rises from a pile of earth.
A thousand-mile journey starts from a single footstep.
He who acts to reach something will lead to its decline.
He who tries hard to hold on to something will lose it.
That is why the sage does nothing, and leads nothing to decline.
He does not hold on to anything, therefore he does not lose anything.
People often lead their actions to the verge of success, then fail.
Be careful to treat the end with equal care as the beginning.
Then you will not fail.
Therefore the sage desires not to desire, not to value precious goods,
to learn how not to learn, to cover the mistakes of the multitude,
to assist the myriad creatures according to the law of Nature.
Yet he dares not act.
