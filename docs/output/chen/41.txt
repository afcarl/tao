A first-rate scholar hears the Tao and practises it conscientiously.
A second-rate scholar hears the Tao and follows it just at that moment.
A poor scholar hears the Tao and laughs out loud.
If the poor scholar does not laugh, it cannot be the Tao.
That is why it is said:
One who knows the Tao clearly seems ignorant.
One who improves himself according to the Tao seems backward.
One who moves with the Tao is equal to the Tao.
The highest virtue feels empty, like the valley.
The purest whiteness feels tainted.
The brightest virtue never seems adequate.
He who is virtuous feels like a thief.
The purest nature seems polluted.
The truest square has no corners.
The greatest abilities mature slowly.
The greatest tone has no sound.
The greatest shape has no form.
The Tao hides within the nameless.
Only the Tao is able to change and to bring everything to completion.
