Heaven and Earth treat all creatures as they treat a straw dog:
with great kindness.
The sage treats the people as he treats a straw dog:
with great kindness.
Between Heaven and Earth there is a big void;
it is like a bag without a seam,
it is like the hole in a bamboo flute.
This void cannot be overpowered:
the more it moves, the more it yields.
Many words lead to less understanding, therefore it is best to guard the void.
