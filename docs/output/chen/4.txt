The Tao is based on harmony between emptiness and abundance.
It is the deep source of the myriad creatures.
It softens their sharpness.
It releases their confusion.
It lessens their lustre.
It merges with their dust.
The Tao is so clear and so transparent that it is nearly invisible, nearly formless;
no one can know its origin,
for it came before all creation.
