Since ancient times, what comes into possession is the 'One'.
Heaven in possession of the 'One' is clear.
The Earth in possession of the 'One' is tranquil.
The gods in possession of the 'One' are efficacious.
The valley in possession of the 'One' is full.
The myriad creatures in possession of the 'One' are alive.
The rulers in possession of the 'One' are faithful to their country.
Although they are different, they are the same 'One'.
When Heaven is not clear, it risks cracking.
When the Earth is not tranquil, it risks exploding.
When the gods are not efficacious, they risk ceasing to exist.
When the valley is not full, it risks drying up.
When the myriad creatures possess no life, they risk extinction.
When rulers are not faithful, they risk a fall from their heights.
Therefore the humble is the basis of the precious.
The low is the basis of the high.
The rulers shall humiliate themselves.
That is why one grows the root at the base - isn't it?
That is why one prefers to be the wheel instead of the carriage,
one chooses to be a stone instead of jade.
