The perfect warrior does not flaunt his bravery.
The perfect fighter does not get angry.
The perfect winner does not reveal his tactics.
The perfect employer is humble before his employees.
This is called the virtue of non-fighting.
This is called the ability to manage others.
This is called uniting with the law of Heaven.
Since ancient times, it has been the highest goal.
