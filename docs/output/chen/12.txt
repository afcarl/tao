The five colours blind man's eye.
The five tones deafen man's ears.
The five flavours dull man's taste.
Riding and hunting drive man's mind mad.
Precious goods alter man's behaviour.
Therefore the sage tries to fill the belly (the virtuous character) and not the eyes (the gateway to the emotions).
And so he discards one and keeps the other.
