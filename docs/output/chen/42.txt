The Tao bears the 'One'.
The 'One' bears the 'Two'.
The 'Two' bears the 'Three'.
The 'Three' bears the myriad creatures.
The myriad creatures carry yin and embrace yang, which both melt into 'chi' - the energy of life - to achieve harmony.

He who is a ferocious adversary does nothing else but cause his own death.
With these words I will maintain my teaching.
