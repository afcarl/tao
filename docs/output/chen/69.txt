There is a saying among military strategists:
'I dare not act as the host, but the guest.
I dare advance an inch, but retreat a foot.'
This is called conducting in non-conducting.
Pulling back without using force.
Facing the fight without engaging the enemy.
Holding no weapons.
The greatest danger is to undervalue the enemy.
To undervalue the enemy will cause loss of the three treasures.
That is why when two forces fight against each other, the one that is full of sorrow will win.
