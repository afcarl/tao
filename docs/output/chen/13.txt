Accept favour and disgrace as a threat that troubles the body like a disease.
What does it mean to accept favour and disgrace as a threat?
Everyone seeks to be favoured.
No one seeks to be disgraced.
When one receives it, it causes alarm.
When one loses it, it causes alarm.
Therefore favour and disgrace are both threatening.
What does it mean that the disease troubles one's body?
One suffers from the disease because one treasures one's body.
If one does not love one's body, one will no longer suffer from the disease.
Therefore
entrust the land under Heaven to the one who does not treasure his body,
sanction the land under Heaven to the one who does not love his body.
He who does not love even his own body will not treasure rulership, and so he will truly care for all things.
