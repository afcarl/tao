There is nothing under Heaven softer and weaker than water,
yet to attack the hard and the strong nothing can surpass it, nothing can take its place.
That is why the soft overcomes the hard, the weak surpasses the strong.
Everyone knows this, yet no one is able to practise it.
Therefore the sage says:
He who can take upon himself the humiliation and insults inflicted on the country is called the king of a state.
He who can take upon himself the bad luck suffered by the country is called the emperor of the land under Heaven.
Straightforward words often seem contrary.
