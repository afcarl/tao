When a large country is like water,
which runs towards lower places,
all the other countries will unite with it.
In the unity of the world, the female always overcomes the male with stillness.
The stillness is akin to the lower position - that is how a large country can be respected by a small country and conquer it.
And if a small country takes the lower position and allows itself to be influenced by the large country, the small can conquer the large.
That is why by being lower to take, or lower to be taken,
a large country only tries to annex a small one and a small country only tries to protect its people.
They both find what they want.
Therefore it is fitting for a large country to be the lower one.
