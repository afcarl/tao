The Tao has no name, like an uncarved block.
But no one under Heaven dares claim its allegiance.
Should lords and princes be able to hold fast to it,
the myriad creatures will submit to their own accord.
Heaven and Earth will unite and the sweet dewdrop will fall.
People will live in peace, even though no one is seeking for it.
When the block is carved it will be named.
It will also be time to stop.
Knowing to stop in time avoids danger.
The Tao runs under Heaven as the river and the water of the valley run into the sea.
