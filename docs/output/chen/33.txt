He who knows others is resourceful; he who knows himself is enlightened.
He who surpasses others has power; he who surpasses himself is strong.
He who is content is rich.
He who keeps going has will.
He who maintains his own position will last long.
He who dies, yet whose natural character remains, will live a long life.
