The Tao is floating everywhere, to the left and to the right.
The lives of the myriad creatures depend on it, no one can live without it.
It accomplishes its task, yet claims no honour.
It nourishes the myriad creatures, yet claims no possession.
It is always free from desire;
it can be called small.
The myriad creatures turn to it, yet it does not master them; it can be called great.
That is why the sage never boasts to be the great one, therefore he is the great one.
