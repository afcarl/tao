The Tao creates.
The virtue nourishes.
The things form.
The environment shapes them to completion.
That is why the myriad creatures all respect the Tao, and value virtue.
When the Tao is respected, virtue is valued.
No one can command them but the Tao.
That is why the Tao creates myriad creatures.
Virtue nourishes them, cultivates them, educates them, completes them, ripens them, supports them, carries them.
The Tao creates them without possessing them, benefits them without profiting from them, guides them without commanding them.
That is what profound virtue means.
