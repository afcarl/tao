The greatest good is like water: it benefits all life without being noticed.
It flows even to the lowliest places where no one chooses to be and so it is very close to the Tao.
It settles only in quiet locations.
Its deepest heart is always clear.
It offers itself with great goodness.
It keeps its rhythm as it keeps its promises.
It governs tributaries as it governs its people.
It adapts to all necessities.
It moves at the right moment.
It never flaunts its goodness and so it never attracts any blame.
