One who renounces learning has no sorrow.
Between the 'yea' and the 'nay', is there much difference?
Between the good and the bad, is there great distance?
Should one fear what other people fear?
If one does not cultivate one's virtue, it is like letting the land lie waste.
Everyone seeks the things that taste good, the joy in life.
I alone am detached and expressionless, like a newborn baby that has not yet learned knowledge or worry.
Everyone wishes for more than they need but I seek to avoid it.
I have the mind of a fool, but pure.
Everyone shows their intelligence; I show only stupidity.
Everyone tries to find profit with sharpness; I alone do not find it.
Others' desire has no end; like the sea, they drift without reaching a goal.
Everyone thinks that they are someone; I only think of myself as no one.
I behave differently to all the others, and only treasure being nourished by the mother of all creatures.
