The sage has no mind of his own.
He takes the minds of the people as his own.
Whatever others like, he likes too.
Whatever others dislike, he likes too.
This is what is meant by virtuous goodness.
Whatever others trust, he trusts too.
Whatever others mistrust, he trusts too.
This is what is meant by virtuous trust.
The sage leads his life with vigilance.
He merges his mind with all others' under Heaven.
People are used to hearing and seeing the behaviour of the sage and so they are influenced, and become pure again, as a newborn child.
