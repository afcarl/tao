Emotions and longings are life.
Passions and desires are death.
There are thirteen kinds of life:
seven are emotions and they refer to the gates of the mind;
six are longings and they refer to the gates of the body.
There are also thirteen kinds of death:
seven are passions and they refer to the gates of the mind;
six are desires and they refer to the gates of the body.
These thirteen kinds of life and death rule also human beings, because one treasures life.
He who is good at conserving his life will not meet the rhinoceros and the tiger on his journey.
He can enter a battle without being hurt.
The rhinoceros cannot attack him with its horn,
the tiger cannot scratch him with its claws,
troops cannot use their swords against him.
That is only because he has no place for death to enter.
