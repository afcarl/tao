He who cherishes deep virtue is comparable to a newborn baby.
Poisonous insects will not sting him.
Ferocious animals will not pounce upon him.
Predatory birds will not swoop down upon him.
His bones are weak and his muscles are soft.
He does not know of the union between male and female.
He has the highest spirit.
He can cry all day but never become hoarse.
He has perfect harmony.
He knows harmony as constancy.
He knows constancy as clarity.
To nourish the body with abundant food and clothing means to borrow the outer energy.
To command the 'chi' with the mind means to use force.
When reaching their prime, creatures begin to age.
He who tries to oppose this rule means to go against the Tao.
