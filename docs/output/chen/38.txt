A man of great virtue is not aware of virtue; that is the reason why he has virtue.
A man of little virtue does not miss virtue; that is the reason why he has no virtue.
The great virtue is when one does not do anything, yet everything is done.
The little virtue is when one does everything, yet something remains undone.
A man of great humanity acts, yet he acts without purpose.
A man of great justice acts, yet he acts with purpose.
A man of great courtesy acts, and if no one responds he rolls up his sleeves and tries to persuade them to respond.
That is why when the Tao is lost, virtue appears.
When virtue is lost, humanity appears.
When humanity is lost, justice appears.
When justice is lost, courtesy appears.
Courtesy is the superficial form of faith and trust; it is the beginning of disorder.
A man of much knowledge results in the flourishing of the Tao; it is the beginning of foolishness.
Therefore a true man lives with magnanimity, renounces the frivolous, lives with simplicity, renounces the luxuriant.
That is why he chooses the one and renounces the other.
