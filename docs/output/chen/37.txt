The Tao always does nothing but nothing remains undone.
If the ruler observes this the myriad creatures will act of their own accord.
After their metamorphosis, desire will arise.
It will press them down with the power of the uncarved block, the Tao.
The nameless uncarved block is free from desire.
Absence of desire will lead to stillness and the world under Heaven will be harmonized by itself.
