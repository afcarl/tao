Nature speaks rarely.
A stormy wind cannot blow for the whole morning, a passing heavy shower cannot fall for the whole day.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot show their sudden power for ever - much less can men.
That is the reason why one who follows the Tao
accords the Tao with the Tao,
accords the virtue with the virtue,
accords the loss with the loss.
He who accords with the Tao is gladly accepted by the Tao.
He who accords with the virtue is gladly accepted by the virtue.
He who accords with the loss is gladly accepted by the loss.
When there isn't enough faith from he who leads the people, the people who follow him will not have good faith.
