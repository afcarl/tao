Fame or your self: which is dearer?
Your self or your possessions: which is more precious?
To have or to lose: which is more detrimental?
That is why the most beloved will cost a great deal.
The more one stores, the more one will lose.
He who is content will not meet disgrace.
He who knows when to stop will not face danger.
Only then is there longevity.
