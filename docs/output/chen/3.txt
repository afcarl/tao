Not to value one's own virtues is the way to restrain people from striving for wealth.
Not to value the precious is the way to restrain people from theft.
Not to see the desirable is the way to restrain confusion in the mind.
Therefore the wise way to rule is:
not to give importance to oneself,
or try to enrich one's spirit and virtue;
not to be inordinately proud of one's ability,
or try to make unceasing efforts to improve oneself.
Let the people stay free from desire and knowledge in order to avoid the pitfalls that knowledge may bring.
Rule by doing nothing, then everything will be as it should.
