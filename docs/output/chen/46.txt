When there is Tao under Heaven, fleet-footed horses are working in the fields.
When there is no Tao under Heaven, war horses appear outside the city.
There is no greater crime than having wrong desires.
There is no greater hardship than being discontent.
There is no greater misfortune than obtaining one's own triumph.
That is why he who feels content is always content.
