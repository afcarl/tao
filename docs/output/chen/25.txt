There is matter formed of confusion, born earlier than Heaven and Earth.
In the silence and the void it stands alone and does not change.
It turns around without worry.
It is capable of being the mother of all creatures under Heaven.
I do not know its name, but call it Tao.
It is compelled to be named 'great'.
'Great' means passing away,
passing away means far away,
far away means returning.
That is why the Tao is great.
Heaven is great.
Earth is great.
The emperor is great.
Within the realm there are four great things; the emperor is one of the four.
Human beings follow the Earth.
The Earth follows Heaven.
Heaven follows the Tao.
The Tao follows Nature.
