When peace is made between two great rivals,
some resentment will surely remain.
How can this be considered a good deed?
That is why the sage keeps his half of the agreement,
but does not require the debt from the other party.
That is how a man with virtue takes charge of the agreement.
But a man without virtue requires the other to fulfil his obligation,
like a wheel running in a rut.
The Tao of Heaven shows no favouritism: it is always on the side of good men.
