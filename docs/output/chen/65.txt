In ancient times, those who knew well how to serve the Tao did not use it to enlighten the people but to fool them.
People are difficult to govern only because they are intelligent and resourceful.
Therefore to rule with intelligence harms the country.
To govern the country without intelligence is a blessing for the nation.
He who knows the difference, knows the principle.
To know the principle is called mysterious virtue.
Mysterious virtue is deep and far.
It might at first seem to go against the natural order but it will then lead to harmony.
