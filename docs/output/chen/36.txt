To weaken things, one must first strengthen them.
To abolish things, one must first prevail upon them.
To seize things, one must first grant them.

The soft will overcome the hard.
The weak will overcome the strong.
The fish shall not leave deep waters.
The weapons of a country should not be displayed in public.
