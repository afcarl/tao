Embrace the appearance of Tao.
Everyone under the great Heaven will follow it,
yet no one tries to cause harm to it.
Peace and safety and equality will arise.
Banquets and delicacies are like passing guests: they cannot last.
The Tao passes the mouth, it cannot be tasted.
The Tao passes the eyes, it cannot be seen.
The Tao passes the ears, it cannot be heard.
Yet it can never be exhausted by use.
