Many consider my teaching to be nonsense.
But the profound is a lot like nonsense.
If a teaching does not seem nonsensical, then it must be trivial.
I have three treasures to guard and preserve:
The first is compassion.
The second is self–restraint.
The third is not wanting to be ahead of others.
Compassion breeds fortitude.
Self–restraint breeds generosity.
Not wanting to be ahead of others breeds leadership.
These days, people want courage without compassion,
generosity without self–restraint, and
leadership without the willingness to be led.
This is death.
Compassion rules!
On the attack, it wins.
On the defense, it holds the fort.
It is Heaven's means of aid and protection.
