My teachings are very easy to understand
and even easier to put into practice.
And yet, no one understands or practices them.
My teachings are derived from an ancient system of principles.
People who do not realize this do not really know me.
Few know me, but that is my value.
Therefore, the Taoâ€“Master wears rough clothing,
but has a jewel for a heart.
