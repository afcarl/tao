There is a saying among military strategists:
"Instead of advancing, I'll be advanced upon;
it is better to retreat a foot than to advance an inch."
This is known as advancing without advancing,
getting ready without showing your muscles,
capturing without attacking,
being well–armed without weapons.
There is nothing worse than underestimating your enemy.
That leads to total defeat.
Therefore, when armies clash,
it is the side that does not rejoice in war–making that wins.
