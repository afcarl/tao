The Tao cannot be named or defined.
It is invisible, but it contains all things.
If rulers could master it, then everything would fall into place.
Heaven and Earth would be united.
A sweet rain would fall.
People would be just without regulation.
However, when people seek to rule, they divide the whole
and begin assigning names to things.
And now, there are names upon names. Too many!
The naming must stop.
Knowing when to stop saves us from danger.
Tao in the world is like rivers flowing into the sea.
