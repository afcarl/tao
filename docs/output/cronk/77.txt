The Tao is like the bending of a bow.
The top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up.
If the cord is too long, it is shortened;
if it is too short, it is lengthened.
The policy of the Tao is to take from those who have too much
and give to those who have too little.
But that is not the human practice.
We take from those who have too little
and give to those who have too much.
Who is it that has more than enough
and gives his surplus to those in need?
Only the follower of the Tao.
The follower of the Tao acts without hope of gain,
accomplishes but takes no credit,
does not wish to lord it over others.
