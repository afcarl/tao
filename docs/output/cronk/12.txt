The five colors can make us blind.
The five sounds can make us deaf.
The five flavors can deaden our taste.
Racing, chasing, and hunting can drive us mad.
The pursuit of treasure knocks us off the path.
Therefore, the Taoâ€“Master follows his inner vision
rather than his outer vision.
He chooses this but not that.
