No beauty without ugliness.
No good without evil.
Being and non–being are two aspects of the same reality.
Difficult and easy, long and short, high and low, before and after:
With each pair, two sides of the same coin..
Therefore, the Tao–Master acts with non–ado [wu–wei]
and teaches without speaking.
Things come and go. He lets them come and go.
He creates, but he does not own.
He achieves, but he takes no credit.
He completes his work and then forgets about it.
Practice non–ado, and your accomplishments endure.
