Much talk is contrary to nature.
The wind doesn't blow all morning.
The rain doesn't fall all day.
Wind and rain are caused by nature,
If nature restrains herself, shouldn't people do the same?
He who follows the Tao is one with the Tao.
He who is virtuous is one with Virtue [Te].
He who loses the Tao becomes a loss.
Surrender to the Tao, and it will be your home.
Practice virtue [Te], and it will be your abode.
Lose the Tao, and you will then reside in loss.
No trust given, no trust received.
