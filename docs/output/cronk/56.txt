Those who know do not tell. Those who tell do not know.
Stop talking, withdraw from the ratâ€“race, calm your spirit,
untangle yourself, soften your glare.
Be one with the dust of the earth.
This is primal union.
Achieving union with the Tao places one beyond
attraction and repulsion, benefit and harm, honor and disgrace.
This is the highest state of being.
