It is good to be like water.
It nourishes without effort.
It flows without contention into low places that people scorn.
Thus, it is like the Tao.
In dwelling, live close to the land.
In thinking, go deep.
In relating to others, be gentle.
In governing, seek good order and justice.
In acting, be skillful.
In working, do all things at the right time.
No contention, no strife.
