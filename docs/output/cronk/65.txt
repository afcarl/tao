The ancient rulers who followed the Tao
did not try to enlighten the people,
but rather aimed at making them dull.
People are hard to govern because they are so clever.
Rulers who seek to enlighten the people
are like bandits who prey upon the land.
Rulers who forget about enlightening the people
are a real blessing to the nation.
Remember these two enduring principles:
they represent the power [Te] of the Tao.
Te goes deep and far.
All things turn back and reach original harmony.
