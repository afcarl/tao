How to govern in accordance with the Tao:
No conquest by force of arms.
Weapons always turn back against themselves.
Encamp an army today;
the campground is all thorns and brambles tomorrow.
Make war for a month; there will be famine for years.
Do what needs to be done, but do not rejoice in victory.
Make war, if necessary, and win,
but without arrogance, without hostility, without pride,
without needless violence.
War, victory, and the rest do not last.
They are contrary to Tao.
What is contrary to Tao perishes quickly.
