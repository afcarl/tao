Do you think you can control the world? I don't think so.
The world belongs to the Tao. It can't be controlled.
If you mess with it, you'll ruin it.
If you try to grab it, you'll lose it.
Some things move on; others remain behind;
some things are hot; others are cold;
some things are strong; others are weak;
some things are up; others are down.
The Taoâ€“Master renounces extremes, excess, and extravagance.
