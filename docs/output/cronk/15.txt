The Taoâ€“Masters of old had profound wisdom and deep understanding.
They were unfathomable.
We cannot comprehend them; all we can do is describe them:
Cautious, like someone crossing an icy stream;
Alert, like someone sensing danger;
Courteous, like a houseguest;
Yielding, like melting ice;
Undefined, like a piece of uncarved wood;
Open, like a valley;
Murky, like muddy water.
We must wait for the water to settle; then it will be clear.
Can you keep still until what is needed becomes clear?
Those who follow the Tao are not full of themselves.
They are like durable garments that need no renewal.
