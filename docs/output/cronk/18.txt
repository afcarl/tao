When the Tao is not followed, kindness and morality appear.
When intelligence and learning are exalted,
pretentiousness emerges.
When there is no peace and order in the family,
then we get all kinds of talk about "family values."
When the country is badly governed and in chaos,
we then glorify patriotism.
