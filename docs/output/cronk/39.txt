In archaic times, by attaining the One,
Heaven became clear;
Earth became stable;
spirit became transcendent;
valleys became full;
the ten thousand things became alive;
rulers made the country ordered and secure.
This implies that
If Heaven lacked clarity, it would be divided;
If the Earth lacked stability, it would be shaky;
If spirit lacked transcendence, it would be used up;
If valleys lacked fullness, they would be depleted;
If the ten thousand things lacked life, they would fade away;
and if rulers lacked nobility, they would fall,
and the country would be collapse into chaos.
Therefore, the humble is be root of the noble;
the lowly is the foundation of the high;
rulers call themselves "orphans," "widows," and "worthless."
This is taking the humble and the lowly as the root and foundation,
is it not?
You can have all the parts of a chariot without having a chariot.
Better to rumble like rocks than to tinkle like jade.
