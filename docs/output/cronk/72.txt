When the people do not fear your power,
then your power has become truly great.
Do not intrude into their homes.
Do not interfere with their work.
If you do not oppress them, then they will not become sick of you.
Thus, the Taoâ€“Master knows himself, but does not show himself.
He loves himself, but is not arrogant.
Therefore, he lets go of that and chooses this.
