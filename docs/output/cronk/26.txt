Heavy is the foundation of light.
Stillness is the source of movement.
Thus, the Tao–Master travels all day
without losing sight of the baggage–cart.
He is not swept away by splendid scenery.
He remains quiet and unperturbed.
Why should the lord of the land allow himself to be swept away?
Allow yourself to be swept away, and you lose your foundation.
Allow yourself to be moved, and you lose self–mastery.
