Weapons generate fear; all creatures hate them.
Therefore, the Taoâ€“Master tries not to use them . . . .
He uses them only when there is no alternative,
and then without joy, in a calm and restrained way.
Enjoy weapons, enjoy killing.
Enjoy killing, lose yourself . . . .
The killing of many people should create sorrow and grief.
A great victory is a funeral ceremony.
