In governing, employ no surprises.
In waging war, employ only surprises.
Win the world with non–ado.
How do I know this? Like this!
The more rules and regulations there are,
the poorer the people become.
The more experts there are, the more confusion there is.
The more skillful and clever technicians there are,
the more horrifying inventions are produced.
The more "law and order" there is, the higher the crime–rate.
Therefore, the Tao–Master says,
I do nothing, and the people govern themselves.
I practice keeping quiet, and the people find justice.
I seek emptiness, and the people prosper.
I have no desires, and the people return
to a natural and simple life.
