Discard learning and knowledge,
and the people will be a hundred times happier.
Banish kindness and morality,
and the people will rediscover love and duty.
Forget about industry and profit,
and there won't be any thieves.
When these three things are done, more will be required:
Look at plain silk; hold uncarved wood;
let self dwindle; let desire fade.
