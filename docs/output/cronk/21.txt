Te flows from Tao.
Tao is elusive and evasive.
Evasive and elusive, yet within it there are ideas.
Elusive and evasive, yet within it are entities.
Dark and obscure, yet within it there is life.
The life of the Tao is so real; it gives rise to certainty.
From the beginning until now, it has appeared in countless forms, it has been given countless names.
