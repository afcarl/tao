The world's Source, the Mother of all things.
Knowing the Mother, we know her children.
Knowing the children, but holding on to the Mother,
we are free from the fear of death.
Stop talking, withdraw from the rat–race, and life is full.
Blab on, lose yourself in busy–ness, and life is lost.
Seeing the small requires good vision.
Yielding is strength.
Turn to the Inner Light, and find the eternal.
