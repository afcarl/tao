Following the Tao, the Tao–Master leaves no tracks,
speaks without error, counts without markers.
No locks on his door, and yet no one can open it.
No rope used, and yet his knots cannot be untied.
Thus, the Tao–Master cares for all beings and neglects none.
Thus, he follows the light.
The Tao–Master teaches the fool; and thus the fool learns.
But teaching and learning will not take place
unless the student values the teacher
and the teacher loves the student.
This is the subtle secret of teaching and learning.
