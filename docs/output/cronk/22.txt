To be whole, let yourself break.
To be straight, let yourself bend.
To be full, let yourself be empty.
To be new, let yourself wear out.
To have everything, give everything up.
The Taoâ€“Master clings to the Tao and becomes a model for all.
He doesn't put on a show, but his light shines forth.
He doesn't justify himself, but he is known for his integrity.
He doesn't boast, but he is recognized as accomplished.
He doesn't contend with others, and thus no one contends with him.
The old saying, "Surrender and conquer," is not an empty slogan.
Surrender to the Tao and find yourself completed.
