When the government is restrained,
the people are happy and satisfied.
When the government meddles in everything,
the people are disgruntled and miserable.
Happiness eclipses misery.
Misery eclipses happiness.
Which will it be?
The straight becomes crooked.
Good becomes evil.
The people remain bewildered.
Thus, the Taoâ€“Master is sharp but not cutting, incisive but not biting,
straight but not controlling, bright but not glaring.
