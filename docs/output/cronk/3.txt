Glorify the superior, hatch jealousy and competition.
Value possessions, provoke stealing.
Stimulate desire, enflame the passions.
Therefore, the Tao–Master would rule
by emptying minds and filling bellies,
by weakening desire and strengthening bodies.
He would lead the people away from knowing and wanting
and would try to prevent those with knowledge
from interfering.
Practice non–ado, and everything will fall into place.
