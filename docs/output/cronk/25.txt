Before the birth of Heaven and Earth,
there was something without form but complete.
Silent. Empty. Independent. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternal.
It is the Mother of all things.
I cannot classify it, but I call it Tao.
Powerful, it creates all things, is present in all things, returns all things to their origin.
The Tao is great. Heaven is great.
Earth is great. Humanity is great.
These are the four great things.
Humanity follows Earth. Earth follows Heaven.
Heaven follows Tao. Tao follows its own nature.
