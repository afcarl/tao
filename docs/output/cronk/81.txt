True words aren't pretty; pretty words aren't true.
The good do not contend; those who contend aren't good.
The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.
The Tao–Master is not greedy.
The more he does for others, the more he has.
The more he gives to others, the richer he becomes.
The Tao sharpens without cutting.
The Tao–Master acts with non–ado.
