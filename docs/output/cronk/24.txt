He who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm.
He who walks fast cannot walk far.
He who shows off does not shine forth.
He who pushes will not succeed.
He who boasts will not achieve.
He who praises his own work creates nothing that endures.
These things inspire disgust.
Followers of the Tao spurn them.
