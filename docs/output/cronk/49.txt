The Tao–Master does not have his heart set on anything in particular.
He wants to understand the hearts of the people.
He is good to people who are good.
He is also good to people who aren't good.
This is true goodness.
He trusts people who are trustworthy.
He also trusts people who aren't trustworthy.
This is true trust.
The Tao–Master radiates peace and harmony.
Through him, the hearts of the people are made one.
Are the people his children, or is he their child?
