That which is lying still is easy to pick up.
That which has not yet happened is easy to prevent.
That which is brittle is easily shattered.
That which is small is easily scattered.
Deal with things before they become problems.
Straighten things out before they become confused.
A huge tree begins as a tiny sprout.
A terrace nine storeys high begins as a small pile of dirt.
The giant pine tree grows from a tiny sprout.
A thousand–mile journey begins with a single step.
Intrude and ruin.
Grasp and lose.
Therefore, the Tao–Master practices non–ado and so does not ruin;
he is not grasping and so does not lose.
People often fail just when they are about to succeed.
Be as careful at the end as you are at the beginning,
and you will not fail.
Therefore, the Tao–Master desires no–desire,
treasures no treasures, studies no studies.
He pays attention to what others have ignored.
He helps all things find their center,
all without ado.
