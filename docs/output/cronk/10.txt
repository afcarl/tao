Can you keep body and soul together
and find your wholeness in the One?
Can you make your breathing as soft as a newborn child's?
Can you cleanse your inner vision
until you see with perfect clarity?
Can you love the people and govern the country without ado?
Can you, like a woman, open and close the gates of Heaven?
Can you understand all things and take no action?
Giving birth and nourishing, having but not owning,
acting without seeking praise, leading but not dominating:
this is the highest virtue [Te].
