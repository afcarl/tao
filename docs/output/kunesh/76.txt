At birth a human is soft and flexible,
at death a human is hard and fixed.
In life all things, plants and animals,
are soft and flexible,
but
in death all things
are hard and fixed.
What is hard and fixed is death's friend;
what is soft and flexible is life's friend.

The hard and fixed weapon will break,
the hardwood tree will be cut down,
the high shall be made low,
the first shall be last,
the poor and the meek
will win.
