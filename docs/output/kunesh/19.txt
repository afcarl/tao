Give up knowledge and wisdom
give up tests and degrees
and it will be a better for everyone.
Renounce kindness, morality, and justice,
and people will return to love and mercy.

Get rid of professionalism, eliminate profit, give up luxuries,
and theft and embezzlement will disappear.

If this advice is too complicated
then follow
simplicity
selflessness
and the lessening of desires.
