When the way is followed
railroad tracks become bicycle paths

king lots and highways get plowed under
oil cushions the crust of the earth.
When the way is not followed
railroads haul weapons and fuel
food and energy are stockpiled
the earth is bled away and sold.

No motive is more compelling
than wanting what others have
no illness more debilitating
than dissatisfaction with what one has
no better forecast of failure
than wanting more.

Knowing
the satisfaction
of being content
with the simple life
a wise person will always be satisfied.
