In wanting to live life more fully
one dies.
Some people live forcefully in order to evade death.
Some people die within themselves in order to evade life.
Some people just survive with a human body
as life becomes a thing to have or get or lose.

But others who follow the way seem to be impervious
to car accidents or woods at night or the bomb.
Stray cars find nothing to hit,
the woods contain no lions or tigers or bears,
the bomb finds no bodies to burn.

Why?
Because people prepared to die live
and those prepared to live die.
Life generates death
and death life.
