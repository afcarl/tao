The softest
overcomes the hardest.
Having no form to maintain
it can go where there is no space.
Water wears down and splits rock with no intention
this is how I know the value of action that has no motivation.
Yet few people understand the value of
teaching without words
relationship without promise
being without doing
religion without god.
