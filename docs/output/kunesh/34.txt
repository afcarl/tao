The follower of the way
is like a hawk
drifting
on unseen currents
back and forth
up and down.
All beings and things
are connected to it
solid or gas
bad or good
fact or fiction
sexual or neuter
nothing is denied
nor is anything controlled.
The way,
although existing in everything,
controls nothing
and seems nonexistent.

Everything follows it
although none of us know how
so it must be something great.

Quality is known
by the lack of its demonstration.
