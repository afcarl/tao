Persons that follow the way are like
a baby that
bees and mosquitoes do not sting
dogs and cats do not bite
birds do not peck.
Soft bones, weak muscles, strong grip
no need of sex, but perfectly formed by it.
Baby lives completely
screaming all day without becoming hoarse
Its needs fulfilled
it sleeps in perfect harmony.
To understand this harmony
is to understand the universe;
to understand the universe
is enlightenment.

Filling one's life with busyness is to invite
disaster,
pushing oneself to the edge
exhausts,
for every effort
there is a loss.

This is not the way
and what is not the way
will soon die away.
