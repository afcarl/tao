If your authority is not sufficient
relax
let go
the power of the universe will suffice.
Do not restrict others
or make them do things you want
let go
and they will stop running from you.

The wise
know themselves,
know their power
but do not show it,
know their own quality
but do not use praises or titles.

Let go
of that
take this.
