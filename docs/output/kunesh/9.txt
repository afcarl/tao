Better to underfill
than to overfill a cup.
The overstretched bow
soon breaks.

The constantly sharpened blade
soon dulls.

A house full of possessions and wealth
cannot always be protected.

A mind full of morality and social convention
will not always be right.

Materialism and ambition
bring their own ruin.

Draw back
from your completed work and fame.
This is the way
of water.
