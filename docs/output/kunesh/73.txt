People who are brave and who like dares
kill and destroy.
People who are brave and have no taste for daring
live and create.
Either may be appropriate,
both may be good and bad
still,
the universe has no taste for blood,
neither does the follower of the way.
The universe never tries to win
still,
it always does;
never tries to speak
still,
there is always an answer;
never tries to command
still,
everything is ordered.

The net of the universe is wide ,
its mesh is wide
still,
nothing escapes.
