The way of the universe
is like
pulling the string of a bow
the bow bends
the top descends
the bottom ascends.
The way of the universe is
to take from the wealthy
and give to the poor.
The way of humanity is
to take from the poor
and give to the wealthy.

There is only one way that a person can have so much
that there is enough to give to poor and wealthy alike.
How?
By following the way,
directing but never with force,
accomplishing but never praised,
better than others
but unknown.
