The best leaders stay with their local people
the best fighters are cool and calm
the best commanders win without engaging the enemy
the best supervisors act like the lowest employees
the best healers cure without medicine
the best laws have no transgressors
the best priests have no faith.
This is called power

power that comes with flowing with the way
power that is able to guide people
power that is mate to the universe
the oldest power.
