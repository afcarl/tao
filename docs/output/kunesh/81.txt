sweet-sounding words are not true.
Good people do not prove things by argument
those who prove things by argument are not good.

Wisdom is different from book learning
book learning means little wisdom.

Wise people have no need to store things up
when all has been given to others
they have more than before.

The path of the universe
is to attain the end
without means

do
without acting.
