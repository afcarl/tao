Living both an emotional and intellectual life,
can you join them without separation?
Breathing and moving,
can you be as soft as a child?
Seeing,
can you narrow and sharpen your focus
on the universe till it is perfect?
Loving,
can you care for and lead all the people
without becoming known as the care-provider and leader?
Opening and closing the gates of life and death
can you remain powerless?
Knowing and understanding science, reason and politics,
are you able to let it go?
Create and sustain ideas and things,
but do not attempt to control them.
Manage them, but do not ask them for credit or favors.
Guide them, but do not dominate.
This is the way of the universe.
