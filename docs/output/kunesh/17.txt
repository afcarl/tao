A master's existence
is rarely known.
A good person's presence
is widely known
and praised and imitated.
A person who collects power
scares others and makes them fearful, small and hateful.
Without total trust
there is no trust.
Better to have
no trust
and accept everything.

Without talking-about
without writing-about
a master takes action.
When it is done
everyone says
it just happened
naturally.
