The universe acts only according to the laws of nature
even though such laws may seem chaotic and elusive.
Chaotic
still there are patterns.
Elusive
still there is life.
Mysterious and obscure
still it contains the essential.
Power that is immeasurable
still is true and active

from before the beginning
til after the end,
through the next beginning and ending.

How do any of us know this?
Look inside.
