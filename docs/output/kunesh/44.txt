Being praised by others
or valued by oneself
which is most important?
You or things,
health or wealth
which is more valuable?

Having things
or losing things
which is better?

The person who saves the most will pay the most in the end;
the one who acquires the most possessions and property
will lose the most in the end.
Attachment causes suffering.

Be satisfied with where you are and what you have
and you will never be sorry.
Be satisfied with when you are
and you will be always
safe, always
secure.
