When nature is forgotten and abandoned,
goodness, justice and morality are created,
and theisms flourish.
When intelligence and knowledge appear,
great advertising campaigns are created,
and religions compete.

When partners and family members are not at peace
they begin talking about relationships and
duties and responsibilities
and spiritual needs.

When there is tension, distrust,
and revolution
in a community,
we hear calls for
loyal followers.
