Perfection seems to be missing something
but like an empty cup
it is perfect.
The fullest seems to be empty
but like the ocean
it is always there.
The perfectly straight line looks crooked
the most intelligent seem stupid
the best speech seems like stuttering.

Activity overcomes cold
but stillness overcomes heat.
Being still,
one puts everything
in its proper place.
