Great perfection appears 'defective,'
but it's usefulness is not diminished.
Great fullness appears 'empty,'
but it's usefulness is not impaired.

Great straightness seems crooked.
Great skill seems clumsy.
Great attainment seems bashful.

Bustling-about vanquishes cold;
standing still vanquishes heat.

Pure and still, one can straighten-out the Universe.
