Rule your state with uprightness,
deploy your troops with craft;
gain all under heaven through noninterference.

How do I actually KNOW this is right?

WELL;

the more 'taboos' or prohibitions under heaven
the poorer the people are.
The more clever the devices the people have
the more confused the state and the ruling house.
The more scientific knowledge there is
the stranger the anomalies that spring up.
The more laws there are in the land
the more bandits and thieves.

Therefore, Sages say:
"I Do Nothing Much Personally
yet the people transform themselves.
I am fond of stillness
yet the people correct their own ways.
I do not interfere in affairs
yet the people enrich themselves.
I desire not to 'desire' it
yet the people of their own accord
are become as simple as un-hewn logs."
