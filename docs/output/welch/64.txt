What is secure is easily grasped;
what has no omens is easily forestalled;
what is brittle is easily split;
what is diffuse is easily dispersed.

Act before need arises;
Bring order before disorder begins.

A tree you could barely wrap your arms around
began as a downy shoot;
A terrace nine layers tall
began with a single basketful of earth;
An ascent of a hundred steps
begins beneath one's foot.

Who 'acts' fails.
Who grasps-on loses.
Sages do not 'act'
therefore they do not fail;
they do not grasp-on
and therefore they do not lose.

In pursuing their affairs,
people often fail when close to success.
Therefore, if one is cautious at both end and beginning,
there will be no failures.

Thus Sages desire to be free of avarice,
and do not prize goods that are hard to come by.
They learn not to be 'learned'
and return to what others leave behind.

Thus they can help the myriad creatures to be natural,
for they dare not 'act!'
