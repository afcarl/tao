The pursuit of learning results in daily increase.
Hearing DEI-ty results in daily decrease!
Decrease and more Decrease,
until you reach Doing Nothing Much Personal.
Through this, no action is left undone.

Should one aspire to attain the Cosmos,
one should remain ever free of Ego-involvements;
For,
just as surely as one becomes Ego-involved,
one becomes unfit to attain the Cosmos.
