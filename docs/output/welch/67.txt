Everybody say I am great;
great but 'quirky.'

Now, precisely because I am 'quirky' I can BE great;
were I 'conventional' I would long ago have been declared 'common.'

I have always had three treasures that I guard and cherish.
The first is compassion; the second is simplicity; and the third
is daring to not out-do everyone in the world.

Now, because I am compassionate, I find I can be brave;
because I am simple, I can be generous;
because I dare to not out-do everyone in the world,
I find I can lead in the finishing of tasks.

If I, today, were to
be courageous while forsaking compassion;
be generous while forsaking simplicity;
get ahead while forsaking the hindmost;
that would be my end!.. for
compassion in war brings true victory;
in defense brings invulnerability.
Whomsoever heaven would defend
it surrounds with a bulwark of compassion.
