A large state is like a great river valley;
the Mother of all under heaven.
In the union of all under heaven
she conquers her ravisher by stillness.
Because she is still,
it is fitting for her to lie low.

By lying beneath a small state,
a large state can take over the smaller.
By lying beneath a large state,
a smaller one can take over the larger state.

Therefore, one may either take over or be taken over, by lying low.

Thus, a large state wishes only to annex and nurture others;
a small state wishes only to join-with and serve others.
Now, since both get what they seek,
it is fitting for the larger state to lie low.
