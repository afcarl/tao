To be sparing of speech is natural.

A whirlwind does last all morning;
A downpour does not last all day.. and who causes THEM?
If Heaven and Earth cannot express such things ceaselessly,
how much less so can human beings?!

Therefore, in pursuing his own affairs;

A person like THOU identifies with THOU.
A person like DEITY identifies with DEITY.
A person who fails has identified with failure.

To one who identifies with DEITY, THOU awards divinity.
To one who identifies with failure, THOU awards failure.
