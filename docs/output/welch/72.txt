When the people do not fear what is majestic,
Great Majesty will soon visit them.

Do not limit their dwellings
nor suppress their livelihoods.
Simply because you do not oppress them,
they will not grow tired of you.

For this reason,
Sages are self-aware,
but do not flaunt themselves;
they are self-focused,
but do not glorify themselves.

They out-grow the one and adopt the other.
