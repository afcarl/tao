Of the many who wish to grab the universe and 'use' it,
Ego has never had even one success.

Now, the universe is a Divine Alembic, not something to 'use.'
Who strives to 'use' it will be defeated;  who grasps it will fail.

Of Creatures;  some march forward, others follow behind;
some tremble in silence, others are puffed-up;
some are agressive, others are meek;
some build things up, others collapse them.

For these reasons, Sages avoid extremism;
avoid excesses;
avoid being grandiose.
