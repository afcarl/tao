When a 'superior' person hears of DEI,
they are scarcely able to put it into practice.
When a 'middling' person hears of DEI,
they appear to now perservere, now lose it.
When a 'common' person hears of DEI,
they laugh out loud.
If they did not laugh, it could not be DEI!

There is a series of old sayings, that go;
"The bright Path seems dim.
The forward Path seems backwards.
The level Path seems bumpy.
Virtuosity seems like a depression.
Great whiteness seems grimy.
Ample skill seems insufficient.
Full DEI seems apathetic.
Plain truth seems sullied.

The great square has no corners.
The great vessel is never completed.
The great note sounds muted.
The great Image is formless.

The Path is hidden, and nameless."

Indeed, this Path alone is good at it's beginning and at it's end.
