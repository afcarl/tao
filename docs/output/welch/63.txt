Act by Doing Nothing Much Personal;
handle affairs through noninterference.
Taste what has no flavor;
regard the small as great, the few as many.
Repay resentment with DEI-ty's virtues.

Undertake difficult tasks
by appreciating what is easy about them.
Do great deeds
by focusing on their little details.

All difficulties under heaven arise from what is simple;
all great things under heaven depend upon little details.

Thus, Sages never strive to do what is great;
therefore they can achieve greatness.

One who lightly agrees
is seldom believed;
One who thinks everything is going to be easy
encounters many problems!

Consequently, even Sages consider things difficult;
and thus, find them easier than they thought, in the end.
