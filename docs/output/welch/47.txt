Without going out of doors,
one may know all under heaven.
Without peering into windows,
one may know the secrets of the Universe.

The farther one goes,
the less one knows!

For this reason,
the Sage knows without needing to journey;
understands without needing to look;
and accomplishes without needing to act.
