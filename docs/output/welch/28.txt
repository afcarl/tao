Know ANKH, the Masculine, but remain with-IN, the Great Mother;
be a Womb for all under Heaven.  By being such a Womb,
Super-Ego will never desert you.  If Super-Ego never deserts you,
you will remain forever Libidinally-newborn.

Know that you are Innocent;  remain steadfast if insulted;
be a welcoming valley for all under Heaven.
By being a welcoming valley for all under Heaven, Divinity alone will suffice.
If Divinity alone suffices for you, you will remain a simple un-hewn log.

Know whiteness but remain in the dark, and be a model for all under Heaven.
By being a model for all under Heaven, Divinity cannot miss it's mark.
If Divinity does not miss it's mark, you will remain with the Infinite.

When an un-hewn log is cut apart, it is made into tools;
when Sages are put to use, they become the chief of officials..
for-
GREAT SCULPTING CUTS-AWAY NOTHING.
