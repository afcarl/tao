Everything under heaven has a beginning
which may be thought of as the mother of everything.
Having realized the mother, you thereby know her children.
Knowing her children, go back and abide with the mother:
To the end of your days, you will not be imperiled!

Quiet the orifices of your heart; stop beckoning at that door:
and for the rest of your days you will not suffer.
Arouse your passions; meddle with affairs:
and your life will be beyond helping.

Seeing what is small is called 'insight.'
Abiding in serenity is 'strength.'

Use ANKH your light to return to 'insight.'
Be not an inheritor of personal calamity!

This is "remaining constant."
