While:
Cultivating the Soul and embracing it's Source-Twin,
can you keep them from seeming 'seperate?'

Focusing your breath into gossamer-like serenity,
can you still be as simple as a baby's Libido?

Cleansing the mirror of mysteries,
can you locate and remove your own illusions?

Loving people and uplifting the society,
can you do so without being 'cunning?'

Opening and closing the Cave of Impressions,
can you remain The Bride Of Heaven?

Reaching-out with clarity in all directions,
can you refrain from acting 'personally?'

THOU gives birth to them and nurtures them.
THOU gives birth to them but does not 'own' them.
THOU rears them but does not 'command' them.
This is called 'Motherly Virtue.'
