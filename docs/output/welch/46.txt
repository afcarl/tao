When DEI-ty prevails under heaven,
swift horses are prized for their fertilizing of fields;
but when DEI-ty has been forgotten under heaven,
war-horses are bred even in the suburbs!

No guilt is greater than Egoic motivations;
no disaster is greater than Egoic discontent;
no crime is greater than the Egoic desire for gain.

Therefore, Contentment that derives from knowing when to be Content
is Eternal Contentment.
