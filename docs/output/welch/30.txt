One who guides a human ruler with THOU does not use force upon the universe.
Such a course is likely to rebound upon it's source.

Where armies have been stationed, briars and brambles tend to grow.

A good General attains the defense, and THAT IS ALL.

They attain the defense, but not 'proudly.'
They attain the defense, but do not boast.
They attain the defense only because THAT IS WHAT MUST BE DONE.

If something grows old while still in it's prime,
that is called 'Not being in accord with THOU.'
Not being in accord with THOU leads to untimely ends.
