Id is 'empty' yet does not 'refill' with use.
Fathomless Id is;  like the ancestor of the countless things.

Id wears-down all sharp edges,
unravels all knots,
diffuses light,
mingles with dust.

Id lies submerged, seeming barely to exist at all.
I know not whose child Id is!.. only that it seems to be the Womb of God.
