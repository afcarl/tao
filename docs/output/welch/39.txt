Originally, these attained Wholeness;
Heaven attained Wholeness, and became 'pure.'
Earth attained Wholeness, and became 'solid.'
The Spirits attained Wholeness, and became 'divine.'
The Cave Of Impressions attained Wholeness, and began to fill.
The Hierarchy attained Wholeness, and all was put 'right.'

Yet, Karma recoiling upon itself, it implies that;
Once Heaven was 'pure' it would be torn asunder;
once Earth was 'solid' it would begin to quake;
once Spirits were 'divine' they would begin to bicker;
once the Cave Of Impressions filled-up, it would run dry;
once the Hierarchy was 'right' and exalted, it would 'fall.'

Because of Karma, it is necessary to be Humbly-Noble;
it is necessary to be Modestly-Exalted.

For this reason, Hierarchs style themselves as
'orphaned and destitute and hapless.'
Is this not because they have learned true humility?

Therefore, since striving for great praise deprives one of it,
consequently do not desire to tinkle like jade
or to ring like the True Stone.
