A person comes forth into Life and passes into Death.

Three out of ten are partners of Life;
Three out of ten are partners of Death;
And those whose every act leads them to Death
because they cling desperately to Life are also three in ten.

Now, what is the Reason for this?!
It is because all of these CLING.

Indeed, I have heard it said that those who can save life
do not avoid tigers or rhinoceroses
when out walking in the hills;
nor do they put on armor and take up weapons
when they approach a battlefield.
The rhinoceros has no place to jab it's horn,
the tiger has no place to fasten it's claws,
and weapons have no place to put their blades.

Now, what is the Reason for this?!
Because in them there is no remaining Mortality.
