The Path is the Alembic of the myriad creatures;
it is the treasure of the good person,
and that which is treasured BY the 'bad.'

Beautiful words can be traded;
Noble deeds can be used as gifts of honor.
Why should we reject even the 'bad' others offer us?!

Therefore, when a Child Of Heaven is enthroned,
or a Triune Ministry installed,
although they may have large and valuable ornaments
and be preceded by teams of four horses,
it would be better for them to sit down
and make progress in THIS!

Why did the ancients value THIS so highly?
Did they not say;
"Seek and ye shall find;
Repent and thou shalt be forgiven"?

Therefore THIS is valued by all under heaven.
