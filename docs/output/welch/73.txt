One who is brave in daring will be killed.
One who is brave but not in daring will survive.
One of these two courses is beneficial, the other harmful.

Who knows the reason for Heaven's preferences?

The way of Heaven is to not make war,
yet it is good at conquering;
does not expound,
yet is good at answering;
will not be ordered-about,
yet comes of it's own free will;
is unconcerned,
yet good at making plans.

Heaven's net is vast;
though it's mesh is wide,
NOTHING ESCAPES.
