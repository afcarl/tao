If Ego had even the slightest knowledge of traveling the Path,
it's only 'fear' would be of going 'astray.'
The Path is quite level, but Egos LOVE mountain trails!

The court may be thoroughly deserted,
the fields all choked with weeds,
the granaries, totally empty;

YET there may still be some who wear bright, fancy clothing,
sharp swords hanging at their sides;
they walk around gorged with food
and overflowing with possessions and wealth:

This is BRAZEN BANDITRY.
This is surely NOT the Path!
