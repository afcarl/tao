THOU gives birth to them, and DEI nurtures them.
Matter forms them and functionality completes them.

Because of this, the myriad creatures respect THOU and esteem DEI-ty.
Respect for THOU and esteem for DEI-ty are by no means 'conferred' on them,
but always occurs naturally.

THOU gives birth to them;
nurtures them
rears them
shelters them
toughens them up
sustains them
protects them.

It gives birth but does not 'claim' them;
acts but does not 'intend;'
rears but does not 'control.'

This is "Mysterious DEI-ty."
