Between "Oh, Certainly!," and "Definitely Not;"
how much difference is there?
Between beauty and ugliness, how great is the distinction?

One who is feared cannot but be fearful, themself.
How confusing!  There is no end of it all.

Libidinally joyous are the masses, as though at a feast,
or as if courting on a terrace in the springtime;
Yet motionless is Ego like a baby before it's first cry,
how dejected!, as if there were no where to turn.

The masses have more than enough,
but Ego alone is bereft.
Ego has the heart of a fool.  How muddled!

Everyone else seems bright and clear;
Ego alone seems confused.
How nebulous, like the ocean!
How blurred, as though without boundaries.

The masses all serve noble Super-Ego's cause;
but Ego alone is stubborn and uncouth.
Ego is 'different.'  Ego is nourished in the Great Mother.
