The recognition of an 'ideal' of Beauty
requires 'Ugliness' to compare it with.
The 'ideal' of Goodness require 'Badness' to compare it to.

Bodily Life and Bodiless Life give birth to each other.
Difficult and Easy give birth to each other, in turn.
Long and Short;  High and Low;  Tone and Voice;  Front and Back;
each give occasion for the other.  It must always be so.

Therefore; the Sage does nothing much very personal,
and carries on a Discourse beyond personalities:
one allows the myriads of things to arise, but does not demand of them.
One acts, but not very 'personally;'  one does one's work,
but without self-importance.

Simply because one 'Mothers' things instead of 'commanding' them,
one's offspring never leave you.
