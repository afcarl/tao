Id and Super-Ego are not 'human.'  They treat all things as
'Totemic Symbols.'

The Sages, too, are not merely 'human;'  they too treat all creatures as
'Totemic Symbols.'

This relating between Id and Super-Ego:  how like a bellows it is!
Empty but inexhaustible, the more it pumps, the more comes out of it.

Most Ego-speech is merely exhausting.  Better to remain with 'Totemic
Symbols!'
