One who knows does not label with words;
one who labels with words does not really know.

ONE WHO
quiets the portals of their heart,
stops beckoning from that door;
diffuses their light;
mingles with dust;
files away their sharp edges and
unravels their tangles

HAS "MYSTICAL SELF-IDENTITY."

Because of it,
neither can one be fully 'intimate' with them
nor can one remain distant from them;
neither can one profit from them
nor can one be harmed by them;
neither can one achieve honor though them
nor can one be dishonored through them.

Because of this, they are esteemed by all under heaven.
