Strategists have a saying:

"I dare not be the host,
but would rather be a guest!
I advance not an inch,
but retreat a foot."

This is called
Marching out of file;
Bearing nonexistent arms;
Flourishing nonexistent weapons; and
Driving back nonexistent enemies.

There is no greater a misfortune
than not having a worthy foe;
once I believe there are no worthy foes about,
I have well-nigh forfeited all my treasures.

Therefore, when opposing forces are evenly matched,
The one who is saddened by that WINS.
