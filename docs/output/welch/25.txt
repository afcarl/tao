Without form, and 'void,' yet whole and complete;
born before Heaven and Earth;
Silent and ephemeral, it stood alone and unchanging.

We may regard it as the Mother of Heaven and Earth.
Not knowing it's name, I call it THOU.
If forced to 'describe' it, I would call it 'Great.'
Greatness implies infinity;  infinity implies recoiling upon itself.

THOU art Great.
Heaven is Great.
Earth is Great.
The King, too, is Great.

Within our Cosmos, there are Four "Greats,"
and the King is one of them.

Humanity patterns itself after IN, the Earth.
Earth patterns itself after ANKH, Heaven.
Heaven patterns itself after THOU.
THOU patterns itself.
