Who is puffed-up cannot stand.
Who is self-important has not importance.
Exhibitionists do not really shine.
Egotists have no real merit.
Flatter yourself and you will not last long!

As for THOU, we may say it sees all such things as 'extra baggage.'
The Fatherly Light does not reward such trivialities.  Therefore, one who
aspires to THOU does not abide in them.
