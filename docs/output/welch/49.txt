Sages never have a mind of their own;
they consider the minds of the common people to be their mind.

Treat well those who are 'good.'
Also treat well those who are 'not good.'
This is Goodness ATTAINED.

Be sincere to the sincere.
Also be sincere to the insincere.
This is Sincerity ATTAINED.

Sages are self-effacing in their dealings with all under heaven,
and bemuddle their own minds for the sake of others.

The common people all rivet their eyes and ears upon them,
and Sages make them giggle like children!
