What is firmly established cannot be uprooted;
what is tightly embraced cannot slip away.

Thus, the prayers of sons and grandsons will never end!

Cultivated in the person, DEI is true.
Cultivated in the family, DEI is ample.
Cultivated in the village, DEI lasts long.
Cultivated in the state, DEI is abundant.
Cultivated everywhere under heaven, DEI is vast.

Observe other people through your own person.
Observe other families through your own family.
Observe other villages through your own village.
Observe other states through your own state.
Observe all under heaven through all of these.

How do I know the nature of all under heaven?  By LOOKING!
