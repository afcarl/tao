Heaven is endless, and Earth is durable.  They are durable and endless
because they do not take anything 'personally.'

The Sages therefore overcome their Ego-interests, and their Souls speak;
they do not think of themselves as their Egos, yet those remain present.

Being beyond their purely Egoic motives, they can accomplish their goals.
