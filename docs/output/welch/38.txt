A 'Virtuoso' does not claim virtuosity..
and therefore, has it.
An aspiring 'virtuoso' can think of nothing else!..
and therefore, is not there, quite yet.

A true Virtuoso Does Nothing Much Personal..
for they have no egoic motives toward their skill.
A true Humanitarian takes action..
but not for any egoic reasons.
A truly 'Righteous' person takes action
only for 'good causes.'

A 'Civilized' person takes action,
but if others do not respond accordingly,
they roll up their sleeves and convince them!

Therefore, when DEI is lost, afterwards comes 'Virtuosity' rediscovered;
When Virtuosity has not yet been rediscovered, there comes 'Humanitarianism;'
when Humanitarianism has been lost, afterwards comes 'Righteousness;'
when Righteousness has been lost there comes 'Civilization' in it's place.

Now, Civilization is the refined product of Trust..
the Karma of Trust is the chaos of trusting the untrustworthy.
Foreknowledge is but the blossoming of DEI,
and not it's final 'proof.'

Therefore, a person like DEI resides in original Wholeness,
not in 'refined products.'
They reside in fruitful 'proof,'
not it's first blossoming promise.

They 'suspect' the one and adopt the other.
