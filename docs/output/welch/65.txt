The ancients who walked the Path
did not seek to enlighten people with it;
they used it, rather, to relax them.

The people are hard to 'rule' if they are too 'sophisticated.'
Therefore, ruling a state through 'information' actually weakens the state;
ruling a state through natural simplicity brings DEI-ty into the state.

One who is always mindful of these two types grasps a great paradigm;
mindfulness of this paradigm is "mystical virtue."

Deep and far runs this Mystical Virtue!
It runs counter to worldly things..  until they reach the great Sea!
