The nature of great DEI-ty is that it grows within Id alone.
Taken by itself, objectively, Id is 'blurred' and 'nebulous.'

How nebulous and blurred!
Yet within Id there are IMAGES.
How blurred and nebulous!
Yet within Id there are OBJECTS.
How cavernous and dark!
Yet within Id there is an ESSENCE.
It's Essence is quite real;
Within Id there are TOTEMS.

From the present back to the ancient past, Id's identity is imperishable.
Through Id, we conjoin with the Father of the masses.

How do I know what the Father of the masses is like?  THROUGH THIS!
