THOU art eternally nameless.

Because the un-hewn log is small, none care to subjugate it.
If Kings and rulers had it, the masses would gladly serve them.

Heaven and Earth unite to bring-forth sweet dew.
Without 'governing' the people, natural equality ensues.

As soon as one carves-up Nature, 'labels' arise.
Once there are labels, one should know that it is time to STOP.
Knowing when to stop, one may avoid peril.

In Totemic terms, the relationship of the universe to THOU
is 'Valley Streams flowing back into the River and the Sea.'
