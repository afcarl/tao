Now, weapons are instruments of ill omen;  Divinity abhors them.
Therefore, one who abides in THOU does not abide weapons.

The Superior Person, at home, honors the more powerful Left-side;
on the battlefield, the more gentle Right-side;

they put Peace above all else,
and refuse to glorify weapons.
If one glorifies weapons, this propagates killing.

One who delights in killing people has no influence with Heaven.

On occasions of celebration, one honors the Left-side;
on occasions of grief, the Right-side is honored more.
A Deputy General stands on the Left side;
their Commander stands at the Right..
in other words, they stand in the order of their gravity of offense.

The killing of masses of people we ought bewail with sorrow and grief.
Victory in battle we ought commemorate with mournful rites.
