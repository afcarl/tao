The River and the Sea can be Kings
over a hundred valley-streams
because they are good at lying below them.

If Sages want to be be over the people, in teachings,
they must put themselves beneath them.
If one wishes to lead the people,
one must stand behind them.

Thus, one may lead the people without offending them;
one may oversee the people with one's teachings without burdening them;
everyone will happily push one forward without tiring of one's example;
and is this not because one is free of competition?

Because one does not compete with the people, none can oppose you.
