Nothing under heaven is gentler or weaker than water,
and yet nothing is better at cutting-through what is hard and strong,
because it is relentless.

This defeat of the hard by the soft, the strong by the weak-
this is known to everyone in the world,
yet nobody actually practices it.

Therefore Sages say:

"One who bears abuse directed against the state
is called 'Lord of the altars of the gods of soil and grain;'
One who bears the misfortunes of the state
is called the 'King of all under Heaven.'

True words SEEM contradictory!
