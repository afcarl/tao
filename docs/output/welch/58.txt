When a society is composed of free, self-governing individuals,
the people are honest;
when there is a 'legalistic' government 'ruling' the people,
a true society is lacking.

Disaster brings-forth the best in people, and new innovations;
having more than one's own share is that wherein Disaster lurks!
Who knows where this will end?!

When there is no uprightness,
correctness reverts to craftiness;
goodness reverts to the gruesome.

The delusion of mankind;
how LONG has been it's Reign!

For this reason, be:

Solid but not abrasive;
Pointed but not agressive;
Right-On but not arrogant;
Bright but not dazzling.
