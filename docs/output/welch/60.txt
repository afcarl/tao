Properly ruling a big kingdom is like cooking a small fish.

If one oversees all under heaven in partnership with THOU,
'monsters' do not exist.
Not only that, but
their 'existance' could not harm anyone!
Not only could they not harm anyone,
but the ruling Sage does them no harm either.

Now, when neither scorches the other,
merit in nourished in both: (and the fish is DONE!)
