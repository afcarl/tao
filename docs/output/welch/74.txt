If there is someone who doesn't fear death,
why threaten to kill them?
If people did fear death
and one were to capture and kill the devious few,
who would dare to be devious?:

if the people are always at risk of execution,
there will never lack an executioner.

Now, to kill like an executioner is like-

hacking at wood, instead of masterful carpentry;
few are there who can escape cutting their own hands!
