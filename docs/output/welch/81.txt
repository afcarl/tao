Sincere words are not 'elegant.'  Elegance of speech is insincere.
One who knows is not 'learned;' Learnedness is not knowledge.
One who is 'good' does not have much;  Possessions are not virtue.

Sages do not hoard.
The more they do for others,
the more they have, themselves;
the more they give to others,
the more their own bounty is increased.

Thus the Path of DEI-ty benefits without harming;
the way of ego 'acts' but without effect.
