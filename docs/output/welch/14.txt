Look; Id cannot be seen.
It is 'subtle!'
Listen; Libido cannot be heard.
It is 'unique!'
Reach; Super-Ego cannot be grasped-upon.
It is 'serene.'

These three are unfathomable;
They are bound together into a Unity.

Concerning your Unity:
It's height is not 'distant;'
it's depth is not 'blurred.'
Extended infinitely, it merges with NOTHING PERSONAL.
This is "the Form of the formless:"
the 'business' that is Non-Personal.
This is "Disembodied Form," or YOUR SPIRITUAL IDENTITY.

Looking backwards, you cannot see it's beginnings.
Looking forwards, you cannot see where it leads.

Adhering to the Business of Today,
managing the actualities of the moment,
you may comprehend your primeval beginnings.

THIS IS THE VERY STORY-LINE OF YOUR BEING.
