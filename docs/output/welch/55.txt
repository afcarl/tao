One who fully embodies DEI is like a ruddy infant.

Wasps, spiders, scorpions and snakes
do not sting or bite them;
Rapacious birds and fierce beasts
do not seize them.

Their bones are weak and their sinews, soft
yet their grip is tight.
They have not known the joining of male and female,
yet they are sexually aroused!
Their Libido is at it's peak.

They can scream all day long without becoming hoarse;
Their harmony has reached it's perfection.

Striving to increase one's life is ominous;
to control one's vital breath with the mind entails force.

Something that grows old in it's prime
is said to not be in accord with the Path.
Not being in accord with the Path leads to an early demise.
