Human hunger
is the result of governmental profiteering.
Because of THAT, there is hunger.

The common people are not 'governable'
because of their 'superiors' own behavior.
Because of THAT, they are not governable.

The people are 'entertained' by death
because of too much emphasis on preserving their lives.
Because of THAT, death is their 'entertainment.'

Now, only Great Benevolence who acts not for the sake of outer life
is wiser than those who value their own skin very highly.
