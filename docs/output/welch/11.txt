Thirty spokes converge on the single hub of a wheel,
but it is the empty hole in the middle which makes a cart possible.

Clay must be shaped with skill to make a pot,
but it is the empty hole in the middle which makes it useful.

Cut doors and windows into four walls to make a room,
but it is the empty space between them that makes it comfortable.

Therefore, while benefits may be derived from something,
it is in EMPTY NOTHING that we find usefulness.
