To organize mankind and serve heaven,
there is nothing like 'thrift!'

Now, only through thriftiness
can one be prepared;
being prepared
means having a large store of DEI.
With a large store of DEI
one can overcome anything.
Being able to overcome anything,
no one knows your limits!
If no one knows what you are capable of,
you may have your Kingdom.
Being the Mother of a Kingdom,
one can long endure.

This is called "planting your roots firm and deep,
the Path of long life and lasting vision."
