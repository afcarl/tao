IF..

it is bent, it will be kept intact;
if it is crooked, it will be straightened.

it is sunken, it will be filled-up.

it is worn-out, it will be renewed.

it has little, it will gain more.

it gets too much, it may get confused!

THEREFORE..

The Sage remains in Unity,
and serves as the shepherd of all under Heaven.
Not being self-interested, one shines-forth;
not being an exhibitionist, one is distinguished;
not being egotistical, one has merit;
not flattering oneself, one may long endure.

Now, simply because one is not competing, none will compete with you.
The old saying about the flexible being preserved is right on the mark!

Truly, one will be returned, intact.
