Being 'favored' is a shocking disgrace.
Being 'honored' is as great an affliction as the body.

If one were never 'favored' disgrace could not touch you.
If one were not embodied, there could be neither 'honor' nor affliction.

Therefore, when one merely minds one's own affairs
rather than 'taking care of the universe'
the universe may be entrusted to you;
and when one does not afflict oneself while 'taking care of the universe'
then a  universe can be safely delivered over to you.
