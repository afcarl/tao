The five colors causes one's eyes to become blind.
Racing horses and hunting causes one's mind to go mad.
Goods that are hard to obtain, pose an obstacle to one's travels.
The five flavors confuses one's palate.
The five tones causes one's ears to go deaf.

Therefore, in the government of the sage:
He is for the belly and not for the eyes.
Thus he rejects that and takes this.

The five colors
green, red, yellow, white and black

The five flavors
sweet, bitter, salty, sour and pungent

The five tones
C, D, E, G and A
