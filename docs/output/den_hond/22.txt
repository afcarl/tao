Bent over, you will be preserved whole;
When twisted, you will be upright;
When hollowed out, you will be full;
When Worn out, you will be renewed;
When you have little, you will attain much;
With much, you will be confused.

Therefore the Sage embrace the One
and in this way becomes shepherd of the World.
He does not show himself off;
Therefore he becomes prominent.
He does not put himself on a display;
Therefore he brightly shines.
He does not brags about himself;
Therefore he receives credit.
He does not praise his own deeds;
Therefore he can long endure.

It is only because he does not compete,
That therefore no one is able to compete with him.
The so called "Bent over, you will be preserved whole"
Of the the ancients was an expression
that was really close to it!
Truly "wholeness" will belong to him.
