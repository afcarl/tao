Fot those who like to take control
of the world and act on it -
I see that with this they simply will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel;
It is not something that can be acted upon.
Those who act on it, destroy it.
Those who hold on it, lose it.

With things - some go forward, others follow;
Some are hot - others submissive and weak;
Some rise up - while others fall down;

Therefore the Sage avoids extremes,
Excesses, and extravagance.
