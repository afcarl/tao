When the highest type of men hear of Way
With diligence they are able to practice it;
When average men hear of Tao
Some things they retain and others they lose.
When the lowest type of men hear of Way
They laugh out loud at it.
If they did not laugh at it,
It could not be regarded as the Way.

Therefore, there is a set saying about this that goes:

The bright Way appears to be dark;
The Way that goes forward appears to retreat;
The smooth Way appears to be uneven;
The highest Virtue is empty like a valley;
The purest white appears to be soiled;
Vast Virtue appears to be insufficient;
Firm Virtue appears to be thin and weak;
The simplest reality appears to change.

The Great Square has no corners;
The Great Vessel takes long to complete;
The Great Tone makes little sound;
The Great Image has no shape.

The Way is great but has no name.
Only the Way is good at beginning things
and also good to bring everything to fulfillment.
