The highest good is like water.
Water give life to the ten thousand things and yet does not compete with them.
It flows in places that the mass of people detest
and therefore is it close to the Way
In dwelling, the good thing is the land.
In the mind, the good thing is depth.
In giving, the good thing is being like Heaven.
In speeking, the good thing is sincerity.
In ruling, the good thing is order.
In affairs, the good thing is ability.
In action, the good thing is timeliness.
It is only because it does not compete,
that therefore it is without fault.
