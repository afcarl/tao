Were I have the least bit of knowledge,
In walking on a Great Road
it is only going stray that I Would fear.
Keeping to the main road is easy,
But people greatly delight in tortuous paths.

The courts are swept very clean;
While the fields are full of weeds;
And the granaries are all empty.
Their clothing - richly embroidered and colored,
While at their waists they carry sharp swords,
And indulge themselves with food and drink;
And of possessions they have plenty.
It is called thievery!
And thievery is certainly not the way of Tao.
