Heaven and Earth are impartial;
They regard the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The wise are impartial;
He regards the common people as straw dogs.
The space between heaven and Earth -
Is it not like a bellows?.
It is empty but not depleted;
Move it and more [always] comes out.
Much learning means frequent exhausting.
That is not so good as holding on to the mean.
