The whole world says, I am the Great;
Great and unlike everyone else.
But it is precisely because I am unlike everyone else,
That I am therefore able to be the Great.
Were I like everyone else,
For a long time now I would have seemed
insignificant and small.

I hold and keep three treasures;
Hold on to them and treasure them.
The first is compassion;
the second is frugality;
The third is not presuming to be
At the forefront of the world.
Now. it is because I am compassionate
that I therefore can be courageous;
And, it is because I am frugal
that I therefore can be generous;
And it is because I do not presume
To be at the forefront of the world,
That I therefore can be the head
of those with complete talent.

Now, if you abandon this compassion,
and yet try to be courageous,
And if you abandon this frugality,
And yet try to be generous;
And if you abandon this staying behind
And yet try to be first.
Then you will die

If with compasssion you attack, you will win;
If you defend, then you will stand firm.

When Heaven is about to establish him,
It is as though he surrounds him
with the protective wall of compassion.
