Use the upright and correct to order the state;
Use surprise tactics when you use troops.
Use unconcern with affairs
To take control of the world.

How do I know that this is so?
Well, the more taboos and prohibitions
There are in the world,
The poorer the people will be;
The more sharp weapons the people possess,
The more muddled the states will be.
The more knowledge and skill people have,
The more novel things will appear.
The more legal matters are made prominent,
The more robbers and thieves there will be.

Therefore the words of the Sage say:
I do nothing,
And the people of themselves are transformed.
I love tranquility,
And people of themselves are upright.
I am unconcerned with affairs,
And the people of themselves become rich.
I desire not to desire,
and the people of themselves
Are genuine and simple,
like unvarved wood.
