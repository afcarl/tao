The Tao gave birth to the One.
The One gave birth to the Two.
The Two gave birth to Three.
And the Three gave birth to the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things carry Yin on their backs
and embrace Yang.
Through the blending of Ch'i
They achieve a state of harmony .

The things that are hated in the whole world
Are to be orphaned, widowed and worthless.
Yet Kings and lords take these as their names.
Thus with all things - some are increased by taking away;
While some are diminished by adding on.

Therefore, what other men teach,
I will also consider and then teach to others.
Thus, the strong and violent do not come to a natural end.
I will take this as the father of my studies.
