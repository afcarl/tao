To understand others is to have wisdom;
To understand yourself is to be wise.
To conquer others is to have strength;
To conquer yourself is to be strong.

To know when you have enough is to be rich.
To go forward with strength is a sign of ambition.
To lose not your place is to last long.
To die but not to be forgotten -
That is true long life.
