Regard favor and disgrace with alarm.
Respect great distress as you do your own person.

What do I mean when I say
"Regard favor and disgrace with alarm?"
Favor is inferior.
If you get it - be alarmed!
If you lose it - be alarmed!
That is what I mean when I say
"Regard favor and disgrace with alarm."

What do I mean when I say
"Respect great distress as you do your own person?"
The reason that I have great distress
Is that I have a body
Without a body, what distress would I have?

Therefore, to one who values acting for himself
over acting on behalf of the world,
you can entrust the world.
And to one who in being parsimonious
Regards his person as equal to the world,
you can turn over the world.
