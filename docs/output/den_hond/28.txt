When you know the strength of man,
Yet keep a woman's care!
You will be the ravine of the country.
When you are the ravine of the country,
Your constant virtue will not leave.
And when your constant virtue does not leave.
You will return to the state of a little child.

When you know the pure,
Yet keep the soiled!
You will be the valley of the country!
When you are the valley of the country,
Your constant virtue is complete.
And when your constant virtue is complete,
You will return to the state of unvcarved wood.

When you know the white,
Yet keep the black.
You will be the model for the country!
And when you are the model for the country,
Your constant virtue will not go astray,
And when your constant virtue does not go astray,
You will return to the condition without limit.

When uncarved wood is cut up,
It is turned into vessels;
When the sage is used,
He becomes Head of the Officials.
Truly, great carving is done without splitting up.
