The Way is that toward which all things flow.
It is the treasure of the good man,
And that which protect the bad.

Beautiful words can be bought and sold;
Honored deeds can be presented to others as gifts;
Even with things that people regard as no good -
Will they be rejected?
Therefore when the Son of Heaven
is being enthroned or the Three Ministers installed,
Though you might salute them with gifts of jade
Preceded by teams of four horses,
That is not so good as siiting still and offering this.
That is the reason why he ancients
valued this - what was it?
Did they not say,
Those who seek with this, will attain,And thodse who commit offenses with this, will escape?
Therefore, it is the most valued thing in the world.
