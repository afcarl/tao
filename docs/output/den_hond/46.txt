When the world has the Way,
Ambling horses are retired to fertilize fields.
When the world lacks the Way
War horses are bred outside the city.
Of sins - none is greater
than having things that one desire,
Of disasters - none is greater
than not knowing when one has enough.
Of defects - none brings greater sorrow
than desire to attain.

Therefore he who knows that enough
is enough is abiding contentment indeed.
