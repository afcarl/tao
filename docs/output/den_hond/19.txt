Give up sainthood, renounce knowledge,
And the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Eliminate humanity, renounce righteousness,
And people will return to filial piety and compassion.
Give up ingenuity, renounce profit,
And bandits and thieves will disappear.

These three sayings -
Regarded as a text are yet not complete.
Thus we must see to it
That they have the following appended:

Manifest plainness and embrace the genuine;
Lessen selfinterest and make your desires few,
Eliminate learning and have no undue concern.
