My words are easy to understand
and easy to put in practice,
Yet no one in the world do understand them,
And no one put them into practice.

Now, my words have an ancestor.
And my deeds have a lord.
And it is simply because [people]
have no understanding [of them],
That they therefore do not understand me.

But when those who understand me are few;
Then I am of great value.
Therefore the sage wears coarse woolen cloth
But inside it, he holds on to jade.
