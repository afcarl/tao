We come out into life and go back in death.
The companions of life are thirteen;
The companions of death are thirteen;
And yet people, becuse they regard life as LIFE,
In all of their actions move forard to the thirteen
that belong to the realm of death.
Now, why is this so?
Because they regard as LIFE.

You have no doubt heard of those
who are good at holding on to life:
When they walk through hills,
They do not avoid rhinoceros or tiger.
When they go to battle,
They do not put on armor or shields:
The rhinoceros has no place to probe with its horn;
The tiger has no place to put its claws;
And weapons find no place to hold their blades.
Now, why is this so?
Because there is no place for death in them.
