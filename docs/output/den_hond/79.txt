To make peace where there has been great resentment,
There is bound to be resentment left over.
How could this be regarded as good?
Therefore the Sage holds The right tally
Yet makes no demands of others.
For this reason, those who have virtue
are in charge of the tally;
Those without Virtue are in charge of the taxes.
The Tao of Heaven is impartial
It stays always with the good men.
