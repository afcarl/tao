To hold it upright and fill it to the brim,
is not so good as stopping in time.
When you pound it out and oversharpens the blade,
the edge will soon blunt.
When gold and jade fills your rooms,
You will never be able to protect it.
Arrogance and pride with wealth and titles,
bring on their own disaster.
Retire when the work is done,
Such is the way of Heaven.
