The highest virtue is not virtuous;
Therefore it truly has virtue.
The lowest virtue never loses sight of its virtue;
Therefore it has no true virtue.

The highest virtue takes no action
Yet it has no reasons for acting this way.
The highest humanity takes action,
Yet it has no reasons for acting this way.

The highest righteousness takes action
And it has its reasons for acting this way;
The highest propriety takes action
And when no one responds to it,
Then it angrily rolls up its sleeves
And forces people to comply.

Therefore when Tao is lost,
Only then do we have virtue.
When virtue is lost, only then do we have humantiy.
When humanity is lost, there is righteousness.
And when righteousness is lost,
Only then do we have propriety.
As for propriety,
It is but the thin edge of loyalty and sincerity,
And the beginning of disorder.
And knowledge of the future
Is only a flowery trapping of Tao.
It is the beginning of folly.

Therefore the great man
dwells in the Thick and not in what is thin.
and not what is on the surface,
Dwells in the fruit and not in what is a flower.
Therefore accept the One and reject the other.
