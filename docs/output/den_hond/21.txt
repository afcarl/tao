Follows only from the Way.
As for the nature of the Way -
It is without shape or form.
Formless! Shapeless! Inside there are images.
Shapeless! Formless! Inside there are things.
Hidden! Obscure! Inside are there essences.
These essences are very real,
Inside them is the proof.

From the present back to the past,
its name has never gone away.
It is by this that we comply
with the father of the multitude of things.
How do I know the father of the multitude is so?
By this.
