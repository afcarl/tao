A large state is like the lower part of a river.
It is the female of the world.
It is the meeting point of the world.
The female constantly overcomes
The male with tranquility.
Because she is tranquil,
Therefore she is fittinly underneath.

The large state - if it is below the small state,
Then it takes over the small state.
The small state - if it is below the large state,
Then it is taken over by the large state.
Therefore some by being low take over,
And some by being low are teken over.

Therefore a large state merely desires
To unite and rear others;
While the small state desires
To enter and te serve others.
If both get what they want,
Then the large state should
Fittingly be underneath.
