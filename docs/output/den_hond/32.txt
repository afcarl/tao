The Tao is forever undefined.
Though it seems small in its natural state,
No one in the world dares to treat it as a subject.
If kings and lords werer able to maintain it,
The ten thousand things would submit to them on their own.
And Heaven Earth would unite to send forth sweet dew.
By nature it would fall equally on all things,
With no one among the people ordering that it be so.

As soon as we start to establish a system,we have names.
And as soon as there are set names,
Then you must also know when it is time to stop.
By knowing to stop - in this way you averts trouble.
The presence of Tao in the world
is like the relationship of smal valley streams
to rivers and seas.
