To reach Emptyness is what we mean by the extreme.
To maintain tranquility is what we mean by the center
Side by side, the ten thousand things rise and fall
And by this I see their return.
Things come forth in great numbers;
Each one returns to its source.
This is called tranquility,
"Tranquility" - This mean to return to your fate.
To return to your fate is to be constant.
To know the constant is to be wise.
Not to know the constant is to be reckless and wild.
If you're reckless and wild,
Your actions will lead to misfortune.

To know the constant, is to be open-minded.
To be open-minded, is to be impartial.
To be impartial, is to act royally.
To be royal, is to be like Heaven.
To be like Heaven is to be [one with] the Tao.
If you are one with the Tao,
You will suffer no harm till the end of your days,
