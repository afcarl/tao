Those who talk do not know about it.
He blocks up his holes,
Closes his doors,
Softens the glare,
Settles the dust,
Files down the sharp edges,
And unties the tangles.
This is called the profound union.

Therefore, there is no way
To get intimate with him.
There is no way to benefit him,
But there is also no way to harm him.
There is no way to ennoble him.
But there is also no way to debase him
For this reason he is the noblest thing in the world.
