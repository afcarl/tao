To talk little, is the way of Nature.
Fierce winds do not last all morning.
Heavy rain does not last all day.
Who makes these things!
If even Heaven and Earth
Cannot make these things last long,
How much more is this true for man?

Therefore one who devotes himself to Tao
Is one with Tao.
One who devotes himself to Virtue [and attainment]
is one with Virtue.
One who devotes himself to losing
is one with that loss.

To the one who is one with Virtue,
Tao also gives Virtue.
While for the one who is one with his loss,
Tao also disregards him.
