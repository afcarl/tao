Therefore When the great Tao is rejected,
the virtues of humanity and righteousness arise.
When knowledge and wisdom appear,
It is then that the great hypocricy begins.

When the six relations are not in harmony,
Filial piety and compassion arise.
And when the country is in chaos and confusion,
it is then that Virtuous officials appear.

The six relations
Father, sun, older brother,
younger brother, husband and wife
