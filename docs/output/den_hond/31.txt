As for weapons - they are instruments of ill omen;
And among creatures there are those that hate them.
Therefore, who is a follower of Tao, never use them.
When the wise man is at home, he prefers the left.
When at war, he honors the right.
Therefore, they are not a wise man's tools.

Weapons are instruments of ill omen;
When you have no choice to use them,
It is best to remain trnquil and calm.
You should never look upon them
As things of beauty.
If you see them as beautiful things -
This is to delight the killing of men.
And when you delight in the killing of men;
You will not realize your goal in the land.

Therefore, on happy occasions we honor the left,
But in mourning we honor the right.
Therefore, in the army the general stands on the left,
And the commander-in-chief stands on the right.
Which is so to say, that war is conducted like a funeral.
When multitudes of people are killed,
We stand before them in sorrow and grief.
When we are victorious in battle,
We treat the occasion like a funeral ceremony.
