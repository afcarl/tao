Heaven endures; Earth last a long time.
The reason why Heaven endures
And Earth last a long time,
Is that they do not live for themselves,
Therefore they can long endure.
Therefore the sage puts himself in the background,
Yet finds himself in the foreground.
Puts selfconcern out of [his mind],
Yet finds that his selfconcern is preserved.
It is not that he has no self-interest,
That he is therefore able to attain fulfillment.
