Those who work at their studies
Increase day after day;
Those who have heard the Tao
Decrease day after day.

They decrease and decrease,
till they get to the point where they do nothing.
They do nothing and yet there is nothing left undone.
When someone wants to take control of the world,
He must always be unconcerned with affairs.
For in a case where he is concerned with affairs,
He will be unworthy as well,
of taking control of the world
