Of Those in ancient times
That attained the one -
Heaven by attaining the One became clear;
Earth by attaining the One became stable;
Gods by attaining the One became divine;
Valleys by attaining the One became full;
Kings and lords by attaining the One,
Made the whole land ordered and secure.

Talking this to its logical conclusion we would say -
If Heaven were not by means of it clear,
It would, I'm afraid, shatter.
If the Earth were not by means of it stable,
It would, I'm afraid, let go.
If the gods were not by means of it divine,
They would, I,m afraid be powerless.
If the valleys were not by means of it full,
They would, Im afraid, dry up.
And if kings and nobles
were not by means of it noble and high,
They would, I'm afraid, topple and fall.

Therefore it must be the case
That the noble has the base as its root;
And it must be the case
That the high has the low for its foundation.
Therefore kings and nobles call themselves
"The orphan", "The widower" and "The one without grain".
This is taking the base as one's root, is it not?!

Therefore they regard their large numbers of carriages
As having no carriage.
And because of this,
They desire not to dazzle and glitter like jade,
But to remain firm and strong like stone.
