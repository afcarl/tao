Agreement and angry rejection;
How great is the difference between them?
Beautiful and ugly;
What is it like - the difference between them?
The one who is feared by others;
Must I also fear what others fear?
Wild, unrestrained. It will ever come to an end.

The multitudes are peaceful and happy,
Like climbing a terrace in springtime,
enjoying the sacrificial feast of the ox.

But I alone am calm and quiet -
not yet having given any sign.
Like a newborn baby before it learns to smile,
Tired and exhausted,
As though I have no place to return.
The multitudes all have more than they need,
I alone seem to have nothing.
Mine is the mind of a fool - ignorant and stupid!

The common people see things clearly;
I alone am in the dark.
The common people discriminate and make fine distinctions;
But I alone am muddled and confused.
Oh, I am formless!
Like the ocean;
Oh I am shapeless!
As though I have nothing in which I can rest.
The masses all have their reasons for acting;
I alone am stupid and obstinatie like a rustic.
But my desires alone differ from those of others -
For I am nourished by the Mother.
