The Sage constantly has no mind of his own.
He takes the mind of the common people as his mind.

Those who are good, he regards as good.
Those who are not good, he regards also as good.
In this way he attains goodness.
Those who are trustworthy, he trusts.
Those who are not trustworthy, he also trusts.
[In this way] he gets their trust.

As for the Sage's presence in the world - he is one with it.
And with the World he merges his mind.
The common people all fix their eyes and ears on him.
And the Sage treats them all as his children.
