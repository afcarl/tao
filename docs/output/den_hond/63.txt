Act without acting.
Serve without corncern for affairs.
Find flavor in what has no flavor.

Regard the small as large, and the few as many.
And repay resentment with kindness.
Plan for the difficult while it is easy;
Act on the large when it is minute.
The most difficult things in the world
Begin as things that are easy.
The most difficult things in the world
Arise from the minute.
Therefore the sage, to the end,
Does not strive to do the great.
Those who too lightly agree,
Will necessarily be trusted by few;
And those who regard many things as easy,
Will necessarily end up with many difficulties.
Therefore, the Sage always regards things as difficult,
And as a result, in the end he has no difficulty.
