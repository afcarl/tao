When everyone in the world can see beauty as beauty
Than ugliness comes into being.
When everyone knows good as good
Than evil comes into being.
Therefore having and not having arise together.
Difficult and easy complement each other.
Long and short contrast each other:
High and low rest upon each other;
Voice and sound harmonize each other;
Front and back follow one another;
These are all constants.
Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing,
And practices the wordless teaching.
The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease,
But he does not begin them.
He acts on their behalf, yet not taking credit.
When he has done the work, then he forgets about it.
Therefore it lasts forever and it does not leave him.
