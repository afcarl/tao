The Tao flows and drifts everywhere,
both to the left and to the right.
It accomplishes its tasks and completes its affairs,
And yet for this it is not given a name.
The ten thousand things entrust their lives to it,
And yet it does not act as their master.

Thus it is constantly without desires.
It can be named with the things that are small.
The ten thousand things entrust their lives to it,
And yet it does not act as their master.
It can be named with the things that are great.

Therefore the Sage's ability to accomplish the great
Comes from his not playing the role of the great.
Therefore he is able to accomplish the great.
