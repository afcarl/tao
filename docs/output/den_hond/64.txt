What is at rest is easy to hold;
What has not yet given a sign, is easy to plan for;
The brittle is easily shattered;
The minute is easily scattered.
Act on it before it comes into being;
Order it before it turns into chaos.

A tree so big as a man's embrace
Starts out as the tiniest shoot;
A terrace of nine stories high
Rises up from a basket of dirt.
A high place of a hundred or thousand feet high
starts under your feet.

Those who act on it ruin it;
Those who hold on to it lose it.
Therefore the Sage does not act,
And as a result, he does not ruin things,
He does not hold on to things,
And as a result, he does not lose things.
In people's handling of affairs,
They always ruin things
When they are right at the point of completion.
Therefore we say, If you are as careful at the end
As you were at the beginning, you will have no failures.

Therefore the Sage seeks freedom from desire
And does not value goods that are hard to obtain.
He learns not to learn
And returns to what the masses pass by.
He could help the ten thousand things
To find their own nature,
Yet he dare not do it.
