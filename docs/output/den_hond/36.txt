If you wish to shrink it,
You must certainly stretch it.
If you wish to weaken it,
You must certainly strenghten it.
If you wish to desert it,
You must certainly work close with it.
If you wish to snatch something from it,
You must certainly give something to it.

This is called the Subtle Light.
The submissive and weak conquer the strong.

Fish should not be taken out of the depths;
The state's sharp weapons should not be displayed.
