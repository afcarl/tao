Tao is constantly nameless,
Were kings and lords able to maintain it,
The ten thousand things would tranform on their own.
Having transformed, were their desires to become active,
I would subdue them with the nameless simplicity.

Having subdued them with the nameless simplicity,
I would not disgrace them.
By not being disgraced, they will be tranquil.
And Heaven and Earth will
of themselves be correct and right.
