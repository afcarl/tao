By not exalting the worthy,
you prevent people from competing.
By not valuing treasures,
You prevent people from acting like thieves.
By not displaying desirable things,
You prevent people from confusion of the heart.
Therefore the sage rules
by emptying their minds
and by stuffing their bellies,
by weakening their ambitions
and strengthening their bones.
He constantly causes the people
to be without knowledge and desire,
If he can bring about that clever people
will not try to interfere,
than there is nothing that wil not be in order.
