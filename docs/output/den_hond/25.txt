There was something mysteriously formed out of chaos,
That was born before Heaven and Earth.
Quiet en still! Pure and deep!
It stands alone on its own and does not change.
It can be regarded as the mother of Heaven and Earth.
I do not yet know its name.
I style it "The Way".

For lack of a better word, I call it great.
Being great, it flows, it flows far away.
Having gone far, it returns.

Tao is great;
Heaven is great;
Earth is great;
And the king is also great."
These are the four great powers
And the king occupies one place among them.

Man models himself to the Earth.
Earth models itself on Heaven.
Heaven models itself on the Tao.
Tao models itself on what is natural.
