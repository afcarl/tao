Therefore, one who is good at being a warrior,
Does not make a show of his might;
One who is a good in battle does not get angry;
One who is good at defeating the enemy
Does not engage him.
And one who is goed at using men
Places himself below them.
This is called the Virtue of not competing;
This is called the ability to deal with people.
This is called matching Heaven.
It is the high point of the past.
