What is firmly set up
cannot be pulled down.
What is firmly embraced cannot slip away.
And our sons and grandsons, as a result,

When you cultivate it in your self,
Your virtue will then be genuine;
When you cultivate it in your family,
Your virtue will then overflow;
When you cultivate it in your village,
Your virtue will then be long lasting;
When you cultivate it in your nation,
Your virtue will then be abundant;
When you cultivate it throughout the world,
Your virtue will then be widespread.

Use the individual to examine the individual;
Use the family to examine the family;
Use the village to examine the village;
Use the nation to examine the nation;
And use the world to examine the world.
How do I know that the world is so?
By this!
