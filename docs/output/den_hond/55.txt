One who embraces the fullness of Virtue
Can be compared with a newborn child.
Wasps and scorpions, snakes and vipers
Will not sting him;
Birds of prey and fierce beasts
Do not seize him;
His bones are soft, his muscles weak and pliant,
Yet his grip is firm.
He has not experienced the union of
Man and woman, yet his organ is aroused.
This is because his essence is at his height.
He can scream all day,
Yet without becoming hoarse.
This is because his harmony is at its height.

To know harmony is called "the constant."
To know the constant is called "being wise."
To add on to life is called "a bad omen."
For the mind to control the breath -
That is called "forcing things."

When things has reached their prime they get old.
This is called "not the way of Tao."
What is not the Way
Will come to an early end.
