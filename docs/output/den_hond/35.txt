Hold on to the Great Image
And the whole world will come to you.
Come to you and suffer no harm;
But rather know great safety and peace.
Music and food -
For these passing travelers stop.
Therefore, of the Tao speaking, we say:
Insipid, it is ! It is lack of flavor.
When you look at it, it is not sufficient to be seen.
When you listen to it, it is not sufficient to be heard.
Yet when you use it, it can't be used up.
