Tao gives birth to them and Virtue nourishes them.
Substance gives them form
And their unique capacities complete them.
Therefore the ten thousand things
As for their veneration of Tao and their honouring of Virtue -
No one rewards them for it; it is constantly so on its own.

Tao gives birth to them,
nourishes them and matures them,
Completes them, rests them,
Rears them, supports them,
And protect them.
It gives birth to them
But does not try to own them;
It acts on their behalf
But does not make them dependent;
It matures them
But does not rule them.
This is what we call Profound Virtue.
