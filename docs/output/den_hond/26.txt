The heavy is the root of the light;
Tranquility is the master of agitation.
Therefore the gentleman, traveling all day,
does not lose sight of his luggage carts,
Though there are beautiful things to be seen.
When he is safely inside a walled-in tavern
Only then does he trancends all concern.

How can the lord of ten thousand chariots
Treat his own person more lightly than the whole land?
If you regard the things too lightly
Then you lose your roots.
If you are restless, you lose your control.
