In the whole world nothing is softer
and weaker than water.
And yet for attacking the solid and strong,
nothing can beat it,
Because there is nothing that can replace it.
That water can defeat the strong -
That the weak can defeat the strong -
There is no one in the world that does not know it,
and yet there is no one who can put it into practice.
For this reason, the words of the Sage say:
To take on yourself the disgrace of the state -
This is called being the lord of earth and grain;
To assume responsability for all ill-omened events in the state -
This is called being the king of the World.
Correct words seem to say the reverse
Of what you expect them to say.
