Fame or your health: Which matters more?
Your health or your wealth: Which is more precious?
Gain or loss: In which is there harm?

If your desires are great, you're bound to be extravagant;
If you store much away, you're bound to lose a great deal.
Therefore, if you know contentment, you'll be nort disgraced.
If you know when to stop, you suffer no harm.
And in this way you can last a very long time.
