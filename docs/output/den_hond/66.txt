The reason why rivrs and oceans are able
to be the kings of the hundred valleys is
that they are good at being below them.
For this reason they are able to be the kings
of the hundred valleys.

Therefore in the Sage's desire to be above the people,
He must in his speach be below them.
if he would lead them, he must follow behind.
And in his desire to be at the front of the people
He must in his person be behind them;
Thus he dwells above,
Yet the people do not regard him as heavy;
And he dwells in front,
Yet the people do not regard him as posing a threat.
The whole world delights in his praise
and never tires of him.
It is not because he is not contentious,
That as a result, no one in the world
can content with him.
