The World had a beginning,
Which can be considerd as the mother of the World.
Having attained the mother,
In order to understand her children,
If you return and hold on to the mother,
Until the end of your life you will suffer no harm

Block up the holes;
Close the doors;,
And till the end of your life you will not labor.
Open the holes;
Meddle in affairs;
And till the end of your life
you will not be saved.

To perceive the small is called "discernment".;
To hold on to the pliant is called "strength".
If you use the rays, to return to the bright light,
You will not abandon your life to peril.
This is called Following the Constant.
