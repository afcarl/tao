The one who was skilled at practicing Tao in antiquity,
was subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetratingly wise.
His depth cannot be known.
It is only because he cannot be known,
That therefore, were I forced to describe him, I'd say:
Hesitant was he!,
Like someone crossing a winter stream.
Undecided was he!,
As though he was in fear of neighbors on all four sides.
Solemn and polite was he,
Like a visiting guest.
Scattered and dispelled was he!
Like ice that is about to melt.
Genuine unformed was he,
Like uncarved blocks of wood.
Merged, undifferentiated was he,
Opaque, like a muddy pool.
Broad and expansive was he,
Like a valley.
If you take a muddy pool and still it,
It gradually becomes clear.
If you bring something to rest in order to move it,
It gradually comes alive.
The one who preserves this Tao does not desire to become fulfilled.
Therefore he can wear out with no need to be renewed.
