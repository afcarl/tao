When people are born, they are supple and soft;
When they die, they end up stretched and stiff;
When the ten thousand things, grasses and trees are alive,
They are supple and pliant;
When they are death they are withered and dried out.

Therefore we say that the firm and rigid
are the companions of death,
While the supple, the soft, the weak and the delicate
are the companions of life.

If a soldier is rigid, he will not win;
If a tree is rigid, it will come to its end.
Rigidity and power occupy the inferior position;
Suppleness, softness, weakness and delicateness
