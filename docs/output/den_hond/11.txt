Thirty spokes unite in the wheel's hub;
It is precisely where there is nothing,
that makes the wheel so useful.
We shape and fire clay into a vessel;
It is precisely the space within that makes the clay pots so useful.
We chisel out the doors and windows for a room;
It is precisely in these empty spaces that makes the room so useful.
Therefore benefit comes from what is there;
Usefulness comes from what is not there.
