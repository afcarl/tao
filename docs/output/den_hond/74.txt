If the people were constant in their behaviour
and yet did not fear to die,
How could you use execution to threaten them?
If you brought it about that the people
were constant in their behaviour
en moreover feared to die,
And we took those who behaved in abnormal ways
and killed them -
Who would dare act in this way?

If the people are constant and moreover necessarily fear to die,
Then we constantly have one in charge of executions.
Now killing people in place of the one in charge of executions,
This is like cutting wood in place of the master carpenter.
And of those who cut wood in the place of the master carpenter, only few do not hurt their hands.
