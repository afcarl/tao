Sincere words are not showy.
showy words are not sincere.
Those who know are not "widely learned"
Those who are "widely learned" do not know.
The good do not have a lot.
Those with a lot are not good.


The sage accumulates nothing.
Having used what he had for others,
He has even more.
Having given what he had to others,
What he has is even greater.
Therefore, the way of Heaven
is to benefit and not te cause any harm;
The way of Man is to act on behalf of others
And not to compete with them.
