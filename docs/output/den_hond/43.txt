The softest and most pliable thing in the world
Runs roughshod over the firmest thing in the world.
That which has no substance can enter
Into that which has no spaces or cracks.

I therefore know that there is benefit in taking no action.
The wordless teaching, the benefit of taking no action -
Few in the world can realize these!
