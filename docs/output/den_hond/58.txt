When the government is muddled and confused,
The people are genuine and sincere.
When the government is discriminate and clear,
The state is crafty and cunning.

Disaster is that on which good fortune depends.
Good fortune is that in which disaster is concealed.
Who knows where it will end?
For there is no [fixed] "correct".
The correct turns into the "deviant".
And good turns into evil.
People's state of confusion
Has certainly existed for a long time.
Therefore be square but do not cut,
Be sharp but do not stab,
Be straightforward but not unrestrained,
Be bright but do not dazzle.
