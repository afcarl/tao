Those which advise their ruler in the way of Tao,
Do not use weapons to commit violence in the world.
Such deeds easily rebounds.
In places where armies are stationed,
Thorns and brambles will grow.
The good general achieves his result and that is all;
He does not use the occasion to seize strength from it.

He achieves his result, but does not become arrogant.
He achieves his result, but does not praise his deeds.
He achieves his result, and yet does not brag.
He achieves his results, yet he abides with the result
Because he has no choice.
This is called "Achieving one's result without using violence".

When things reach their prime, they get old;
We call this "Not the way of Tao".
What is not the way of Tao
Will come to an early end.
