The Tao of Heaven is like the bending of a bow.
The high it presses down, and the low it raises up.
To those with a surplus, it takes away;
To those without enough, it adds on.
Therefore the way of Heaven
is to reduce the excessive
and increase the insufficient;
The way of Man -
Is to reduce the insufficient
and offer more to the excessive.
Now, who is able to have a surplus
And use it to offer to Heaven?
Clearly it is only the one who possesses Tao.

Therefore the Sage -
Takes action, but do not possess them;
Accomplishes his tasks - but does not dwell on them.
Like this, is his desire
Not to make a display of his worthyness.
