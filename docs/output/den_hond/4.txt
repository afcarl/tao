The Road is an empty vessel;
Yet when you use it, you never need to fill it again.
Deep and still, it seems to be
the source of the ten thousand things!
It blunts the sharpness, it unties the knot,
Soften the glare, and settles the dust.
Submerged, it seems perhaps to exist.
We do not know whose child it is.
It seems to be the forefather of the gods.
