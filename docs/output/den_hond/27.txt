A good walker leaves no track behind;
A good speaker makes no slips;
A good reckoner needs no tally.
A good closer of doors needs no bolt or lock,
And yet no one can open it.
Good binding of knots requires no rope or cord,
Yet no one can loosen it.


Therefore the sage is constantly good
In taking care of all men
And never rejects anyone;
Constantly good in taking care of things;
And never rejects useful goods;
This is called "Doubly bright".

Therefore the good man is the teacher of the good
And the bad man is the raw material for the good.
Do not value one's teacher
And do not cherish the raw goods-
Though one had great knowledge,
He would still be greatly confused.
This is called the essential of the sublime.
