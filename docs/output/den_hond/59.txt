For ordering humanity and serving Heaven,
Nothing is so good as being sparing.
For only if you are sparing can you,
Therefore, early submit to The Way.
Early submission - This is called
To repeatedly accumulate Virtue
If you repeatedly accumulate Virtue,
Then there is nothing you cannot overcome.
When there is nothing you cannot overcome,
No one knows where it will end,
You can possess the state.
And when you possess the mother of the state,
You can last a very long time.
This is called having deep roots
and a firm base.
It is the Way of long life and long-lasting vision.
