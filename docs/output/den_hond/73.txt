If you are brave in being daring, You will be killed.
If you are brave in not being daring, you will preserve life.
With these two things, in one case there is profit,
In the other there is harm.

The things that Heaven hates - Who knows why?
The Tao of Heaven is not to fight
And yet to be good at winning -
Not to speak, and yet to respond with skills -
Not to summon it, yet to let it come on its own -
To be at ease and yet to plan with care.
the Even age is unsure of this.

Heaven's net casts wide.
Though its meshes are course,
nothing slips through.
