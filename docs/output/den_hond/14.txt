We look at it, but do not see it;
We name this "the minute."
We listen to it, but do not hear it;
We name this "the rarified."
We touch it, but do not hold it;
We name this "the level and smooth."

These three cannot be examined to the limit.
Thus they are merged as one.
One - there is nothing more encompassing above it,
and nothing smaller below it.
Boundless, formless! It cannot be named,
and returns to the state of no-thing.

This is called the formless form,
The substanceless image.
This is called the subtle and indistinct.
Follow it and you won't see it back;
Greet it and you won't see its head.
Hold on to the Way of the present -
To manage the things of the present,
And know the ancient beginning.
This is called the beginning of the thread of Tao
