In nourishing the soul and embracing the One,
Can you do it without letting them leave?
In concentrating your breath and making it soft,
Can you make it like that of a newborn babe?
In cultivating and cleaning your profound vision,
Can you do it so that you stay without stain?
In loving the people and giving life to the country,
Can you be without cleverness?
In opening and closing the gates of Heaven,
Can you play the role of woman?
In understanding and being open to all within the four reaches,
Can you do it without using knowledge?

Give birth to them and nourish them,
Give birth to them, but don't try to own them,
Help them to grow, but don't rule them,
This is called the Profound Virtue.
