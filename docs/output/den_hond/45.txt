Great accomplishment seems incomplete,
Yet its usefulness is never exhausted.
Great fullness seems to be empty,
Yet its usefulness is never used up.
Great straightness seems to be twisted;
Great skill seems to be clumsy;
Great eloquence seems to stammer;
Great surplus seems to be lacking.
Activity overcomes cold.
Tranquility overcomes heat.
If you are quiet and tranquil
You can become the ruler of the world.
