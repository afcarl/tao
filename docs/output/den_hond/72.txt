When the people do not respect those in power,
Then what they greatly fear, is about to arrive.

Do not narrow the size of the places in which they live;
Do not oppress them in their means of livelihood.
It is simply because you do not oppress them,
That they therefore will not be fed up.

Therefore the sage knows himself
but does not show himself;
He cherishes himself but does not value himself.
For this reason he lets go of that and chooses this.
