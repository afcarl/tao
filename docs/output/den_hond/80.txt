Let the states be small and the people few -
Bring it about that there are weapons for "tens" and "hundreds",
Yet let no one use them;
Have the people regard death gravely
and put migrating far from their minds.
Though they might have boats and carriages,
no one will use them;
Though they might have armor and weapons,
no one will display them;
Have the people return to the knotting cords
And using them.

They will relish their food,
Regard their clothing as beautiful,
Delight in their customs,
And feel safe and secure in thir homes.
Neighboring sates might overlook one another,
And the sound of chickens and dogs might be overheard,
Yet the people will arrive at old age and death
with no comings and goings between them.
