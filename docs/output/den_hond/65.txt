Those who practiced Tao in antiquity,
Did not use it to enlighten the people,
Rather they used it, to make them dumb.
Now the reason why people are difficult,
Is because their knowledge.
As a result, to use knowlwedge to rule the state
Is thievery of the state.
To use ignorance to rule the state
Is kindness to the state.
One who constantly understands these two,
Also understands the principle.
To constantly understand the principle -
This is called Profound Virtue.
Profound Virtue is deep, is far-reaching,
And together with things it returns.
Thus we arrive at the Great Accord.
