The Dao gives life to them; virtue nurtures them, matter gives them physical form, and characteristic potential completes them.
This is why the myriad things without exception must honor the Dao and esteem virtue.
This honoring of the Dao and this esteeming of virtue, none are ordered to do so, yet it always happens spontaneously.
The Dao gives them life, and virtue nurtures them, that is, grows them, rears them, ensures them their proper shapes, matures them, and protects them.
He gives them life yet possesses them not.
He acts, yet they do not depend on him.
They mature, yet he is not their steward.
This we call mysterious virtue.
