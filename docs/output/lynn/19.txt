Repudiate sagehood and discard wisdom, and the people would benefit a hundredfold.
Repudiate benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people would again be obedient and kind to each other.
Repudiate cleverness and discard sharpness, and thieves and robbers would not exist.
As for these three pairs of terms,
Because they serve as mere decoration,
Give people the chance to identify with something else:
Exemplify simplicity, embrace the uncarved block
Curtail self-interest, and have few desires.
