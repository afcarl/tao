In antiquity, he who was good at being a leader was perfectly in step with mystery in all its subtlety and profundity; so recondite was he that it was impossible to understand him.
Now, because he defies understanding, all I can do is force a description of what he was like: he seemed hesitant, as one might be when fording a river in winter.
He seemed tentative, as one who fears his neighbors on all four sides.
He seemed solemn, oh, as if he were the guest.
He seemed yielding, oh, just like ice when about to break up.
He seemed solid and sturdy, oh, just like an uncarved block of wood.
He seemed empty and receptive, oh, just like a valley.
He seemed amorphous, oh, just like murky water.
Who can take his turbidity and, by stilling it, gradually become clear?
Who can take his quietude and, by stirring it long, gradually come alive?
One who keeps this Dao does not wish to be filled.
For it is only by not getting filled that one can avoid having the cover remade.
