Repudiate learning, and stay free of worry.
Really, how distant can approval be from disapproval?
Or, how far apart can praise and censure be?
One feared by others must also fear others accordingly.
A gulf so vast, oh, it is truly infinite!
Common people, caught up in the pursuit of happiness, behave as if feasting at a great sacrifice or ascending a springtime terrace.
I alone am quiet and indifferent, oh, in an entirely premanifest state [weizhao], just like an infant who has not yet smiled,
Utterly aimless, oh, just as if I had no place to go home.
Common people all have more than enough, but I alone seem to have lost all.
Mine is really the heart/mind of a stupid man!
Absolutely amorphous, oh!
Common people are clearly obvious.
But I alone am cryptically obscure.
Common people are meticulously discriminating,
But I alone muddle everything together.
Floating indifferently, oh, as if out on the sea,
Blown about by the wind, oh, I seem to have no place to stop.
Common people all would have purpose.
But I alone am doltish and rustic.
I alone wish to be different from others and so value drawing sustenance from the mother.
