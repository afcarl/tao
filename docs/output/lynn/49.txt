The sage has no constant heart/mind [changxin] but takes the heart/mind of the common folk as his heart/mind.
The good I regard as good;
those who are not good I also regard as good.
This is to transform goodness into virtue.
The trustworthy I trust;
those who are not trustworthy I also trust.
This is to transform trust into virtue.
The sage resides among all under Heaven with perfect equanimity and impartiality and for the sake of all under Heaven merges his heart/mind with theirs.
[The common folk all fix their ears and eyes on him,]
And the sage treats them all as his children.
