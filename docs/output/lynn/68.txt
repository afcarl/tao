One good at being a warrior is not warlike.
One good at warfare avoids anger.
One good at conquering the enemy does not join with him.
One good at using men places himself below them.
We refer to these as the virtue in not fighting and the power in using men.
Such a one is called a companion worthy of Heaven, the ultimate attainment achieved for all time.
