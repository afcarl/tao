As for those who obtained the One long, long ago,
Heaven is pure by having obtained the One;
Earth is stable by having obtained the One;
the gods have their spiritual power by having obtained the One;
valleys can be filled by having obtained the One;
the myriad things live by having obtained the One;
lords and princes provide constancy to all under Heaven by having obtained the One.
This is how they attain to these states.
If Heaven had not this means to be pure, it would, we fear, deteriorate.
If Earth had not this means to be stable, it would, we fear, disintegrate.
If the gods had not this means to have spiritual power, they would, we fear, terminate.
If valleys had not this means to achieve fullness, they would, we fear, dry up.
If the myriad things had not this means to live, they would, we fear, expire.
If lords and princes did not have this means to achieve loftiness and nobility, they would, we fear, collapse.
Thus it is that nobility uses humility as its roots and loftiness uses lowliness as its foundation.
This is why lords and princes refer to themselves as "the orphan," "the widower," or "the unworthy."
Is this not using humility as the roots?
Is this not so?
Therefore the ultimate number of praises amounts to no praise, so one wants neither "he glows with luster like the jade" nor "he is as hard as hard can be like the stone."
