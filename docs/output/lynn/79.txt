Bring harmony to great resentment, and some resentment is sure to remain.
How could this be considered good?
This is why the sage holds the left half of the tally
And does not place blame on the other party.
A person of virtue concerns himself with his contracts,
And the person of no virtue concerns himself with scrutinizing others.
The Dao of Heaven has no favorites but is always with the good man.
