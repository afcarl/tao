We emerge into life, enter into death.
Three out of ten are adherents of life;
three out of ten are adherents of death;
and there are three out of ten whose way of life also leads them to death.
Why is this so?
It is due to placing too much emphasis on life.
For I have heard that one good at preserving life, when traveling by land, does not encounter the wild buffalo and, when entering the army, suffers no wound from weapons.
The wild water buffalo has no way to strike at him with horn, the tiger has no way to strike at him with claw, and weapons of war have no way to use point or edge against him.
Why is this so?
It is due to the fact that he stays free of the land of death.
