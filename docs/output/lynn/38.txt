A person of superior virtue is not virtuous, and this is why he has virtue.
A person of inferior virtue never loses virtue, and this is why he lacks virtue.
A person of superior virtue takes no conscious action and so acts out of nothing.
A person of inferior virtue takes conscious action and so acts out of something.
When a person of superior benevolence takes action, he acts out of nothing.
When a person of superior righteousness takes action, he acts out of something.
When a person of superior propriety takes action and no one responds, he pushes up his sleeves and leads them to it.
Therefore one resorts to virtue only after losing the Dao, resorts to benevolence only after losing virtue, resorts to righteousness only after losing benevolence, and resorts to propriety only after losing righteousness.
Propriety consists of the superficial aspects of loyalty and trust and is thus the beginning of disorder.
Foresight consists of the flower of the Dao and is thus the origin of duplicity.
This is why the really great man involves himself with its substance and not with its superficial aspects.
He involves himself with its fruit and not with its flower.
Therefore he rejects the one and takes the other.
