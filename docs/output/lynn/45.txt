Great completion seems incomplete, but its functioning is never exhausted.
Great fullness seems empty, but its functioning is limitless.
Great straightness seems crooked.
Great skill seems clumsy.
Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Although the heat of activity conquers cold, quietude conquers heat, so pure quietude is the right way to govern all under Heaven.
