Reputation or one's person, which is dear?
One's person or what he possesses, which is more?
Gain or loss, which is harm?
Thus it is that extreme meanness is sure to result in great expense, and much hoarding is sure to result in heavy loss.
One who knows contentment will not suffer damage to his reputation, and one who knows how to stop will not place himself in danger.
As such, he will last long.
