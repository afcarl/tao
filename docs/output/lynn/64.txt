The secure is easy to maintain; the premanifest [weizhao] is easy to plan for.
The fragile is easy to melt; the tiny is easy to dissolve.
So take action while it still does not exist
And control it before it turns into disorder.
A tree that takes both arms to clasp grows from a tiny shoot;
a nine-story terrace starts from a pile of dirt;
a journey of a thousand li begins under one's feet.
One who takes deliberate action [wei] will become ruined;
one who consciously administers will become lost.
This is why the sage engages in no deliberate action and so never becomes ruined, does not consciously administer and so never becomes lost.
People pursue matters in such a way that they always suffer ruin just when they are about to succeed.
If one is as mindful of ends as he is of beginnings, his endeavors will never end in defeat.
This is why the sage desires to have no desire and does not value goods hard to get.
He learns not to learn and redeems the errors that the mass of common folk make.
Accordingly, he enhances the natural state of the myriad folk but dares not engage in deliberate action.
