All under Heaven say that my Dao is great but seems to have no likeness [buxiao].
The reason why it seems to have no likeness is that greatness is its only attribute.
If it had a likeness, all this time it would have been insignificant!
I have three treasures, which I hold tight and protect.
The first is called "kindness," the second "frugality," and the third is "no presumption that I am first among all under Heaven."
It is thanks to kindness that one can be brave.
It is thanks to frugality that one can be generous.
It is by not presuming to be first among all under Heaven that one can make one's ready device last long.
Now, if one abandons kindness and takes bravery, abandons frugality and takes generosity, and abandons the back and takes first place, such a one will die!
Thanks to kindness, when one takes the field, he is victorious, and, when he takes a defensive position, he holds firm, for it is Heaven that will save him by protecting him with guards of kindness.
