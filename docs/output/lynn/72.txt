If the common folk do not fear force, then such great force will arrive that there will be no restricting them to the boundaries within which they should dwell, no satisfying them within the limits in which they should live.
It is just because one is insatiable
That there is no satisfying him.
Therefore what the sage himself knows he does not himself reveal.
He cherishes himself but does not value himself.
Thus he rejects the one and keeps the other.
