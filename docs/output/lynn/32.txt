The Dao in its constancy is "nameless."
Although the uncarved block is small, none under Heaven can make it his servitor [chen], but, if any lord or prince could hold on to it, the myriad folk would submit spontaneously.
As when Heaven and Earth unite to send down sweet dew, though not one of the people are ordered to do so, they live in harmony of their own accord.
When the cutting of it starts, names come into existence.
Once names exist, one should know to stop.
It is by knowing to stop that danger can be avoided.
As an analogy, the relationship between the Dao and all under Heaven is similar to the way streams and tributaries respond to the river and the sea.
