Let the state be small and the common folk few.
Let there be military equipment for a company, then it would not be used.
Let the common folk take death seriously, then they would not travel far.
Although they had boats and carriages, they would have no occasion to ride in them.
Although they had shields and weapons, they would have no occasion to array them for battle.
Let the people again knot cords, then they would use them.
They would find their food so delicious, their clothes so beautiful, their dwellings so satisfying, and their customs so delightful that, though neighboring states might provide distant views of each other and the sounds of each other's chickens and dogs might even be heard, the common folk would reach old age without ever going back and forth between such places.
