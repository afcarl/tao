Heaven and Earth are not benevolent and treat the myriad things as straw dogs
The sage is not benevolent and treats the common folk as straw dogs.
The space between Heaven and Earth, is it not just like a bellows or a mouth organ!
Empty, it can never be used up.
Active, it produces all the more.
Many words lead to quick exhaustion; better to maintain emptiness within.
