The Dao is the shelter of the myriad things.
It is the treasure of the good man
And the protector of the man who is not good.
Fine words can be used to market it, and noble behavior can be used to influence others by it.
As for men who are not good, how could they ever be discarded?
Thus the son of Heaven is established, and the three dukes are installed.
Although one could promote it by providing them with disks of jade to hold and teams of four horses to lead, this falls short of promoting this Dao by just letting them sit quietly.
How did the ancients show their esteem for the Dao?
Did they not say:
"When beseeching it, one obtains, and, when in violation of it, one is forgiven"?
Thus it was that it was esteemed by all under Heaven.
