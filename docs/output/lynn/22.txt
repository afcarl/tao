Stepping aside keeps one's wholeness intact.
Bending makes one straight.
Being empty makes one full.
Being worn out keeps one new.
Having little gives one access.
Having much leads one astray.
In this way, the sage embraces the One and becomes a model for all under Heaven.
He does not flaunt himself, thus he shines.
He does not insist that he is right, thus his rightness is manifest.
He does not boast about himself, thus his merit is acknowledged.
He avoids self-importance, thus he long endures.
It is because he does not contend that none among all under Heaven can contend with him.
As the ancient saying has it, "Stepping aside keeps one's wholeness intact."
How could this ever be an empty saying!
Truly, such a one will revert to it [nonexistence] with his wholeness intact.
