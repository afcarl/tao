One who has profoundly internalized virtue is comparable to the infant.
Wasps, scorpions, adders, and vipers do not sting or bite him.
Fierce animals do not attack him.
Birds of prey do not seize him.
His bones are soft and sinews pliant, but his grip is firm.
That he is ignorant of the union of male and female yet completely erect
Is because his semen is at the full.
That he can cry all day long yet never grow hoarse
Is because his bodily balance is perfect.
To know how to maintain balance is called "constancy."
To understand constancy is called "perspicacity."
To extend life beyond its natural span is called "inauspicious."
For the heart/mind to control the vital force is called "forcing strength."
Once a thing reaches its prime, it grows old.
We say it goes against the Dao, and what is against the Dao comes to an early end.
