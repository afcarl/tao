One who would assist the ruler of men in accordance with the Dao does not use military force to gain power over all under Heaven.
As for such matters, he is wont to let them revert.
Where armies deploy, there thistles and thorns grow.
The aftermath of great military operations is surely a year of famine.
One good at this desists when result is had and dares not use the opportunity to seize military supremacy.
Have result but do not take credit for it;
have result but do not boast about it;
have result but do not take pride in it;
have result but only when there is no choice;
have result but do not try to gain military supremacy.
Once a thing reaches its prime, it grows old.
We say it goes against the Dao, and what is against the Dao comes to an early end.
