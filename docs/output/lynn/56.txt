He who knows does not speak.
He who speaks does not know.
Block up your apertures;
Close your door;
Blunt your sharpness;
Cut away the tangled;
Merge with the brilliant;
Become one with the very dust.
We call this "one with mystery."
Thus one can neither get close to such a one nor get distant from him.
One can neither benefit nor harm him.
One can neither ennoble him nor debase him.
Thus such a one is esteemed by all under Heaven.
