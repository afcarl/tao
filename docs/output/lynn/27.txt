One good at traveling leaves no tracks or prints.
One good at words says nothing flawed or blameworthy.
One good at reckoning does not use bamboo tallies.
One good at locking up has no lock yet what is locked cannot be opened.
One good at tying up has no cord yet what is tied cannot be untied.
This is how the sage is always good at saving people, so no one is discarded,
Always good at saving things, and so nothing is discarded.
This is what is known as maintaining the light.
Thus the good man is the teacher of men who are not good.
Men who are not good are material for the good man.
But if they do not value their teacher, and he does not cherish his material, no matter how wise, one will become greatly lost.
This is called the "profoundly subtle."
