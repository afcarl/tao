Stay where your earthbound soul is protected, and embrace integrity: can you do this with never a deviation?
Rely exclusively on your vital force, and become perfectly soft: can you play the infant?
Cleanse your vision into the mystery of things: can you make it spotless?
Cherish the people and govern the state: can you do this without intelligence?
The gateway of Heaven, whether it is to be open or shut: can you play the female?
Your bright understanding casts its light over the four quarters: can you stay free of conscious effort?
He gives them life
And nurtures them.
He gives them life, yet he possesses them not.
He acts, yet does not make them dependent.
He matures them, yet he is not their steward.
This we call mysterious virtue.
