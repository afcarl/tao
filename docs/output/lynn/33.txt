One who knows others is wise, but one who knows himself is perspicacious.
One who conquers others has strength, but one who conquers himself is powerful.
One who knows contentment is rich.
One who acts with power has his goal fulfilled.
One who does not lose his place lasts long.
One who dies but is not destroyed has longevity.
