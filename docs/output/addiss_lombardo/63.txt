Act without acting. Serve without serving. Taste without tasting.
Big, little, Many, few, Repay hatred with Te.
Map difficult with easy Approach great through narrow.
The most difficult things in the world Must be accomplished through the easiest. The greatest things in the world Must be accomplished through the smallest.
