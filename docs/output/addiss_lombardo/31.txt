Fine weapons are ill-omened tools. They are hated. Therefore the old Tao ignores them.
At home, honour the left. In war, honor the right.
Good omens honour the left. Bad omens honour the right. The lieutenant on the left, The general on the right As in funeral ceremonies.
Weapons are ill-omened, Not proper instruments. When their use can't be avoided, Calm restraint is best. Don't think they are beautiful. Those who think they are beautiful Rejoice in killing people.
Those who rejoice in killing people Cannot achieve their purpose in this world.
When many people are killed We feel sorrow and grief. A great victory Is a funeral ceremony.
