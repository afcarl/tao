Use Tao to help rule people. This world has no need for weapons, Which soon turn on themselves.
Where armies camp, nettles grow. After each war, years of famine.
The most fruitful outcome Does not depend on force,
But succeeds without arrogance Without hostility Without Pride Without resistance Without violence.
If these things prosper and grow old, This is called not-Tao. Not-Tao soon ends.
