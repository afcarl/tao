The Sage has no set heart. Ordinary people's hearts Become the Sage's heart.
People who are good I treat well. People who are not good I also treat well: Te as goodness.
Trustworthy people I trust. Untrustworthy people I also trust. Te as trust.
Sages create harmony under heaven Blending their hearts with the world. Ordinary people fix their eyes and ears upon them, But Sages become the world's children.
