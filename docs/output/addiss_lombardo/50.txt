Emerge into life, enter death,
Life is only the thirteen body parts. Death is only the thirteen body parts. Human life, moving towards death, Is the same thirteen. Why is this? Because life gives life to substance.
You have heard of people Good at holding on to life. Walking overland they don't avoid Rhinos and tigers. In battle they don't arm themselves.
The rhino's horn find nothing to gore; The tiger's claws find nothing to flay, Weapons find nothing to pierce. Why is this? They have no mortal spot.
