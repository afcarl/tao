The world has a source: the world's mother. Once you have the mother, You know the children.
Once you know the children, Return to the mother. Your body dies. There is no danger.
Block the passage, Bolt the gate: No strain Until your life ends.
Open the passage, Take charge of things No relief Until your life ends.
Seeing the small is called brightness Maintaining gentleness is called strength.
Use this brightness to return to brightness. Don't cling to your body's woes. Then you can learn endurance.
