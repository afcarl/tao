When people are not in awe of power, Power becomes great.
Do not intrude into their homes, Do not make their lives weary. If you do not weary them, They will not becoem weary of you.
Therefore the Sage Has self-knowledge without self-display, Self-love without personal pride, Rejects one, accepts the other.
