Know the male, maintain the female, Become the channel of the world, And Te will endure. Return to infancy.
Know the white, sustain the black, Become the pattern of the world, And Te will not falter. Return to the uncarved block.
Know honour, sustain disgrace, Become the valley of the world, And Te will prevail. Return to simplicity.
Simplicity divided becomes utensils That are used by the Sage as high official. But great governing does not carve up.
