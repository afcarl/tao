Rivers and seas Can rule the hundred valleys Because they are good at lying low They are lords of the valleys.
Therefore those who would be above Must speak as if they are below Those who would lead Must speak as if they are behind.
In this way the Sage dwells above And the people are not burdened. Dwells in front And they are not hindered. Therefore the whole world Is delighted and unwearied.
Since the Sage does not contend No one can contend with the Sage.
