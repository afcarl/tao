Heaven's Tao Is a stretched bow, Pulling down on the top Pulling up on the bottom.
If it's too much, cut. If it's not enough, Add on to it: Heaven's Tao.
The Human Route Is not like this, Depriving the poor, Offering to the rich. Who has a surplus And still offers it to the world? Only those with Tao.
Therefore the Sage Acts and expects nothing, Accomplishes and does not linger, Has no desire to seem worthy.
