Humans are born soft and weak. They die stiff and strong.
The ten thousand plants and trees Are born soft tender, And die withered and sere.
The stiff and strong Are Death's companions The soft and weak Are Life's companions.
Therefore the strongest armies do not conquer, The greatest trees are cut down.
The strong and great sink down. The soft and weak rise up.
