If people do not fear death, How dare you threaten them with death?
But if people with a normal fear of death Are about to do something vicious, And I could seize and execute them, Who would dare?
There is always an official executioner. Trying to take the executioner's place, Is like trying to replace a master woodworker - Few would not slice their own hands.
