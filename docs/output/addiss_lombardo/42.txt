Tao engenders One, One engenders Two, Two engenders Three, Three engenders the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things carry shade And embrace sunlight. Shade and sunlight, yin and yang, Breath blending into harmony.
Humans hate To be alone, poor, and hungry. Yet kings and princes Use these words as titles.
We gain by losing, Lose by gaining.
What others teach, I also teach: "A violent man does not die a natural death. This is the basis of my teaching.
