Courage to dare kills, Courage not to dare saves. One brings profit, one brings harm.
Of these two, one is good, and one is harmful. Some are not favored by heaven. Who knows why? Even the wise consider it a difficult question.
Heaven hates what it hates - Who knows why! Even the Sage finds it difficult. Heaven's Tao does not contend But prevails, Does not speak, But responds, Is not summoned, But arrives, Is utterly still, But plans all actions.
Heaven's net is wide, wide, Loose - But nothing slips through.
