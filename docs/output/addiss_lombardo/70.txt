My words are very easy to understand, Very easy to practice. No one under heaven can understand them, No one can practice them.
Words have ancestors, Deeds have masters. If people don't understand this, They don't understand me. Few understand me, And that is my value.
Therefore the Sage wears rough clothing And carries Jade inside.
