A great nation flows down To be the world's pool, The female under heaven In stillness The female constantly overcomes the male, In stillness Takes the low place.
Therefore a great nation Lowers itself And wins over a small one. A small nation keeps itself low And wins over a great one.
Sometimes becoming low wins, Sometimes staying low wins.
A great nation desires nothing more Than to unite and protect people. A small nation desires nothing more Than to enter the service of people.
When both get what they wish The great one should be low.
