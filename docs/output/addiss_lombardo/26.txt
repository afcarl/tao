Gravity is the root of lightness, Stillness the master of passion.
The Sage travels all day But does not leave the baggage-cart; When surrounded by magnificent scenery Remains calm and still.
When a lord of ten thousand chariots Behaves lightly in this world,
Lightness loses its root, Passion loses its master.
