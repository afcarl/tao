Having some knowledge When walking on the Great Tao Only brings fear.
The great Tao is very smooth, But people like rough trails.
The government is divided, Fields are overgrown, Granaries are empty,.
But the nobles clothes are gorgeous, Their belts show off swords, And they are glutted with food and drink. Personal wealth is excessive. This is called thieves' endowment, But it is not Tao.
