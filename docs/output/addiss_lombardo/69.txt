There is a saying in the army: I do not presume to be the master, But become the guest. I do not dare advance an inch, but retreat a foot.
This is called moving without moving, rolling up sleeves without showing your arms, Repelling without opposing, Wielding without a weapon.
There is no disaster greater than Contempt for the enemy.
Contempt for the enemy - what a treasure is lost! Therefore, When the fighting gets hot, Those who grieve will conquer.
