Great Tao drifts - it can go right or go left.
The thousands of things depend on it for life, it rejects nothing. It achieves successes, but does not hold tight to the fame. It clothes and feeds the thousands of things but does not act the ruler.
Always: Desiring nothing, it can be called 'of no account.'
The thousands of things turn back to it but it does not act the ruler - it can be called 'Great'
Because in the end it does not insist on its own greatness, yes, it is able to achieve its full greatness.
