If I had the least bit of understanding I would walk on the great Way. Only display will be dangerous.
The great Way is very smooth but people love bypaths.
The court is very well kept the fields are very weedy the granaries very empty.
"Their clothes are fine and colourful on their belts are sharp swords, they are filled with food and drink" a superabundance of expensive goods. This is robbers boasting, certainly not the Way.
