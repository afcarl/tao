Everyone in the world says of me: 'great - but doesn't seem normal.' It's just 'greatness' - that's why it does not seem normal. If I were normal, I'd have been of little worth for a long time now.
I have three treasures, I protect and keep hold of them. The first is called 'gentleness' the second is called 'frugality' the third is called 'not presuming to act like leader of the world.'
Gentle, so able to be bold frugal, so able to be lavish not presuming to act like leader of the world, so able to become head of a government.
Now: To be bold without being gentle to be lavish without being frugal to act like leader without putting oneself last: This is death.
Yes, gentleness: "Attack with it and you will win defend with it and you will stand firm." When Heaven wants to rescue someone, it surrounds him with a wall of gentleness.
