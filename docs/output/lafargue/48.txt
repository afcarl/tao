"Doing Learning, one profits everyday." Doing Tao, one suffers a loss everyday -
loses, and loses some more and so arrives at not doing anything. Doing nothing, nothing will remain not done. Taking over the world: only by not working.
A person who sets to working, doesn't have what it takes to take over the world.
