Speaking little is what is natural. Yes: A whirlwind does not blow a whole morning a downpour does not fall a whole day.
And who causes these things? - Heaven and Earth. If even Heaven and Earth cannot make things last very long, how much less can man.
Yes: One devoted to Tao: Is a Tao man, merges with Tao is a Te man, merges with Te is a man left out, merges with What Is Left Out.
One who merges with Tao, Tao welcomes him one who merges with Te, Te welcomes him one who merges with What Is Left Out, What Is Left Out welcomes him.
When sincerity does not suffice, it was not sincerity.
