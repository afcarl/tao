One who has an abundance of Te is like a newborn child: Poisonous bugs will not bite it fierce beasts will not snatch it birds of prey will not attack it. Its bones are Soft, its sinews Weak, but its grip is firm.
It has not known the union of man and woman, but its organs get aroused: Vital energy at its height.
It will scream all day without getting hoarse: Harmony at its height. To experience Harmony is called being Steady to experience Steadiness is called Clarity.
'Increasing life': ominous 'the mind controlling the ch'i': forcing.
Things are vigorous, then grow old: A case of 'not-Tao'. Not-Tao, soon gone.
