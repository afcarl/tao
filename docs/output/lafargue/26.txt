Heaviness is the root of lightness Stillness is the master of agitation.
And so the Wise Person: Travels all day, not departing from the heavy baggage wagon although there are grand sights, he sits calmly aloof.
Why is this? A 10,000-chariot lord, mindful of his self takes the world lightly.
Light, then lose the Root agitated, then lose the mastery.
