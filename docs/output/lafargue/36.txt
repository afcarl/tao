When you want to shrink something you must always enlarge it. When you want to weaken something you must always strengthen it. When you want to neglect something you must always involve yourself with it. When you want to deprive something you must always give to it.
This is called 'Subtle Clarity.' Softness and Weakness overcome what is hard and strong.
"The fish must not leave the depths the state's 'sharp weapons' must not be shown to others."
