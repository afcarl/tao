My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice. No one in the world can understand, No one can practice them.
The words have an ancestor the practice has a master. They just do not understand and so they do not understand me. (So few understand me - a rare treasure indeed.)
And so the Wise Person: Dressed in shabby clothes, jade under his shirt.
