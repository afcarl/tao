Not promoting the wise and worthy brings it about that the people are not contentious.
Not prizing goods hard to come by brings it about that the people do not become thieves
Not paying attention to the desirable brings it about that the people's minds do not become disordered.
And so, the government of the Wise Person: Empty their minds, fill their bellies weaken their ambitions, strengthen their bones.
Always bring it about that the people are without knowledge and without desires. Bring it about that the clever ones do not presume to set about doing.
Do Not Doing and nothing will be left un-governed.
