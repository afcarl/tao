"When great hostilities are smoothed over there is always some hostility left." How could this be considered good?
And so the Wise Person: "Keeps hold of the left-hand contract tally, and doesn't make demands on others."
One who has Te is concerned with fulfilling his contract one who does not have Te concerns himself with collecting his due.
Heaven's Way: Not to have personal favourites, but to be invariably good to all.
