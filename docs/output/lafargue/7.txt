Heaven is lasting, Earth endures.
What enables Heaven and Earth to last and endure? Because they do not live for themselves - so it is that they can live so long.
And so, the Wise Person: Puts himself last, and so finds himself in front.
puts himself in the out group, and so maintains his place.
The personal does not exist for him - isn't this how he can perfect what for him is most personal?
