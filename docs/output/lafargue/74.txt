"The people are always lacking in the fear of death." Then why frighten them with death?
Supposing the people always had the fear of death, and we could catch law breakers and kill them - who would dare?
There is always The Executioner - he does the killing. Doing the killing in The Executioner's place, this is like "doing the cutting in the master carpenter's place." One who cuts in the master carpenter's place - seldom it is he does not cut his hand.
