Your fame or your self, which is closer to you? Your self or your possessions, which counts for more? Gaining or losing, which brings the pain?
Indeed: Very fond, much expended much hoarding, heavy loss.
Be content and there will be no disgrace. Know to stop and there will be no danger. And you can last very long.
