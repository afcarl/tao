"Bent - then mature." Compromised - then upright Empty - then solid old and spent - then young and sprightly. A little - then a gain a lot - then confusing.
And so the Wise Person: Embraces The One Thing, and becomes the Shepherd of the World.
He does not show off, so he shines he does not promote himself, so he becomes famous he does not boast of himself, so he gets the credit he does not glorify himself, so he becomes leader.
He just does not contend and so no one can contend with him.
What the ancients said: "bent - then mature," is this an empty saying? This is true maturity, turn back to it.
