Excellent traveling: no tracks or traces Excellent speaking: no blemish or blame. Excellent counting does not use counting slips.
Excellent locking: no bolt or bar, but the door cannot be opened. Excellent tying: no cord or rope, but the knots cannot be undone.
And so the Wise Person: Always Excels at rescuing people and so does not turn anyone away. Always Excels at resolving things and so does not turn away from anything. This is called 'being clothed in Clarity.'
The Excellent person is the teacher of the person who is not Excellent. The person who is not Excellent is material for the Excellent person.
Not to treasure one's teacher not to love one's material, though 'smart,' is a great mistake. This is an important secret.
