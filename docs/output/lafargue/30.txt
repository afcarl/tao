One who assists the people's rulers with Tao does not use weapons to force changes in the world. "Such action usually backfires."
Where troops camp, thorns and brambles grow.
Excellence consists in: Being resolute, that is all not venturing to take control by force
being resolute, but not boastful being resolute, but not overbearing being resolute, but not arrogant being resolute, when you have no choice being resolute, but not forcing.
Things are vigorous, then grow old and weak: A case of 'not-Tao.' Not-Tao, soon gone.
