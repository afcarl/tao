The world has a Source, the Mother of the World.
Once you get the Mother then you understand the children. Once you understand the children turn back and watch over the Mother. As to destroying the self, there will be nothing to fear.
Close your eyes shut your doors, till the end of your life you will not get tired.
Open your eyes carry on your business, till the end of your life you will not be safe.
Keeping your eyes on the Small Thing is called Clarity watching over Weakness is called strength.
Engage with the flashing things turn back to Clarity do not deliver yourself to disaster. This is cultivating Steadiness.
