Push Emptiness to the limit, watch over Stillness very firmly.
The thousands of things all around are active - I give my attention to Turning Back. Things growing wild as weeds all turn back to the Root.
To turn back to The Root is called Stillness. This is 'reporting in' 'reporting in' is becoming Steady. Experiencing Steadiness is Clarity. Not to experience Steadiness is to be heedless in one's actions - bad luck.
Experiencing Steadiness, then one is all-embracing all-embracing, then an impartial Prince Prince, then King King, then Heaven Heaven, then Tao
Tao then one lasts very long. As to destroying the self, there will be nothing to fear.
