In filling, if you keep on and on - better to have stopped.
In sharpening, if you keep trying - the edge won't last long.
When gold and jade fill the halls, no one can guard it all.
Rich, famous - and conceited: leading to a downfall self-caused.
Achieve successes, win the fame, remove yourself: Heaven's Way.
