Tao being Empty, it seems one who uses it will lack solidity.
An abyss, it seems something like the ancestor of the thousands of things.
It dampens the passion it unties the tangles it makes the flashing things harmonious it makes the dust merge together.
Deep, it is perhaps like an enduring something.
I don't know of anything whose offspring it might be - it appears to precede God.
