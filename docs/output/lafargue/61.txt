The great state is a low and easy woman for the world the one the Whole world unites with. Femininity always overcomes Masculinity, by Stillness, in Stillness it takes the low place.
Yes: A great state, by putting itself lower than the smaller state, will win out over the smaller state. A small state, by putting itself lower than the great state, will win out over the great state.
Yes: One puts itself lower so it will win out, if the other gets lower, then it will win.
(A great state has no further desire than to embrace and protect other states. A small state has no further desire than to enter and serve other states.
So both get what they want) The greatest should be the lowest.
