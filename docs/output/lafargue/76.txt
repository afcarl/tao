People begin life Soft and Weak when they are dead they are hard and firm.
Among the thousands of things: Grass and trees begin life Soft and tender when they are dead they are withered and brittle.
Yes, strength and hardness accompany death Softness and Weakness accompany life.
And so: With a battle axe too hardened, you cannot win when a tree becomes hard, then comes the axe.
The strong and the great stand lowest the Soft and Weak stand highest.
