Tao will always be nameless, an Uncarved Block although it is a thing of no account, no one in the world can make it his subject.
If the princes and kings could watch over It, the thousands of things would on their own be as deferential as guests.
Heaven and Earth would join together to send sweet dew. The people on their own would share equally without anyone giving orders.
A comparison: Tao's presence in the world is like the relation of small river valleys to the Yang-tze and the ocean.
