Governing a large state is like cooking a small fish.
Rule the world by Tao then ghosts will not take to haunting.
It is not that the ghosts will not haunt their haunting will cause no hurt to humankind. (It's not only that their haunting will not hurt humankind, the Wise Person also does not cause hurt to them.
These two do not hurt each other.) Yes, Te unifies and restores.
