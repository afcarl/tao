The Wise Person is always a man without a mind - he takes the mind of the hundred clans as his mind.
Those who are good, I am good to them those who are not good, I am also good to them - Te is good.
Those who are honest, I am honest with them those who are not honest, I am also honest with them - Te is honest.
The Wise Person lives in the world all drawn in for the world's sake he keeps his mind muddled. The hundred clans all strain their eyes and ears toward him. The Wise Person treats them all as his children.
