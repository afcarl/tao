The highest Excellence is like water. Water, Excellent at being of benefit to the thousands of things, does not contend - it settles in places everyone else avoids. Yes, it is just about Tao.
Excellence in a house: the ground "Excellence in a mind: depth Excellence in companions: Goodness Excellence in speaking: sincerity
Excellence in setting things right: good management Excellence on the job: ability Excellence in making a move: good timing."
Simply do not contend then there will be no fault.
